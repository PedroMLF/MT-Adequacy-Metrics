you know , one of the great favorites of travel and one of the joy in the race research is to live with the people who can remember the old days , and they &apos;re still feeling the past in the wind , and they &apos;re going to touch their past .
just knowing that jaguar shaans still travel beyond the milky way or the myth of the oldest of the elderly &apos;s most important , or that in the himalayas , they &apos;re still following the buddhist of the dharma , which is the idea that the world that we know are successful .
and of course , we all share the same adability .
we &apos;re all born . we &apos;re going to bring kids to the world .
we moved through rituals .
we have to talk to the intransitional separation of death , and so it should not surprise us that we all sing , dance and art .
but interesting is the unique sound of the word , the rhythm of dance in every culture .
it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s about the commute in the forests of borneo , or the voodoo akolyth in haiti , or the warrior in the olympic desert of northern kenya , the cures in the middle of the sahara , or a barwanhoan in the middle of the desert that i traveled to a month ago , or even a yaniani of the world .
all of these people teach us that there are other ways of living , other ways of thinking differently about the earth .
and this is an idea that , if you can think about it , one with hope .
together , the vast cultures of the world form a network of spirituent and cultural lives , which are rejoking the earth , and it &apos;s just as important to the earth as the biological landscape you know .
you can think of this cultural life network as a race sphere , ethnic nosphere can be the total sum of all thoughts and dreams , myths , ideas and intuitive ideas that have been treated by the beginnings of consciousness since the beginning of consciousness .
the ethnosphere is the great legacy of humanity .
it &apos;s the symbol of all of what we are and what we are astonishingly capable of .
and just as the biosphere got strong , this happened with the ethnosphere -- just with greater speed .
for example , not a biologist would say that 50 percent or more of all sorts of species are very short before extinction , because it &apos;s simply not true , and yet , this -- the apokalyptic case on the area of biological diversity -- it &apos;s hardly what &apos;s known to us as optimized .
and the key indicator for this is extinction .
when each of you were born in this room , 66,000 languages were spoken on earth .
now , a language isn &apos;t just the sum of the word or a series of grammatic .
a language is the human spirit .
it &apos;s a means of dealing with the local soul of a certain culture .
every language is like an ancient forest of the mind , a turning point , an idea of spiritual possibilities .
and from those 64,000 languages today , while we &apos;re sitting here in monterey , that &apos;s not exactly half the ears of children .
they &apos;re not taught a little kids . that means if nothing is done , they &apos;re actually dead .
what could be more lonely than the silence of being one of the last kids who talk to their language , no possibility to have the wisdom of the ancestors , or the hope of the hope to expect to expect ?
and yet , this terrible destiny is actually going to be someone in the world somewhere in the world , about every two weeks , because every two weeks , an older person dies and takes the last syllling of an old language .
and i know some of you say , &quot; well , it &apos;s not better ? &quot; it wouldn &apos;t be a better place , if we just talk about one language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s be that language yoruba . let &apos;s be canuba . &quot;
let &apos;s be cogi . &quot;
and then you would suddenly recognize how it would be if you couldn &apos;t speak your own language .
so i &apos;d like to take you on a journey today through the race of race , a short journey through the race of race to try to understand what &apos;s actually lost .
now there are some of us who are sort of forgotten that when i say &quot; different possibilities of being , &quot; they really different ways of being .
take for example , this kid of the barasana in the northwest of the amazon , the people of the andelda , believe that they came from the east of sacred snakes in the belly of saint snakes .
this is a people who &apos;s not cognitively different between the colors of blue and green , because the sky is the forest that people depend on .
they have a strange language , and a lovely language is called the linguistic exotic disorder : you have to marry somebody who talks a different language .
all of this back in the mythological past , which is the strange one of these big houses , because of the misdog six or seven languages , but is that you will never hear someone who learns a language .
they just listen and start talking .
or , one of the most intriguing tribes that i &apos;ve ever lived with , the waorani in the northeast of ecuador , was tested by an amazing people in 1958 .
in 1957 , five missionars were trying to capture and make a severe mistake .
they threw bright photos from the air down , which we would grade as a friendly gesture , and they forgot that these people from the rainforest in their lives have never seen anything a two-dimensional .
they took these photographs from the forest floor , tried to see behind the face or the character , found nothing , and they found that this is business maps of the devil and killing the five missionos .
but the waorani didn &apos;t just get outside with the spears .
they moved on to each other .
54 percent of deaths happened through power .
we were looking back at the genetic generations , and we found two cases of a natural death and when we asked people to do something about it , they gave them that one of the people had become so old because of his age , and we killed it with the spears .
but at the same time , they had a clear knowledge of the forest that was amazing .
they could smell the urine of an animal from 40 steps away , and determine what kind of animal that was .
in the early 80- years , i got a really amazing job when my professor asked whether i was interested in getting to haiti and the secret societies that were the foundation of duiner and clay clay and the poison that was used to make zombies .
in order to give a sense of this , i had to know something about this remarkable belief of the vodoun , and voodoo is not a cult of black magic .
in the opposite , it &apos;s a complex metaphysical view .
it &apos;s interesting .
if i would ask you , the big world prints , what would you say ?
christanity , islam , buddhism , disciplism , or whatever .
a continent is always going to leave , because the guess was that in sub-saharan africa , there was no religious belief . of course , there was one and voodoo is just the exaggeration of this very deep religious thought that came out during the tragic diaspora .
but what voodoo does so interesting is this life relationship between the living and the dead .
the people who have the minds .
the spirits can be sucked up by the great water , answers to the rhythm of dance , in order to maintain the soul of the living temporary moment , so that the accelerth for a short moment becomes god .
i like to say the voodoo , &quot; you &apos;re going to go to church and talk about god .
we dance in the temple and become god . &quot;
and because you &apos;re obsessed , you &apos;re going to get away from your mind . how can you get damage ?
look at these amazing demonstrations : voodoo-akolyth in a transcestate , the fireend coal without glue , an amazing illustration of the spirit of the mind that it &apos;s going to affect the body of extreme arousal .
now , from all the people i met , the kogi was out of the sierra nevada of santa marta in northern columbia , the most extraordinary .
the old tyrannis civilization , the coallobic coast of columbia , and in a row , moved this people into an isolated volcano massive , which goes up over the coallobic coast .
in a bloodset continent , these people were the only ones who were never conquered by the nazis .
until today &apos;s day , you &apos;re going to run from a ritual pristership , but education is very extraordinary .
the young acolyors are separated in the age of three and four years from their families , and in a shadow world of finmia , in stone hatches on the glacier of the glacier for 18 years , and two times of each time to mimic the nine months of pregnant mother they spend in the lap of the great mother .
and during this whole time , they &apos;re culturally introduced to the values of their society , values that maintain the claim that their prayers and just their prayers , the cosmic , or we could say the ecological -- balance .
at the end of the amazing initiation , you &apos;ll suddenly be taken out of one day , and for the first time in your life , at age 18 , you see a sundrop , and in this crystal clear moment of the first light when the sun starts to plant the gray beautiful landscape , suddenly everything i told you .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you need to protect it . &quot;
they call the older brothers and say that we are the younger brothers that are responsible for the destruction of the world .
now this level of intuition is very important .
whenever we think about one-born and landscape , we can either rousseau and the old torch of the noste wild , which is a lsistic thought , or on the other hand , and say these people are more connected to nature than we are .
so , born , you &apos;re not sentimental , you &apos;ll be fooled by the nostalgy .
it &apos;s not a lot of space for the malaria in the south atlantic of the asmat or the cold winds of tibet , but still , through time and ritual , shaped a mysterious nimbus of the earth , which is the idea that the earth will only breathe because it &apos;s going to breathe in the human consciousness .
now , what does that mean ?
it means that a small child is growing out of the anion that &apos;s growing up in the belief that the mountain is an apu-mind , which is going to be a very different person , will be a very different human being , and a different relationship to this resource , which can be used in the believe that a mountain can be used .
whether he &apos;s a seat of a mind or a bunch of them , is irrelevant .
the interesting thing is the metaphor that determines the relationship between the individual and the nature .
i grew up in the woods of britically columbia , and i believed that these forests are going to be there .
this made me a different other person than my friends under the kwae , who believe that these forests of the course of hukuk and the bobotic spirits are colder , and the cannitic spirits , that they would be involved in the north of the world , ghosts that they were involved in their hamatsa .
now , if you start looking at the idea that these cultures can create different realities , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries , like this plant here .
it &apos;s a photograph i took only last april in the northwest of the amazon .
this is ayahuasca , from which many of you have heard the most powerful psychoals from the repertoire of shame .
what ayahuasca is so fascinating is not just the pharmaceutical potential of this preparment , but it &apos;s made out of two different sources . it &apos;s actually made of two different sources . on the one hand , there are these wooden caps that have a series of betads , harmin , harmolin , resmolles , it &apos;s about the leaves of the coffee of coffee .
this is a plant that contains a lot of very strong tryptamine that the serotonin diyptamine diyptamine &apos;s five and practical .
if you &apos;ve seen the yanomai , you &apos;ve seen this stuff square , this substance that you create from various kinds of species , and that kind of substance you made of different species as well .
now , this powder is about as much as being cut out of a barrel of a gun , and you &apos;ve got a light shot on a sea of electricity .
it will not revolutionize reality , but the resolution of reality .
i even have with my professor , richard evan shultes , the man who had the psychedelists , the discovery of the magic mushrooms with the discovery of the magic mushrooms in mexico , and i said , you know , you can &apos;t relate to that tryptamine as a hallucination to experience a hallucination .
but the thing about tryptamins is that they &apos;re not going to be an eighth , because they &apos;re in a human gut , of course , called monoamin-oxidase .
you can only connect with some of the other chemicals that mao denatriter is .
now , the fascinating thing is that the caps that are in the lieves are , mao-customization of exactly the way that it &apos;s necessary to empower the tryptamine . so ask yourself .
how can these people come from a hoora of 80,000 species of adhtasingia plants that are two morphologically related plants that , if in this way combined , create a kind of biochemical version that &apos;s so much larger than the sum of its parts ?
we use this great euphemism , trial and error , which turns out to be meaningless .
but you ask the indian people , &quot; the plant speaks to us . &quot;
so what does that mean ?
this tribe , the cofan , has 17 varieties of ayahuasca , which you all see at a big distance in the forest , which is a kind of sound .
and then you ask them how to do their taxonomy and say , &quot; i thought you understand some of the plants .
i mean , you know nothing ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
so , it turns out you take every one of the 17 variants in full moon , and you sing it into a different pitch .
now , that doesn &apos;t bring you a ph.d. at harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting to count as a tribe .
well , the problem -- the problem is that even those of us who have become sympathy for the difficult situation , they think of as orginialism and colorful , but somehow limited to the past , while the real world , meaning our world .
so , the fact is that you &apos;re not going to remember the 20th century , in 300 years , not for its war or technical innovation , but rather than an era in which we were against and the massive destruction of biological and cultural diversity on earth . so the problem is not the change .
all cultures have been involved in the dance with new life possibilities .
and the problem is not technology .
the seminous indian stopped not being less on sioux than they were pumping and arrows , when americans were listening to americans , when they were the horse and horses .
not change and technology , the integrity of race , it &apos;s power . the ugly face of the rule .
and you could see that in the world , you &apos;re not going to discover that these cultures are not the set of it . these are dynamic living peoples , their existence in terms of effable forces that are going to go away through their capacity .
or if we go to the mountains of tibet , where i research a lot , you &apos;ll see ugly face of political dominance .
you know , the genocide , the physical extinction of people in general will be convicted , but the race , the destruction of the lives of the people , will not only be convicted of it , but in general and more ambitious than a developing strategy .
and you can &apos;t understand the suffering of mind if you haven &apos;t experienced it on the ground .
i traveled to a young fellow with a young colleague of chnardu in westchina by southeast tibet , and only when i came to lhasa , i saw the face behind the statistics you hear . 66,000 sacred monuments that were killed in high school and asasns .
the father of this young man was identified as a followers .
it meant that he was killed during the chinese invasion .
his uncle flh with her holiness in the diaspora who brought people to nepal .
his mother became locked as a punishment for -- to be for crimes .
he was stuck in the prison of two years in the prison of two years to hide under her rock balls because she couldn &apos;t live it .
the sister , who did these taeks , was brought to an educational camp .
one day she came out of a wrid-band maos , and he had to put it in a heavy job camp for seven years .
the suffering of the mind can be intolerable , but the spirit of people &apos;s minds is something incomplete .
and at the end , we &apos;re really in front of a choice . do we want to live in a monochromatic world of monpartisonia or in a polychromatic world of diversity ?
margaret mead , the great anthropologist said , before she died , it &apos;s their greatest fear that while we &apos;re in the direction of a thread , we &apos;re going to move the whole bandwidth of the human imagination , not just the entire bandwidth of the human imagination , but that we would wake up from a dream , and we forgot that there were no other options .
and it &apos;s humbling to think that our species have existed for 600,000 years .
the neolithic revolution , which brought us agriculture , and in this moment , the cult of the seed corms , the poetry of the shame of the prievers and the hierarchy , and specialization , was only about 10,000 years ago .
modern industrial world as we know it is not 300 years old .
now , this surface story doesn &apos;t tell me that we all have answers to the challenges that we are in the recent years .
if we &apos;re going to ask these academic world cultures to be human , they respond to 10,000 different voices .
and in this song , we &apos;re going to rediscover the possibility to be what we are : people with the full awareness that are aware of the importance that all people and gardens have to flourish , and there &apos;s great moments of optimism .
here &apos;s a photograph i took on the northern end of the baffin islands when i went to the naroist hunt , and this man , olbr , told me a wonderful story of his granddad .
the canadian government is not always very good with the inuit , and during the years in the suburbs of the publishing of our rule , they were forced to move in settlements .
the grandfather of this old man refused .
the family , the fear of his life , took all the weapons and all the tools .
now you have to know that the inuit don &apos;t have fear of the cold . they used it to their advantage .
the tracks seemed to have been made out of fish in the first place , which was made in combat skin .
the man &apos;s grandfather wasn &apos;t worried about the arctic night or the wheel .
he hatched out , he made his pants out of sedogshide , and detarred in his hand , and when the feces started fried , he formed her in the shape of a diagram .
he stole on the side of the top of the camels , and when it was completely frozen , it &apos;s sort of a dog with it .
he put the dog , and he sat down a little bit of the dog , took the skeleton of the dog and improvised a bad , spanish dog , a different dog on the beaches .
you can &apos;t do anything like that .
and this is a symbol for the resistance of the inuit and all born on the world .
the canadian government gave the inuit in april of 1999 , the complete control of an area that &apos;s bigger than california and texas combined .
it &apos;s our new country and it &apos;s called the avke-.
it &apos;s an independent area . they control all of the crops .
an amazing example , as a nation , a state , a state , can look for refine with its inhabitable and achieve .
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who traveled to those distant goals of the earth , to realize that they &apos;re not away at all .
they &apos;re the home countries of somebody .
they represent the parts of the human imagination that go back in past times , and for all of us , the dreams of these kids are going to be the dreams of our own children in the geography of hope .
what we ultimately try to do at national geographic is we think politicians never achieve something .
we think polemik -- we believe that polemik is not persuasive , but we believe that storytelling can change the world and therefore we &apos;re probably the best institution for storytelling in the world . our website gets 35 million people every month .
156 nations are sending up our television channel .
our magazines are read by millions .
and we do a series of travel in the ethnic sphere where we take our audiences to places like this from such cultural wonder that they &apos;re going to take off and hopefully think of one after the other , and hopefully , they will find a critical possibility in a really multicultural pluralist world that the wisdom of all people can do .
thank you .
what i first do , as quickly as possible , will show , is the fundamental work , a new technology that we microsoft , that we have as part of an overstick year of a year , coadragon . and it &apos;s an environment that you can do with a huge amount of visual data .
we see a lot of , many gigabytes of digital photographs here , which you &apos;re seamless , and you &apos;re going to pick up , and you can rearrange it in any way .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how many information we look at , how big these collections are or how big the images are .
most of you are digital photographs of a camera , but this is for example , a scan of congress and it &apos;s 300 megabyixles .
it doesn &apos;t matter , because the only thing that can do the performance of a system like this is the number of pixels on your screen in every moment . it has a very flexible architecture .
this is a whole book , an example of non-visual data .
this is blider house of dickens . every spold is a chapter .
to prove that it &apos;s really about a text and not a picture , we can do something like that to really show that this is a real representation of the proton and no image .
maybe this is an artificial way to read a book book .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
this is a realistic case . this is a copy of the guardian .
every big picture is the beginning of a decline .
and that really gives you the pleasure and the good experience to read a real paper copy of a magazine or a newspaper , which is a kind of a medium with multiple scales .
we also did something about the corner of this particular copy of the guardian .
we designed a false display with very high resolution that &apos;s much higher than a normal display , and we added more content .
if you want to see the functions of this car , you can see them here .
or other models , or even technical species .
and this is actually hitting these ideas , these limitations of the existing space on the screen .
we hope that that doesn &apos;t mean a pop-up and other nonsense , that should not be necessary .
of course , the mapping is one of the really obvious applications for technology like this .
and i really don &apos;t want to spend a lot of time , except to say that we &apos;re going to contribute to this area .
but these are all the streets in the united states .
overcoming up on the cutting picture of nasa .
let &apos;s get something out now .
now that &apos;s actually live in the internet . you can test it .
this is a project called photosynth , which is really two different technologies combined .
one is seadragon and the other one is a very good research on computer vision , which is a college student university student in washington , under the counseling of steve tritz on the uw .
and rick szeliski was done by microsoft , a very good collaboration .
so this is live in the internet . it &apos;s powered by seadragon .
you can see that if we create these kinds of views where we can penetrate through images , and that experience of multiple times .
but the spatial distribution of the images is actually important .
so the computer general algorithms , they put these pictures together with the real room , where these images that were made close to all of them in the eastern rockies in the canadian rockies , they look at these elements of all the space , and they &apos;ve got all the space in relation to each other .
i don &apos;t know exactly whether i have time to show you other environments .
there are those who are much more space .
i would like to show one of the original data sets of noah and this is from an early prototype of photosynth that we &apos;ve been working on in summer to show you what i think is really the punch line that we have on the website .
we had to worry about the lawyers , etc .
this is a reconstructed of the cathedral , which was the only in the computer with the images of flickr , and just give you emergency lady in flickr , and you &apos;re going to get pictures of men in t-shirts and on the university site , and every one of these cases is an image that was detected as this model .
so this is all patr-images , and they &apos;re all in space that way .
and we can navigate this very simple way .
you know , i &apos;ve never believed that i will eventually work at microsoft .
i &apos;m very grateful for the empirification here .
and i suspect you can see that this is a lot of different types of cameras : everything is , from the hand camera to professional slrs , a pretty big number of them , which are all wrapped together in this environment .
and if possible , i &apos;ll find some of the weird ones .
many of them are covered by faces .
here &apos;s a series of photographs -- here you are .
this is actually a poster from an emergency lady that was recorded right .
we can change from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
the point here is that we can do things with social environment , and it will now be collected data from all -- from the entire collective memory of how , like visual the earth looks -- and everything will be connected .
all these pictures are connected to each other , and it creates something larger than the sum of the parts .
they get a model that comes from all over the earth .
consider this as the sequel of the most of stephen laws of virtual earth .
and this is something that comes through the complexity that people use , growing it and use it for the user .
their own photos will be labeled with metadata , which has a different person .
if someone has the trouble , and it has all of these sacred dissections and sharing who they all are , then my photo of the emergency cathedral is all given to all this data , and i can use it as an approach to enter in this kind of metaverse , the photos of other people , and so on to the use of others .
and of course , side product all of those are the immense virtual models of any interesting part of the earth , not only through flights or satellite images and so on , but through collective memory .
thank you .
do i understand you right ? your software is allowing you to have a certain point , within the next few years , all the images that are being used in common in the world ?
yes . it doesn &apos;t make anything else .
if you want to create hyperlinks between the images .
and she does this because of the content in the images .
and that &apos;s really exciting when you think about the amount of semantic information that many of these images have .
as you do a web search for pictures , where you &apos;re making sentences and the text of the website there &apos;s a lot of information about it , which is the picture .
but how if the picture you connect with all your pictures ?
then the scale of the semantic cross-link and the abundance that makes it really enormous , it &apos;s a classic web effect .
blaise , that &apos;s really incredible . congratulations .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m going to tell you some things from my book , which is how i hope with other things they &apos;ve already heard about , and i &apos;m going to try to make some connections , if you haven &apos;t noticed that .
i want to start with what i call &quot; official dogma . &quot;
the official dogma of what ?
the official belief of all western industrial societies .
the official dogma works like this : when our goal is to maximize the public well-being of our citizens , it &apos;s all about the most part of the freedom of freedom of freedom .
the reason for this is that freedom is good in itself , valuable , meaning , an unknowable assumption for human .
if people have freedom , then every one of us is for themselves to do things that maximize our common and no one has to decide for us .
the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice .
the more choices people have , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , the more common they have .
this is , i think , so deep in our water supply , that it would never come in the sense of it .
and it &apos;s also deep in our lives .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what modern progress enables us .
this is my supermarket . no big .
i just want to say something about salatsy .
there &apos;s 175 dresings in my supermarket , if you don &apos;t count the 10 different olive olive oil , and you could buy 12 balseed groups that you could buy to make a large number of other tuppings in the inprobable case that no one &apos;s 175 in the store for you .
so that &apos;s how the supermarket is .
and then you go to the consumer electronics around a stereo plant -- speaker , cd-player , a putta-player , radio , destronger . and there are so many stereo in this one electronics .
we can put together 6,5 million different stereo from the components that are offered in this one store .
you have to admit that this is a big choice .
in other parts -- the world of communication .
there was a time when i was a young boy , because you could have a phone seat every telephone you wanted , as long as you came from ma bell .
they rented her phone . they didn &apos;t buy it .
a consequence was that the telephone was never broken .
these days are over .
we now have almost an infinite choice of phones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
my favorite , it &apos;s in the middle -- mp3 playerar , nas-hammers and crème brcock lcock .
and if you haven &apos;t seen it yet in your business , you can be sure you &apos;ll soon be .
and what it does is it makes people running into business and asking that question .
now , do you know what the answer is ?
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
it &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
in other aspects of life that are very significant to buy , the same explosion of choice is in choice .
health -- it &apos;s no longer the case in the united states that they go to the doctor and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , you go to the doctor and the doctor says to you : we could do a , or we could do b .
a has these benefits and risks .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
and they say , &quot; doctor , what do i do ? &quot;
the doctor says a has these benefits and risks and b has the benefits and risks .
what do you want to do ?
and if you say , &quot; if you were , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not it . &quot;
the result is -- we call it &quot; patient autonomy . &quot; that sounds like a good thing , but in reality , it &apos;s a shift of the amount of responsibility for someone who knows a little bit -- name somebody who knows nothing about it -- namably the patient .
there &apos;s an enormous marketing for enwriting drugs like you and me , that if you think about it , doesn &apos;t make sense , because we don &apos;t buy them .
why do they hire us if we can &apos;t buy ?
the answer is , you expect to call the doctor the next morning and ask for a change of the competition .
something so profound like our identity is a question of how to show this slide .
we don &apos;t get identity ; we invent them .
and we &apos;re so often reinventing ourselves as we want .
that means every day , if you wake up the morning , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time when the standard assumption was that almost everybody had one , and they were so fast as they could , and then kids were getting like they could .
the only choice was &quot; who , &quot; not when , and not what they did after that .
now , everything is easy to have .
i teach wonderful intelligent students , and i &apos;ll give you 20 percent less work than i used to do .
and that &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , and not because they &apos;re very careful .
it &apos;s because they &apos;re busy with other things , they ask themselves , &quot; should i marry or not ? should i marry ?
should i get married later ? should i have kids , or do i do a career ? &quot;
they &apos;re all different questions .
and you &apos;re going to answer these questions regardless of whether this means all the tasks that i &apos;m going to give you , and i don &apos;t get a good grade in my course .
and in fact , you should do that . these are important questions to answer .
work -- we &apos;re blessed , as carl demonstrates , with the technology that allows us to work every single minute from every place on the planet -- to the marginic hotel .
and by the way , there &apos;s a corner that i &apos;m not going to tell you about , which is the wireless address .
i &apos;m not going to tell you , because i want to use it .
so what it means , that incredible freedom of choice we have in terms of making decisions decisions , again and again , whether we should work or not work .
we can play our children playing in football , and we have our mobile phone on a hip , and our blackberry to others , and our laptop probably on our lap .
and even though they &apos;re all turned off , every minute we &apos;re mutiling on our child &apos;s game , we &apos;re also saying , &quot; should i accept this call ?
should i say that email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
and even if the answer to the question &quot; no , &quot; it &apos;s certainly going to be your experience of your child &apos;s mouth very different than it would have been .
wherever we look , big things and little things , physical things and lifestyle , life is a question of choice .
and the world in which we lived looked like this .
so i want to say there were some choices , but not everything was a question of choice .
and the world in which we see lives now .
and the question is , is that good or bad news ?
the answer is yes .
we all know what &apos;s good about it , so i &apos;m going to do something bad about it .
all these choices have two effects , two negative effects on people .
a paradox , paradoxically , is that he &apos;s convicted of free .
with so many options you can choose , people are very hard to decide at all .
i &apos;m going to give you another drastic example of this , a study about investment in volunteers .
a colleague of mine had access to investment records of vanature , which is a giant fondsociety of about a million employees and about 2,000 of the different jobs .
and what she found was a 10 investment fund that the employer offered , the participation was about two percent .
they &apos;re offering 50 investment fund -- 10 percent less employees take part than just five . why ?
because it &apos;s 50 investment fund that comes to the choices , it &apos;s so hard to decide what to choose in tomorrow .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow never comes .
you know , it &apos;s not just that people need to eat dog food if they go into the retirement , because they don &apos;t have enough money to go on , it means the decisions that make decisions so hard that they provide big investment .
they &apos;re not giving up until 5,000 dollars a year on the workforce who would have been happy to raise their contributions .
paralysis is a consequence of many choices .
and i think it makes the world look like this .
they really want to meet the decision , if it &apos;s for all the eternal , right ?
they don &apos;t want to choose the wrong investment fund , or even the wrong salch .
so this is an effect . the other effect is that even if we reach the paralysis and make a decision , we end up happy with the outcome of choice , when we had the opportunity to decide between less possibilities .
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is , by the great selection of different salatings , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and , you know , salatsy is perfect ? it &apos;s easy to imagine that they have a different choice , even if it was a good decision .
the more opportunities there are , the more basic it is not to regret at all , that &apos;s disappointing for choice that they meet .
secondly , what economists call opwig costs .
dan gilbert did a great point of this morning by telling how much the way we evaluate things , depends on what we compare .
well , if there &apos;s a lot of alternative to think about it , it &apos;s just more attractive to imagine of alternatives that you can close to , that makes you feel less happy with the alternatives that you &apos;ve chosen .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not new york , i apologize .
but here &apos;s what you should have thought .
here &apos;s a couple on the hamptons .
very expensive real estate .
beautiful beach . great day . they all have it for themselves .
what could be better ? &quot; damn the man thinks , &quot; it &apos;s august .
everyone in my manhattan neighborhood is gone .
i could park directly before my house . &quot;
and he spends two weeks from the thought that he missed the possibility , day to have a great parking parking .
opperric costs lower happiness that we get through our choices , even though what we &apos;ve chosen is fantastic .
and the more opportunities that we have , the more attractive properties of these choices are going to take place in the opperram cost .
here &apos;s another example .
now , this cartoon makes some statements .
he makes a statement about it now , and maybe doing things slowly .
but one more important thing that he does is : always who you choose for one thing , you don &apos;t choose to do other things .
and these other things may have more attractive traits , and it &apos;s going to be what they &apos;re going to do less attraction .
third : eskalation of expectations .
this has met me when i wanted to replace my jeans .
i wear jeans , almost all the time .
and there was a time in which there was a kind of jeans , and they bought it , and they bought them bad , they were incredibly imcompatible and if they carried it long enough , they started feeling &quot; ok . &quot;
so , to buy new jeans for many years of the owner , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have a few jeans , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
and the salesman said , &quot; do you want to leave your head , can you make it easy ?
do you want buttons or mastery ? stone or acid ?
do you want jeans with holes ?
you &apos;d like to cut down a long , blah , blah blah , blah , and so on .
my jaw was down , and after i was told , i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have the way that the only way it was . &quot;
he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour trying to get all of these damn jeans , and i got the business -- and i say the truth -- with the best passend of jeans i ever had .
i had better . all these choices allowed me to have better .
but i felt worse .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try and explain it to me .
the reason that i felt worse was that i felt worse with all these available options , my expectations of what a good few jeans , went up .
i had very low expectations . i had no particular expectations when it was only in a way .
when they came in 100 ways , it should have been perfect .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so i compared to what i had expected to do , and what i had was disappointing in comparison with what i expected .
add that choice to people &apos;s lives is inevitably increasing the expectations that people are going to have about this .
and this leads to less happiness , even though the results are good .
no one in the world of marketing knows this . because , if you would , you wouldn &apos;t know what it is .
the truth is more like this .
the reason is that it was all better than anything worse than anything worse than anything was worse for people to make a comfortable surprise .
today , in the world in which we live -- we wealthy , industrial citizens , with perfection as an expectation -- the best one you hope is that things are so good as you expect .
they will never be satisfied , because their expectations , my expectations , are high .
the secret to happiness -- that &apos;s what they &apos;ve all come -- the secret to happiness is low expectations .
i want to say -- a short autobiographical moment -- i &apos;m married with a woman , and she &apos;s really wonderful .
i couldn &apos;t have done it better . i didn &apos;t leave myself .
but it &apos;s not always a bad thing .
finally , a consequence of the department of buying a bad dancer , if there &apos;s just one way to buy it , and you &apos;re wondering why , who &apos;s responsible , the answer is clear . what would you have to do ?
if hundreds of different kinds of jeans are available , and they &apos;re buying the disappointing , and they ask why , who is responsible ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer to the question is : you .
they could have better .
with 100 different kinds of jeans in the window , there &apos;s no excuse for mistakes .
and so , if people make decisions , and even if the results of choices are good , they feel disappointed about it , they &apos;re accused of themselves .
clinical depression exploded in the industrial world in the last generation .
i think a significant -- not the only one , but a significant committee of depression , and also suicide , is that people have experienced the disappointing because their standards are so high . and then when they have to explain this experience , they would be blame .
and so this is the image that it &apos;s better in general , objective , and we feel worse .
so let me remind you .
this is the official dogma that we all think is right , completely wrong . it &apos;s not true .
there &apos;s no question that is a little bit better than not , but it doesn &apos;t follow the more choices than something choice .
there &apos;s a magical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we &apos;ve missed this point for a long period of time .
now , when a policy question -- i &apos;m almost finished -- as a policy question , which is about thinking about it . what all of these choices allow in the developed societies is wealth .
there are a lot of places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard about many of them , their problem is not too big .
your problem is you have too little .
so the things i &apos;m talking about are a strange problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what is so frustrating and angry is , steve levitt told them about how these expensive and hard children don &apos;t help to install their car seats . it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy to help you .
they even hurt .
you worry that we &apos;re worse for it .
if one of the things that allows us to make our society so decisions is to have the societies in which people have shifted too little choices , wouldn &apos;t it just improve the lives of people , but we will also be improved .
economists call this a pareto improvement .
income distribution is going to make it better -- not just the poor -- it &apos;s not just the poor -- because all of these big choices will lead us .
finally , please read this cartoon , and , a high-developed person , says , &quot; ah ! what does this fish know ?
you don &apos;t know anything in this gold glass glass . &quot;
the imagination , a short view of the world -- and that is the way i read it first .
but the more i thought about it , the more i got to the point that the fish knows .
because the truth is that if you break the gold glass , it &apos;s all possible , you don &apos;t have freedom . you have paralysis .
if you break the gold glass , it &apos;s all possible , lower happiness .
they increase the paralysis and lower happiness .
everybody needs a gold glass glass .
this is almost too limited with complete security -- potentially for the fish , definitely for us .
but it &apos;s a recipe from a metaphorical gold bottle of fish , and , i guess , disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects before , about the human genome and what that might mean , and the discovery of new groups of genes .
in fact , we start from a new point : we developed the biology , and now we &apos;re trying to get from the digital code into a new phase of biology by designing new lives and building .
we &apos;ve always tried to ask meaningful questions .
what &apos;s life ? it &apos;s something that i think many biologists have tried to understand and that &apos;s on different levels .
we &apos;ve tried different approaches to simplify it up to the minimum components .
we &apos;ve developed almost 20 years when we sequenced the humangenome genome of the world of biology in the digital world of the computer .
now , are we trying to ask if we can regenerate or create life &apos;s life , from this digital universe ?
this is the map of a small organism , whitney lasma violin , who has the smallest genome of a species that can replicate the smallest genome in the lab , and we tried to do that with a smaller genome .
we &apos;ve done it in about a hundred genes from the 500 or something that are here .
but if we look at these metabolic map , which is very simple , compared to our , trust me , that &apos;s simple . but if we look at all of these genes that we can do , it &apos;s very unlikely that it would lead to a living cell .
so we decided that it &apos;s the only way to engineer this chromosome , actually , to synthetic what allows us to vary the individual components and ask some of these fundamental questions .
and so we started with the question , can we engineer a chromosome ?
it allows the chemistry to make these really large molecules , which has never been done before ?
and if we can , we can start the chromosome ?
a chromosome is so only a piece of chemical material .
our steps in the form of life were exponentially .
our ability to write genetic code is very slow , but nevertheless , and our final point is to put on an exponential curve .
we started 15 years ago .
it actually took some years to start with a bioethical review before we did the first experiments .
as it turns out , dna synthetic is very difficult .
there are tens of thousands of machines that can make small pieces of dna around the world , 30 to 50 letters long , but it &apos;s a degeneric process , so the longer you make a piece , the more mistakes happen .
so we had to develop a new way of putting these little pieces together , and the mistakes could correct .
this was our first attempt , starting with the digital information , the genome phi x 174 .
it &apos;s a little virus killing bacteria .
we made small pieces , made a mistake of error , and had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
the exciting phase came when we took this piece of chemical and gave it into a bacterium , and the bacteria started reading the genetic code and made viral particles .
the viral particles were then given up by the cells and came back and killed .
recently , i spoke to the oil industry , and they said they had this model exactly .
they laughed more than they do .
so we think that this is a situation in the software that can actually build its own hardware in a biological system .
but we wanted to go far further . we wanted to build a whole bacterium , and it has more than 580,000 letters genetic code , so we thought we could build it from the size of the gun to understand what the single components of a living cell are .
design is the key , and if you want to start with digital information in the computer , this digital information has to be really error .
when we first sequenced the genome in 1995 , the error rate was a mistake of 10,000 base pairs .
we found 30 errors , if we were using the original sequence , it would never have been possible .
part of the design is to create pieces that are 50 letters long , and the other 50 letters have to overlay pieces to build smaller sub-units that fit together .
we have unique elements here .
you may have heard that we have watermarks .
think about it : we have a four-letter code : a , c , g and t.
triplets of this letter -- these letters encode about 20 amino acids , and there &apos;s a single purpose for each of these amino acids .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , sentences , thoughts .
at first we just wrote signed .
some people were disappointed that it was not poetry .
we &apos;ve designed the pieces that we could just break them up with enzymes . there are enzymes that are going to repair them and put them together .
and we started to make pieces , starting with pieces of the five to seventh letters in australia , and they had these meetings to make 24,000-letter pieces that are going back to 72,000 .
in every one of the time , we &apos;ve produced these pieces on overboard so we could sequence them , because we tried to create a very robust process what they &apos;re going to see in a minute .
we &apos;ve tried to get to the point of automation .
so , this looks like a basketball playoff .
when we get to these really big pieces -- over 100,000 base pairs -- they &apos;re not just going to grow in e.
we knew about a mechanism of homologist called recombination , which uses biology to repair dna that can bring these pieces together .
here &apos;s an example of this . there &apos;s an organism called deinococcus radiodurans for three million bicycle radiation .
you see in the upper field that his chromosome just falls apart .
and 12 to 24 hours later , everything has put together as it was .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
these organisms can be completely dry , they can actually live in the vacuum .
i &apos;m absolutely sure life exists in space , and it can move to the search for aquatic conditions .
in fact , nasa has shown that there &apos;s a lot of it out there .
here &apos;s a weekly shot of the molecule that we &apos;ve made by using these processes -- actually , we &apos;ve used only hefe-use mechanisms with the right design of the pieces we have . yeast is going to add this together automatically .
this is not electron microscopes , it &apos;s a regular microscopic shot .
it &apos;s such a big molecule that we can even see it with light microscope .
these are footage over a period of six seconds .
that &apos;s the publication that we did recently .
these are over 580,000 letters of genetic code . it &apos;s the largest molecule with defined structure that has ever been created by humans .
it has a molecular weight of over 300 million .
if we were going to print it with an mri size of 10 and without the surface , it would include 142 pages , just to print these genetic code .
now , how do we start a chromosome ? how do we turn it ?
obviously , it &apos;s a very simple virus . it &apos;s much more complicated to deal with bacteria .
it &apos;s also easier if you &apos;re in eukaryoni like we are , you just take out the nucleus and give you another one , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;ve all heard about cloning .
archaebacteria is the chromosome in the cell , but recently we &apos;ve shown that you can do a complete transplant of a cell from a cell to the other .
we were willing to clean up the chromosome of a microspecies species , and we said these two , as far as people and mice , we were able to choose some extra genes to destroy this chromosome , and it was very amazing when we gave it to a cell .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
in fact , we thought this is the end , but we tried to get the process a little bit further .
this is the main mechanism of evolution here .
we find all kinds of species here that have a second chromosome , or a third of any where , every time there are thousands of characteristics in just one second .
so people who think of evolution as a gene will have changed a lot of the biology .
there are enzymes called the restrictiones that are actually called dna .
the chromosome in the cell has no one ; the chromosomes we &apos;ve added .
it turned out to be expricted in the cell and realized the other chromosome as an alien material , and so we ended up with a cell with a new chromosome .
and the blue turned out to be blue because of the genes we added .
and after a very short period of time , it had lost all the characteristics of species , and it completely relates to a new species based on the new software that we &apos;ve given in the cell .
all the proteins changed , the membranes changed -- when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we did .
it may sound like genome alkey , but we can , by raising the software dna , things quite dramatic .
now i &apos;m afraid that this is not the disruptive -- it &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years of evolution .
and i argued that we may be able to create a new form of the chambrian explosion in which there may be massive new species based on this digital design .
why should we do that ?
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
we are six billion to nine billion people in the next 40 years .
to put it in my context : i was born in 1946 .
today , three people on this planet are in 1946 ; within 40 years , it will be four .
we have problems with food , with fresh and clean water , medicine , fuel for 6.5 billion people .
it becomes a challenge for nine offer .
we need about five billion tons of coal , 30-plus billions of barrels of oil -- that &apos;s a hundred million barrels a day .
if we think about biological processes or any process to replace it , it will be a huge challenge .
then , of course , there &apos;s all the co2 from this material in the atmosphere .
we have now , from our discoveries around the world , a database of about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the design components of the future .
the electric industry had a dozen components , and you see the diversity of it .
we &apos;re first hitting the limits of biological reality and to those of our ideas .
we have technology today because of this fast accelerated technology , to do what we call combined genetics .
we now have the ability to build a large robot that can make millions of chromosomes a day .
if you think about these 20 million different genes , or to optimize these processes to make octopus or drugs new vaccines , we can change more molecular biology than the last 20 years of science .
and it &apos;s just unprecedented selection . we can selefy to life , production from chemicals or fuel production and so on .
this is a shot of active design software that we &apos;re working on , which is actually going to sit down and design new species on the computer .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know how it &apos;s going to look . we know exactly how their genetic code is going to look .
we &apos;re now focusing on leaks of the fourth generation .
you &apos;ve seen corn ethanol recently , which is a bad experiment .
we have leaven of the two-year and third generation that will come out pretty soon the amount of sugar are going to be a lot higher , like octopus or different kinds of butanol .
but , as we think the only way that we think about biology is a big impact without any other increase of the cost of food , or the limitation of their availability , if we look at co2 , and therefore we work on cells that go away .
and we think that we will be the first with leaven of the fourth generation , and that &apos;s about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
but in our discovery of the world , we have all sorts of different ways .
this is an organism we described in 1996 .
he lives in the deep sea , about one-and-a-half miles deep , in almost cooking water temperatures .
it changes co2 in methane by the use of hydrogen energy .
we can study that we can use carbon co2 , which could just be brought into production , converting the co2 in fuel , to make this process .
within a short period of time , we think we could be able to solve one of the fundamental questions of life .
you know , we have really -- moderate goals like the diet of the entire petrochemical industry , and if you can &apos;t do that at ted , where else ?
but what we &apos;re doing right now is to use the same approaches to the development of vaccine vaccine .
they &apos;ve seen it this year with flu , we &apos;re always on the back , and we have a dollar for a year when it comes to the right vaccine .
i think that this can be changed by creating reforming vaccines in the pre-front .
this is what the future might look like with changes , can be accelerated today with synthetic bacteria , archaen , and perhaps eukaryonites .
we &apos;re going to make some light light away from people , and our goal is that we have a chance to survive long enough to do that . thank you very much .
on the last ted conference , i gave a introduction to the lhc .
and i promised to come back to explain how the machine works .
so it &apos;s as though . and for all those of you who weren &apos;t there , the lhc is the biggest scientific experiment that has ever been addressed -- 27 miles in diameter .
his job is to create the conditions that exist less than a billionth of a second of the universe -- and to 600 million times in a second .
it &apos;s just breathambitious .
this is the machine below gene .
we take images of this mini big bang .
i work on this work . he calls atlas detector -- 44 meters in the thick , 22 feet in diameter .
here &apos;s a spectacular picture of the atlas in the construction so that you see the scale .
on september 10th last year , the machine went to the first time .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
it caused huge juunds in the control room .
it &apos;s a picture of the first piece of radiation , which is the whole way to put the lhc back to the lhc , and then to make a part of the lhc , to make an rain of particles on the detector .
in other words , when we saw this picture on september 10th , we knew that the machine works , which is a great triumph .
i don &apos;t know if this did , or this , when someone went to the google side , and that was the starting page .
it means we reached a cultural impact next to scientific .
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine to do with these wires here -- this golden wires here .
these wires are burning 13-1,000 when the machine goes on high-performance .
well , the engineers are going to look at you and say , &quot; no , don &apos;t do that . these are little wires . &quot;
you can afford that because if you &apos;re very cool , you &apos;re going to be called a supercomputer .
so at minus 271 degrees , as the space between the stars , these wires can get tension .
in one of the connections , between over a thousand magnets in the lhc , there was a negotiation defect .
so , it opens up the wires at the very top , and 13-1,000 and a thousand and a thousand .
this was the result .
now , this is even more exciting when you imagine that the magnet weigh over 20 tons and around 30 inches .
so we damaged about 50 of the magnets .
and they had to remove what we did .
we measured them , repair them .
they &apos;re all back on their way back .
by the end of march , the lhc will be refunctional .
we &apos;re going to turn it to , and expect first data in june or july , and we can collect our journey to figure out what the building blocks of the universe are .
now , of course , in a way that accidents like this , again , the debate is about the value of science and engineering . it &apos;s easy to dismiss .
i think the fact that it &apos;s so hard that we reach beyond our limitations , the value of things like the lhc .
i &apos;m going to leave you with words of an english scientist , and humphrey davy , who i suspect , as he defended the most expensive experiments of his teaching fund , was michael faraday , who said , &quot; there &apos;s no mystery in nature that we have no new worlds . &quot;
thank you .
i &apos;m a writer .
writing books is my job , but of course it &apos;s more than that .
it &apos;s also my big , life-long love and fascination .
and i don &apos;t expect that to change that .
however , a little bit more recent in my life , and my career has happened to rethink my relationship with this work completely .
this strange event was that i was writing a book recently -- a biography called a lone , disruptive , love -- that decided to be different than all my previous books out of some of the previous books in the world , and a big mega-event .
the result is that , no matter where i &apos;m going to come from , i &apos;ll be treated as being the dawn .
seriously -- the dawn !
for example , you get very worried about me and say , &quot; don &apos;t you fear you will never meet that success ?
don &apos;t you fear that you &apos;re going to write your whole life and never create a book that &apos;s going to be anyone in the world ? never again ?
okay , it really does courage .
but it would be worse if i didn &apos;t remember that i was in front of 20 years ago when i first told him that i wanted to be a writer for the first time , that i had been faced with the same kind of fear of anxiety .
people said , do you have no fear , never succeed ?
do you have no fear that the humiliation of an excuse ?
do you have no fear that you &apos;re going to go to your life for your life and never come out of it , and you &apos;re going to die on a rub in front of your mouth -- filled with your mouth with the slippery ads ?
so , you know , you know .
the answer -- the short answer to all these questions : biotech .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all of these things .
and i always had .
and i &apos;m afraid a lot more things that no one would ever get .
as algae -- and other fearless things .
but if it &apos;s about writing , i &apos;ve been thinking about it , and i ask myself , why ?
is that reasonable ?
is it logical that it should be expected by someone that he &apos;s afraid to do the work he feels ?
and what &apos;s going on with the creative enterprise that they make us insecure about the mutual state -- in a way that other professions don &apos;t do ?
my father , for example , was chemist and i can &apos;t remember any situation in his 40 years when he was asked whether he was afraid to be chemist .
with your chemict block , john -- how do you do it ?
it just didn &apos;t come before , you know ?
but to be fair -- the group of chemists don &apos;t have a reputation of the centuries of alcohaaddice , people .
we seem to have these kinds of calls , but not just the writers , but not only have the writers , but they seem to be mentally unstable to be mentally unstable .
everything you need to do is to look at the bitter death numbers of really amazing heads from the 20th century who died young and often by your hand .
and even those who don &apos;t actually have parkinson &apos;s research seemed to be neglected by their peers .
norman mahl : before his death in his last interview , a bit of my books had killed me a little bit further .
an extraordinary statement that you can do about your life .
but we don &apos;t even think if we hear somebody like this , because we &apos;ve known these kinds of statements as long as that long , we kind of have the idea of internals and collective accepted that creativity and suffering , of course , leads and that art -- at the end -- always leads to the lake .
the question i want to ask everybody here is : is this an idea for you all right ?
do you feel like that ? because with just one centimeter , i don &apos;t feel at all .
i find them .
and i think it &apos;s dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to watch how it &apos;s taken into the next century .
i find it better if we were to live our great creative encouraging .
and i definitely know that it was for me -- in my situation -- very dangerous , starting to look at this dark path in the sense of opinion -- particularly the fact that i &apos;m in my career .
that means -- look : i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m just about 40 years old .
i may have another 40 years of work .
and it &apos;s extremely likely that everything i &apos;m going to write from now is from the world than the work of my last book , right ?
i &apos;ll tell you straight because we &apos;re all kind of friends here -- it &apos;s highly likely that my biggest success is behind me .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
these are the kind of thoughts that someone can get to start to drink nine o &apos;clock in the morning , and i don &apos;t want to .
i would rather continue to do this work that i love .
so the question is , how ?
after some time of the reflection seems to me that i have to continue to write a kind of protective psychological construct .
so , somehow , i have to find a way to actually find a safe distance between me and my very natural dissect about how the reaction is going to be .
while i was looking for models in the last year to do that , i was also looking for the past , and i tried to find other societies to see if they might have better or rational ideas about how to deal with creativity .
this search led me to the old greece and the old rome .
please follow me , because the circle will end up again .
but in the old greece and rome , people don &apos;t believe that creativity comes from people , ok ?
they believed that creativity was a kind of divinative spirit that comes out of a distant , unknown source to the people -- from unexplanating , unknown reasons .
the greeks called these divine diaries of creativity of creativity .
from socrates is known that he believed he would have a monmon who gave him back from further distance .
the roman one had the same idea , called this kind of body of body &apos;s creative mind .
this is great . the roman thought wasn &apos;t really that a genius was a particularly brilliant individual .
they believed that a genius was this kind of magical divine creature , which was believed that it literally lives in the walls of an artist -- about like dobby , the janitages -- that would come out and design the artist &apos;s work in a way .
this is brilliant -- it &apos;s because there &apos;s a distance that i talked about -- the psychological construct , which protect you from the effects of your work .
and everybody knew that it worked , right ?
the artist of aging was protected by some things , like , for example , too much narcisissm , right ?
if your work was brilliant , you don &apos;t look at everything for you . everybody knew you had this body genius that helped you .
if your work went out -- not completely your fault , right ?
everybody knew it was a little laugh .
so the people in the west really have thought about creativity .
and then the renaissance and everything changed . we had this big idea , and this big idea was : let &apos;s put the human individual in the center of the universe -- all the gods and mystery . and there &apos;s no room for mystical creatures that are tracking orders of divinity .
it &apos;s the beginning of rational humanism and people started believing that creativity came completely from their own individual .
for the first time in history , you hear people call this or some of those artists a genius -- instead of being a genius .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
you know ? i think a blog person allows him to think he &apos;s or she &apos;s like the redwood basin , and the essence and the source of all divine , creative , infinite , infinite , unfamiliar , human psyche .
it &apos;s like asking someone to swallow the sun .
and it turns out to be distorted egos and it creates all these unexisting expectations to success .
i think this success pressure has wiped our artists out of the last 500 years .
and if that &apos;s true , and i think it &apos;s true -- is the question .
can we change it ?
maybe an aging understanding of the relationship between people and the mystery of the creative return .
maybe not .
maybe we can &apos;t do that well from 500 years of humanism in a traditional minute talk .
and there &apos;s certainly people in this audience who would really overmark scientific doubt about the notion of -- basically -- feen , the people who follow people and the magic magic on their projects .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey .
but the question i want to leave is , why not ?
why not think about it ?
because it makes a lot of sense like anything else that i &apos;ve heard about when it was about explaining the absolutely crazy capine of the creative process .
a process that -- like everybody knows it &apos;s ever trying to do something -- so in other words , everybody here -- not always practical .
in fact , he can feel really accurate sometimes .
i had met a close encounter recently when i met the extraordinary american dicin ruth stone , which is now over 90 , but she told me that she was going to work on the fields for her entire life . she said she was going to feel and hear a poem about the landscape on her .
she said it would be like a basernder .
the country would roll on her .
she felt if it came , because it would get the earth under your feet .
she knew that she was able to do a moment in such a moment , and that was -- -- in her words -- , in her words , the deviatory race .
they ran like the devil to the house while they were tracking by this poem , and it was just that they had to go fast enough to a sheet of paper and a pencil so they could capture it when it was through them .
in other words , she wasn &apos;t fast enough ; she ran and ran and ran , but she didn &apos;t run the house and the poem were rolling through her , and she said it was going to go through the country , and she said , &quot; you &apos;re going to go for a different poet . &quot;
and then there was these moments -- the part i will never forget -- she said that there was eye looking at it .
so she goes to the house , and he looks for the paper , and the poem goes through it , and she grabs a pen as it goes through her and then -- she said -- it was as if she was going to pick up with her other hand after that , and he said to it .
she caught the poem on his tail and pulled it back into her body and took it on paper paper .
in those opportunities , the poem came up and intact and intact on the paper -- but in the last word to the first .
when i heard that , i thought that this is incredibly -- that &apos;s what my creative process is going on .
it &apos;s not like my creative process -- i &apos;m not the canal .
i &apos;m a mab . i need to get up to work every day , and i &apos;ve got to get up to the same time every day and really unveil me .
but even i have this thing in my mouth , sometimes this thing .
and i guess many of you have done that too .
even i had been working or ideas that came from a source of a source that i really couldn &apos;t identify .
what is this thing ?
and how do we get in relationship without losing our minds , but to keep ourselves in the opposite of intellectual health ?
for me , the best living example is how to create this , the musicians tom wakey . i was allowed to interview him a few years ago .
we talked about this issue , and you know what ? most of his life was tom &apos;s embodiment , who tried to do this uncontrolled creativity of the modern artist that was trying to get into him and with them .
but then he became older and quiet . he told me that one day he went on a faster street in los angeles , and it changed everything for him .
he was driving with high speed as he suddenly sounds a little fragment of a tune , which , as it was in inspiration , is very difficult for him , and he wants it . she &apos;s prabling , but he can &apos;t touch it .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a pen ; he doesn &apos;t have a cassejet recorder .
so he starts out , these old beclipes in him , like i &apos;m going to lose this thing , and i &apos;ll be rejected by this song forever .
i &apos;m not good enough , i don &apos;t make it .
but instead of getting into panic , he just listened .
he finished the whole thought and did something completely new .
he just looked at the sky and said , &quot; biotech , can &apos;t you see me drive ? &quot;
so , do i look like i could just write a song ?
if you really want to exist , come back to a cheap moment when i can take care of you .
if not , any other way today .
go and qurooms leonard cohen .
his whole process process has changed .
not the work itself . it was often as dark as it did .
but the process and the heavy batch that surrounds him was when he made the genius out of it , where he had nothing to be in trouble , and then let him go back to where he came from . he realized that it had to be an internent thing .
it could give an owner , miraculous , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and the stranger , which wasn &apos;t exactly tom .
as i heard this story , it also changed a little bit of the way i worked and it has been saved .
this idea saved me when i was in the middle of the writing process in the middle of the bookstore , clone , love . i fell in one of these two of the two rock that we all fall when we work on something and it doesn &apos;t work . you start thinking that it &apos;s going to become a disaster .
not just bad , but the worst of all time .
i started thinking , i should just get into the project .
but then i remembered how tom had spoken in the sky , and i tried it .
so i raised my view of the manuscript , and i talked to my comment about an empty corner of the room .
i talked loudly , you know , you know , you know , you know , you and i , you know , if this book isn &apos;t brilliant , it &apos;s not completely my fault , right ?
because you see that i have everything i have , investment . i don &apos;t have more than that .
so if you want to have better , you &apos;ve got to check up here and keep your share of your weight .
okay . but , if you don &apos;t do that -- you know what , then the hell .
i &apos;m still going to write , because that &apos;s my job .
and i &apos;d like to give you that i was here today for my part of the jobs .
because ... at the end of it , it &apos;s like the following . centuries ago , in the deserts of north north america , people have collapsed to sunmen , with sacred dancers and music that has been rejected -- until the murder .
these strong were always great , because the dancers were professional and they were fantastic .
but again , very rarely , something special happened . one of the darer was actually overdated .
and i know that you know what i mean , because i know you &apos;ve all seen one such performance in your life .
it was when the time was still , and the dancers were coming through a kind of poute , and he did not do anything different than he ever did before -- 1,000 nights before .
and all of a sudden he didn &apos;t get more human .
he was illuminated by the inside , and from the bottom , and everything lit up through a divine fire .
as something happened then , people knew what that was . they called it in his name .
they put their hands together and they started singing : biotech lah , allah , allah , god , god , god .
that &apos;s god , you know ?
interesting historical footnote : when the mobes brought in southern spain , they brought this practice . the language changed over the centuries of the centuries of the centuries , allah , allah , olé , olé , olé , olé .
if a real script in spain did something impossible , a little bit of a magical thing : biotech lah , olé , olé , allah , great , brown , bravo . there &apos;s a glimpse of god .
and that &apos;s great , because we need it .
but , the tricky part follows the next morning , when the dancers fell up , and he recognizes that it &apos;s 11 o &apos;clock at a tuesday -- and he &apos;s no longer wearing god .
it &apos;s just an aging immune system , and maybe it will never come back to those ages .
and maybe again , someone will call god &apos;s name , but what does he do with the rest of his life ?
that &apos;s hard .
this is one of the most painful correctness of a creative life .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so full of pa if you didn &apos;t believe that the most extraordinary aspects of your existence came from you .
if you may only believe that you &apos;re a hot driver -- from an unimaginable source of your life , which is passed on someone else , if you &apos;re done with it .
when we start thinking about it , it changes everything .
so i started thinking , and i think with safety in the last few months , while i was working on the book , which is soon going to be -- when the dangerous , frightening , spontaneous , very likely to address my fault .
what i &apos;ve got to say constantly , if i &apos;m going crazy , is : have no fear .
isn &apos;t it .
just make your job .
it &apos;s still for your contribution , whatever it is .
if your job is dancing , dance .
if the dumb divine genius you put on the side is , choose to show a short moment of wonder by your effort , then , you know , do a little bit of wonder by your effort .
and if not , yet , your dance .
and minimolé ! for you despite all of that .
i believe and i feel that we should teach that .
legaolé ! customization for you , just for the fact that you just have the human love and your own sense of being there .
thank you .
thank you .
olé !
last year , i showed these two slides to illustrate that the arctic ice cream , which had been the size of the lower 48 million years to beat 40 percent .
but this doesn &apos;t push strong enough the seriousness of this particular problem because it doesn &apos;t show the thickness of the ice .
in a certain sense , the arctic ice app is the beating heart of our global climate system .
she grows in the winter of the winter .
the next slide i &apos;m showing you is a time-lapse shot of what happened over the last 25 years .
the permanent ice is with red .
as you can see , it builds up on the dark blue , and this is the annual ice ice in winter ; and it picks up in summer .
it &apos;s called permanent ice , five years old or older , almost like blood , which is out of the body .
in 25 years , it &apos;s going to be gone here .
this is a problem because the warming is the frozen bottom of the arctic ocean , where there are large amounts of frozen carbon , which , if it &apos;s restoring , it &apos;s implemented by microbes to methane .
compared to the whole amount of climate change in the atmosphere , this amount could double if we cross this critical point .
already , in some flat lakes in alaska from itself from the water .
professor katey walter &apos;s university was traveled to alaska with another flat group of labor last winter .
wow !
it &apos;s good . the question is , how is it going to be ?
and one reason is that this enormous heat bird is warmer from the north .
this is a six-year river .
but the volume is much bigger than ever before .
this is the canary river river in southern west .
if you want to know how the sea level goes up through land ice over here , you &apos;re going into the sea .
these rivers take rapid .
on the other end of the planet , antarctica , the biggest ice mass on the planet .
last month of melled researchers , the entire continent now has a negative iceberg .
and the west antarctica , which came across a few underwater islands , is particularly strong in the melt .
it &apos;s 20 feet of sea altitude , like greenland .
in the himalayas , the third largest iceberg , you see the new lakes that were a few years ago .
40 percent of all the people around the world get half their food water from this melting water .
in the netherlands , this glacier is the drinking water source for this city .
water levels have expanded .
but if you run out , most of the water will fall away .
in california , a 40 percent reduction reduction of the sierra orn .
this is the memory basin .
and the predictions of how they read them are serious .
all around the world , it leads to a dramatic increase in fire .
and the disasters all over the world have given up in a really extraordinary and not before .
four times in the previous 30 years in the previous 30 years .
this is a completely crude pattern .
if you look at this in the historical context , you can see what it does .
in the last five years , we have 70 million tons of co2 produced every 24 hours -- 25 million tons every day in the oceans .
look at the area of the eastern pacific in the right place , from the american continent , of west subcontinent , where there is a dramatic decline in the ocean .
the biggest factor for global warming , besides deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the burning of fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the biggest problem .
the united states is one of the largest polluted , together with china .
and the proposal was to build a lot of other coal factories .
but we start to see a change .
here are the ones who have been executed in the last few years , with some green alternatives that have been proposed .
there &apos;s a political argument in our country .
and the cohls and the ostris have spent a quarter of a billion dollars in the last year to put clean coal , which is a contradiction in itself .
this picture reminded me something .
in order to go around christmas , at home in tennessee , a billion tons of cohlpers .
you saw it in the news .
this is in our country &apos;s largest largest waste river of america .
this was about christmas .
one of the commercials of cohlan industry was at christmas .
frosty the carbon is a delight , happy burc .
there is in skin and abundance in america , and he helps to grow our economy .
frosty , the chocolate gets clean every day .
he &apos;s affordable , and he &apos;s worth it , and he will stay in lohn and bread .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
the most powerful mountain workers is the chief of massey camp.
let me say a very clear one . al gore , nancy sacks , harry plaosi , you don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
so the alliance of climate protection is called two campaigns in life .
this is one , a part of her .
in the coalergia , we see climate change as a serious threat for our business .
so we put it on the top stage , a significant amount of money to get an ad action on the way to get the truth about coal .
in fact , coal is not dirty .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it doesn &apos;t smell yet .
so , don &apos;t worry about the climate change .
let &apos;s take that quiet .
saudi coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
so let &apos;s make a tour of this modern , clean carbon factory .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty loud .
but it &apos;s the sound of the clean carbon technology .
and yet the burning of coal is one of the main reasons for global warming , which you see here , changes everything .
look at it right now , this is the current , clean carbon technology .
finally , the positive alternative with our economic challenge and our challenge of national security .
america is in a crisis , the economy , the national security , the climate crisis .
the red string , which connects all of these together , is our dependence of carbon fuels like dirty coal and foreign oil .
but now there &apos;s a bold , new solution to free us out of this .
funding america with 100 percent clean electricity in the next 10 years .
a plan of bringing america back to work is to make us safer and help stop global warming .
finally , one solution is big enough to solve our problems .
values are new . find more .
this is the last .
it &apos;s about a new supply of america .
one of the fastest ways , our addiction of ancient , dirty power materials that are enriching our world .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
new investment , to do good paying jobs .
funding america is new . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
there &apos;s an old african saying , &quot; if you want to be quick , go alone .
if you want to get far , come together . &quot;
we have to get far , very quickly .
thank you .
i want to start asking you to think of the time of your childhood , when you were playing with construction .
as you realized how to raise your hands and reach out the blade of hands and move it , you actually learned to think about the problems and changing the space of space .
the spatial thinking is closely connected to how we understand a lot of our environment .
as a computer scientist -- inspired by the kind of interaction of our interaction with real objects -- with my professional advisers and my colleagues , jeevan kalanithi , i started to wonder : what if we were going to use computers , which is moving as a digital fingerp , and you could take that data physically , how we want it ?
this question was that we decided that we had decided to explore the answer and sithers .
in short , a sicer is an interactive computer in the size of a cookie .
you can move with your hand , you can see each other , they can detect their movements and they have a screen and a radio receiver .
much more important : are physically important , so you &apos;re just like construction , you can get them out through the grasp of hands and access .
and the sivers are an example of a new generation of aid to manipulation of digital data .
and when these tools become more powerful , and you can develop consciousness for your movements , you see each other , and you can see the enemies of our trajectory with them , and we can start with the study of new and entertaining interaction types .
i start with some simple examples .
this is a sicer for the video refigurations , and if i put it in a direction , the video will move forward ; if i put it in the other direction , it runs backwards .
and these interactive portraits take each other right .
so if i put them side-by-side , they get interest .
if you &apos;re very , very immersed around , you &apos;ll notice that and you can get something nervous .
and they &apos;re also feeling their movements .
an interesting consequence of the interactions that we started to see was that we could apply everyday gestures on data like color , as you can do with fluid .
in this case , we have three sivers as a color configuring and i can use them to pour color in the middle of the middle where they &apos;re going to mix .
if we overtake it , we can go back a little bit .
there are also some pretty good opportunities in education in how languages , math or logically , where we give people the possibility of fast trial and the results immediately want to see .
here i am -- this is a fibonacci series that i do with a simple kind of program .
this is a game with words , which is a kind of mixture of scrabble and boggle .
basically , you get every round of sivers at random random letters , and as you try to form words , these over a dictionary will be tested .
then , after about 30 seconds , again , remixed and you have a new letter combination and new possibilities to try and test .
thank you .
these are some kids who came up to the media lab , and i could move them to try and do it , and i took a video of it .
they really loved it .
an interesting fact about this kind of application is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
all you have to say is &quot; form words , &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
here are some people who test it .
this is our youngest at the bottom right there .
it turns out he wanted to just stack the sives .
so they were just construction .
this is an interactive antenna .
we wanted to develop a support for language learning .
this is felix .
he can bring new characters into the scene by shipping the sicer from the table , which shows this character .
here he leaves the sun .
the sun goes up .
now he pulls a tractor into the scene .
the orange tractor .
good work ! yes !
by shaking the siks , and you can get the characters to be able to interact ...
... his own story .
hello !
it &apos;s a story with open end and it can decide how they evolved .
flying cat .
the last example i have today is to show it , it &apos;s a musician sequencing for live performances that we &apos;ve developed recently , and in the sicer experience as a sound voice , as leadership , bass and striving stuff .
each one has four different variations ; you can choose what you want to use .
and you can take these notes into the sequence that you can put into certain patterns .
and you &apos;re wearing them by simply holding a sound of sound to a probe .
there are effects that you can change live , like hall and filters .
you connect it to a certain note and it tends to be a set .
and then even more mature effects like speed and yellow power that you use on the whole sequence .
so let &apos;s see .
we start in which we can eat the leadership in two sequencing , and then put them in a row , they expand and add a little bit more the voice .
now i add a bass .
now i &apos;m going to do something about it .
and now i put the filter with the slide , so i can steer the effect live .
i can speed up the whole sequence by throwing the pace into one or another direction .
and now i add the filter to the bass , for something more expression .
i can turn the sequence into it .
so , i don &apos;t have to plan it in the field , but can improvise ; it &apos;s going to give you a fold , or you can .
and finally , i can disclose the whole sequence by running the sound open to the left .
thank you .
so , as you can see , my desire to develop new computer computer stations that are better to fit how our brains and bodies work .
and today i had time to give you a part of this new design world and some of the possibilities that we &apos;re working on in our lab .
the idea that i want to give you on the path is that we are at the threshold of this new generation of value to interaction with digital media , bringing information to our demands .
thank you .
i &apos;m delighted to talk to you all .
yeah , good afternoon .
i &apos;m glad i &apos;m there .
so , what is biohacking ?
i just have to get a little bit out of it , and that &apos;s biohacking with the modern molecular biology .
i &apos;m studying molecular biology , and i &apos;ve been doing molecular hacking now for a few years with the biohacking , and i started , because i just wanted to know , and i wanted to do what i learned in this .
so , that was my primary motivation .
so it was a curiosity , and i wanted to sort of get closer to the matter of the matter .
i think the molecular biology in general now is speaking , so in general , biotechnology , everything you count , synthetic biology and so forth .
extremely important , now it &apos;s extremely important , and much more important will become in the future .
there are so controversial things that are changing all the genetic plants in the u.s.
now , there is craig venter in the united states trying to make biofuels , so fuel from algae .
and then there are also things that are completely in the everyday life , which are most of the people who are not aware of what most people are allowing , for example , with four degrees of laundry , are also genetically optimistic enzymes .
and the list can continue .
and so from the interest that this technology , i just kept on there .
so why now ?
most people know that from the software domain .
computers hack , and then it &apos;s going to break into the media , yes , the hackers break up somewhere , and claws and so on .
it &apos;s kind of very sad for the hacking scene , because that &apos;s not what they &apos;re actually starting to do , and what &apos;s actually behind it .
and the software hacker , in the seventh , started with computer construction , and it &apos;s also created the internet .
and it &apos;s about a playful , creative , original way of solving a problem .
and problem , that &apos;s not just a technical problem , it can be a social problem , it can be just a problem problem , which is how things simplify things , which is a question , and how you can make it better or how you can do it differently .
and it &apos;s got to have software with software , but there &apos;s also one in the cloud of electronics , there &apos;s also a whole built-in scene that makes all kinds of stuff with electronics .
and now , in the direction of biology , and i want this metaphor to come out of synthetic biology , that biology is actually an information science , because the d.n.a code is an abstract code , because it &apos;s a matter of matter , and not just cyber .
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can also program it , and you can also hack it , so , and that &apos;s what i found incredibly fascinating , and i just wanted to get a lot deeper with it .
it &apos;s actually just a thousand , eight thousand really form , these networks .
there &apos;s hackers , and there &apos;s a hacking dot org , which is originally from switzerland , which is with europe and with cooperation in india , but now members or active people around the world .
this is a more artistic impact , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers , and working with scientists with these technologies , just with these technologies , and to process the creative , because there &apos;s museum exhibitions and yes , all possible .
but it &apos;s always about finding a kind of cury access to the way that you have a kind of rigid access to it .
and then there is do-it-yourself organic dot org , d.i.y.bio .
this is from the united states a network that &apos;s actually sort of like a kind of forum where you &apos;re coming and discussing online .
they &apos;re a little bit more technical , and also a little bit of business on the way , because they &apos;re also asking questions .
and based on these networks that made the whole popular thing , a scene that i &apos;d like to talk about quickly .
here in the picture on the left , you see biographically , which is a hackerspace , so basically a kind of school , a private school , a personal institution , where everyone can come .
kids , old , all kinds of people go to it , just to put them together , they have a lab and look at what you can do when these lab reports look at .
here &apos;s a group on the left at the bottom of the left , house-cent of atoms , which is that there &apos;s already quite a long time .
already longer than those other two networks .
they &apos;re also involved in such an artistic aspect with biological materials and , yes , electric builders , and combine that kind of stuff .
a group of ankara , which i &apos;ve met a while ago , which is a student group that would like to take the public to the public , what they learn to learn in college , and they &apos;ve tried to explain what d.n.a is .
and i have a lecture on the top of the picture in copenhagen in the medical museum in a combination of a medical show .
and this is , yes , that &apos;s mostly quite a young people , but the only thing that all americans are , is this fascination on technology .
and what you can do with it , and you &apos;re also looking at the society , and you &apos;re wondering , okay , what do you know what you &apos;re going to do , your interest in it ?
so , in order to hack biology now , you kind of need material .
you need biological materials , of course , but you need tools , and that &apos;s a lab .
in fact , what you normally understand under a lab that &apos;s kind of bothered machines , extremely expensive , very expensive , just for professional employees , just to be educated , and so on .
and our approach was to say , okay , in fact , you don &apos;t have to do that .
this is actually not necessary because every every store has actually increased technology as most lab devices , which is really so .
and then with this premise with this premise with this premise , for example , brian degger , in england , tried to provide a minimally .
so every one of the time , you know , a soup of soup that he had left too long , even did .
i was trying to do this in my lab at home a little bit , and then i went to buy so much of hand equipment on ebay , and i made a little d.n.a analysis , trying to make a dad test .
now that shouldn &apos;t be a joke , actually .
here in the picture , you see this in the lab , it &apos;s the lab , so it &apos;s such a comdetermined garage with so much of the lab , the university of college , which has a group in paris , which has a group in paris , and i also want a project for a long time .
and this is biographically , which is also mentioned hacking space , this one , as a kind of enshochschool in principle for molecular biology .
and yes , so , you see , it &apos;s relatively relative , so there &apos;s a lot of people doing that by their own home , so far up to large , so much bigger organizations that are going to have more formalized in institutional form .
but always the approach that it &apos;s going to stop and be accessible .
the first project we &apos;ve done as an international group , as we &apos;ve been aware of our own selves , and we &apos;re here now as a real scene , and we &apos;re all over here , and we know the people that are getting there and so on .
and then came from the do-it-yourself organic bioorg website , and he said to the founder of the founder , we &apos;ve got to really meet us now , also real meetings , and then we have two events , in a two-thousand , and shortly after that , in san francisco .
and then , because it &apos;s also about , yes , who are we , what do we want , what do we want to say ?
and what are our values and what is our target , our foundation ?
and then we &apos;ve been working on a code-jet radius .
so that was quite intuitive , so everybody just has his wish , his and that , and what he &apos;s going to move , then , then .
there was a very good code in my opinion .
and we then have the one that we have , but that &apos;s because , you know , i think it &apos;s pretty good , that people are quite convinced about this .
and we even tried to bring it back into the academic world , but it &apos;s somehow not that way .
so i think we &apos;re in the biohacker scene , even a step further than the academic world .
now , what do we do for projects now ?
a project i did with the brazilian network in switzerland itself was that we wanted to build an optical trap or optical pipe .
this is when you focus a laser beam on a room , then you can capture little particles in the air , or in the liquid , and then move into this focus , which is , you know , like a tractor officer in principle .
this works really , this is done in academia , and we thought , in the academic aorc , we might have thought that we might have a webcam , and then we &apos;ve taken a webcam that &apos;s made the lens , the lens turns off , then you have a microscope that produces it .
this is what you see down there .
and then we put out a d.v.d brenner , and the burning would get out the laser and then try and focus on this camera .
and unfortunately , it didn &apos;t work , but we learned a lot yet .
so another project that comes from the french group of paris , which has been done , that &apos;s pretty cool .
and in fact , he has such a brain wave device , such a brain wave device or something like this , so he has been engaged with neurobiology , his nickname is sam neurohack .
he then has this helmet to get this helmet there , and in cooperation with the museum .
and then the visitors in the room could go into the room , sit down this helmet .
then their brain waves were measured , and depending on what they thought they thought or how they thought they were .
it was a pretty neat project .
another thing from the united states , which has just to do with this dad , is the p.c.r , which is the polymerase-response response , complicated word .
so it &apos;s about copying genes , to reproduce , to reproduce , fragments , questionouts , so you can make them visible .
so if i &apos;m going to do the profiler at the scene , then go back there , collect some hair samples , and then they &apos;re doing this kind of work , and then they can say , &quot; you know , that hair belongs to this man . &quot;
and the machines that are doing something like this are pretty expensive , which you buy , which is the cheapest thing to go to four dollars .
and that &apos;s not in hobbyspace , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that can also do a lot .
so this is just a use of many , which you can do with it .
and they &apos;ve been doing two builders , and they &apos;ve said that we &apos;re going to do easier and cheaper , and then we have open source , so free hardware , electric hardware , electric equipment , that this device is brought together , and now they have the cheapest vendes of these devices in the world .
i think somehow sixth dollars or something .
but anyway , it &apos;s still not cheap , but it &apos;s still not cheap , but it &apos;s in a frame where it &apos;s going to be available .
so i think it &apos;s a very clear hack .
a project i had started to build was a gene weapon .
gene weapon is , yes , like a kind of air print , it &apos;s about two inches or so .
you put d.n.a on gold particles , and the gold particles in these air bubbles , and then i shot it up and then made the light with it .
so the device you see there doesn &apos;t work .
but this is my prototype , but that &apos;s my prototype , which has looked like this , so on a branch that was on top of it , electronics and pressure , and that was the pressure too high , the thing was broken .
and then i took a string of sappese and it was attached to it .
one string of that , if you do the full of water with water , has enough pressure , so i think so close to six .
and then you can accelerate the particles strong enough , and then you can go into the onion .
and the commercial device costs about five thousand dollars , or something like that , the 50 .
so it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s essentially possible .
and this is the moment in which the core cause of the scene is to increase this availability of technology , and also increase the information and accountability that more people can get involved .
because , in the beginning , as i said , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have relatively little idea of it , and also no chance to make it really good .
because , if you just read about it , from semet literature , that &apos;s not the same thing as if you did or seen it .
and i think technology is becoming more important in our modern societies .
and if you want to meet , as an informed citizen , meaningful decisions in society , and you want to talk to them , you need access to knowledge and technology .
and you also have to do it and understand it and understand it .
and then the church is opening up , and the citizen science .
so , you know , as citizens , you &apos;re being able to bring back to these scientific technologies .
and this is the core cause of the biohacker .
these are the people who are at least exposed to at least on the website , d.i.y.organic website .
this is a relatively remarkable number of people worldwide .
and what &apos;s interesting is that they &apos;re also represented in southeast asia .
i think that &apos;s because there are fewer people who are there , as actually exist .
so i know about some who don &apos;t have it .
and these are just biohacker , individual people .
in part , also with these hacking spaces , this places combined .
and that &apos;s actually in the beginning .
as i said , you &apos;ve only figured it out .
and hacking spaces , so the computer hacking spaces , because the c-base in berlin was the first one , nine-hundred hundred .
and this is a giant network of very good , yes , infracenters that are represented throughout the world .
and what we hope , of course , is that we &apos;re also going to change ourselves , and we &apos;re also very well connected , so that there are more people involved .
and i would invite everybody to try to deal with it and even try and try and figure out what .
it &apos;s not that easy now , but it &apos;s not impossible if you &apos;ve got enough curiosity and put enough energy in , you get there too .
thank you for listening .
that &apos;s it .
yes , hello .
how do we actually work people ?
this is a question that i &apos;m very moved to as a designer , but also in the field of uspling , and in front of all things in the field .
it &apos;s about how to present people in an interactive media so that they can use these interactive media and create them as much as a satisfying experience .
because i believe that the interactive media in the us ancient , cognitive models address , so patterns that have been programmed in our biological memory are very , very long time ago , and that we can create the only way through interactive media .
and this is very amazing , because you actually believe that these high-technology , which you &apos;ve met , is that you &apos;re actually bringing one to the future , but in fact , the future is that the future is right at our own roots .
now , what are actually archaan models ?
i &apos;ve been writing four words , and i &apos;d like to just quickly explain .
to archaan cognitive models , this is the models that we have in the pre-industrial age .
to these archaan models , we have an underlying natural relationship to the virtual .
that sounds really unusual .
i &apos;m going to go back to this , and i &apos;m going to show you that you have a natural relationship to the virtual .
the second aspect is that we &apos;ve been able to be able to talk about this archaan models in the situation , even though we &apos;re using a mixed language today .
and the third area , which explains it by itself .
we all know that the interactive media is an definition of nonlinear , which includes the linearity of the linearity , and what tells us , of course , that we are now feeling the linearity today .
the fourth point is that the story for us is a place of information .
now , as it is with the virtual , which is actually the most natural thing in the world .
i want to show you that .
how many doors have the house you live in ?
that &apos;s not what we &apos;re going to answer to me immediately , but it &apos;s going to happen right now .
they go through this house , and they live in the spirit , and look at how many doors there are .
and that &apos;s what they do .
they &apos;re virtual the reality and the whole without computers .
fantastic , right ?
and we &apos;re worried about the median campus , for example , the virtual reality in our v.a.-lab , we can actually do the whole time .
and this wealth of this wealth is the virtual reality that has the reality of the people in the pre-industrial times , because they had nothing to do .
they didn &apos;t have books .
or they didn &apos;t have a photoligraphy .
they had no mass media .
the only thing that they had was her head .
and in this head , memory was happening .
in this mind , knowledge was called , and using this virtual imagery , imagination , has been passed on .
and therefore , it &apos;s so strong in us that we can deal with virtual so well .
the interesting thing is , if i can make a little trip .
yeah , that &apos;s going on .
the interesting thing about this is that at the same time the human media producer was , and medium itself .
now , if you think about it a little bit .
what are media today ?
then you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s a change .
but i &apos;m going to talk about it again .
the fundamental tool of information education has been by jection stories .
well , shaans , priests , called knowledge sales , were extra to maintain knowledge in stories .
and also today we &apos;re very , very strong at stories .
the author of the book called the tinkering , jonathan gotcheall , so we still came up with several hundred and a half hours with the reception of stories .
that means a child that has spent to reach the most of the time of his life with the reception of stories .
now , we think our love is about stories that we &apos;ve sat on the lap of our parents .
no , no , no .
this is a lot farther back to the cultures of the pre-industrial age .
but for me , in the field of interactive media , as a particularly impressive , is that we &apos;ve adapted on our biological memory .
i brought you an example of the north african tribe of the native indian tribe .
and life lived in the coastal region of british columbia .
and as you can see , this is a very island area and you had to kind of navigate , from iceland to iceland to get food .
and they did this with something called lead-land cards .
you may know that , if you &apos;re a little bit interested in it , from the australian archeties .
they have similar principles .
they don &apos;t have lead-land maps , but they &apos;ve used the kind of gene sonines , or they &apos;re joking too .
and what &apos;s interesting about this is that the navigation and the topography of regions could be taken over songs .
which is the language that the language was underrated .
that means you navisted about sound and rhythm .
and these sounds and this rhythm have the geology that shows the topography of a region , and , of course , it allowed you to reassemble these songs and go back to the corner and move back to the right place .
why don &apos;t we sing anymore to get from the top to b ?
anyway , not to navigate .
what &apos;s actually happening ?
this is the gene of gene &apos;s age .
we have moved to the so-called sea age .
this is the machine age , and it &apos;s happening the book , and it &apos;s the photoligraphy .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens is that we have the responsibility for our memories and the own production of our individual memories .
on the book , and on the image .
so unfortunately , we have a little bit of a luxury of god .
virtual openness has become alien for us , and has nothing to do with reality .
bruce brown , a well-known design researcher at brighton university , is so far to say that these mass media , he means the book , and the image , so not television , the internet and the ability to clean our memories .
let &apos;s make a small one .
from the vogt age to the machine age .
what has an impact on our thinking and our memory ?
and then this is the equivalent of subindustrial civilizations .
and they have been written over the course of the centuries , and more oversent by the forces of the machine age .
that is , instead of remembering us , we have standardized , far more common , in mass patterns of memories that we can depend on our personal memories .
we &apos;re not producing more ourselves .
we have an abstract language language .
we don &apos;t think about the things that are happening in pictures that are not in images , but we &apos;re coding to make them our language .
we used to be used to things linear .
and we have the linearity as a law , and there &apos;s only exceptions , like the non-linearity .
what &apos;s left us is this is the visceral .
still , we are very , very arrested as information information .
the question is , what &apos;s going on ?
we had the vosted age , we had the machine age and we were going to go to the so-called &quot; cyber age . &quot;
it sounds very space , and it sounds very large to science fiction , i know .
but these concepts of cyber age , which brings us back to these possibilities back to our capabilities .
there &apos;s virtual , it &apos;s about non-linearity , it &apos;s about visualizing .
i want to tell you a little bit about that .
there are technical concepts like the augmented reality , for example , which means the extended reality .
so , if you look at google , for example , if you look at google , then this is a concept of what the virtual world can combine with the real world , which means our affunity to the virtual , the virtual as something normal , is going to be addressed again .
another example is the so-called virtual reality .
so , of course , in the context of my talk , it may sound like this , because we &apos;re moving in unison , virtual worlds , all of the role of the hobby .
and other examples are the ambient , smart systems .
these are rooms that can respond to a human being .
all of this needs the ability to accept our basic ability to accept virtual habitat as a real habitat .
i was in conclusion , and i hope the video works , a very , very beautiful project brought that , which is the bachelorwork of michael burk , in cairo , joris delicious and jan-moritz .
and they &apos;re also here today .
maybe you can stand up a little bit , so you can go back and talk to the two about the project .
and i brought this project as an example of how to address this archaan , cognitive models .
this is a game i have to say .
which of course is extremely compelling and it &apos;s a computer game .
and when i say computer play , you have very likely to see that any people in front of you are people who are playing around , or they &apos;re playing with them with some kind of conventions in the hand .
anyway , they &apos;re doing that .
this is a game for outside .
and that &apos;s determined to say that i discover the world outside , so i discover the real world again .
and this game connects the virtual world , so the data is the data that we produce with the real world .
i apologize i gotta cut so much .
you can explain the same much better , because there &apos;s a lot more behind it .
and it &apos;s about the fact that i discover a city by looking at what the places are positive or the negative .
and so i get a whole different view of the city , a very different impression , which is , i see negative and positive zones of a city and getting a very different virtual map of a very real city .
and that &apos;s what we like to see now .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is another explanation of what you &apos;re looking at .
of course , this virtual world in the walls of our cities is clear .
and with a kind of paclight , we can make these virtual worlds visible .
so , i like to summarize my talk to my talk , in the sense that the properties and the skills that we &apos;ve acquired from the weather age , and we &apos;ve gotten a little bit more excited in the machine age , that we can actually get back back to our roots .
thank you .
yeah , i &apos;m very excited to be able to be with you .
i &apos;ve been asked if this bag is there , and i &apos;m talking about it instead of talking .
it won &apos;t do that .
i &apos;m also going to dissolve what there is .
but i &apos;ve just done it just as well .
yes , kids are from nature , or should be curious , designers too .
i &apos;m the age of house , so i &apos;m also , of course , with the theme of curiosity and how the curiosity is also changing again , and why we might lose curiosity and so on .
this is a whole range of things that you &apos;re looking at next to the actual experience of being .
if professors are curious , they &apos;re often thrown in so much of the research semester .
and that &apos;s what i had in the last half year .
a research curriculum in natural education interface design .
now , you &apos;re going to ask yourself why , you know , why are all the age of age with so natural , archaan urforms of communication , interaction and so on .
and because i just think of one of these little devices , because things are supposed to be more intuitive , more and more , always , more intuitive , user friendly , and you have to look at what &apos;s actually for us , of course , what is powerful or intuitively .
and before the background , i &apos;m in the area of natural user interface design , so the next generation in the treatment of the human computer , in the relationship of the human computer in the relationship of the computer , how our tools or how the computer is changing the computer .
so i &apos;ve been doing it when what is , of course , or intuitively .
maybe again , a look at it .
why does that happen ?
so if we look at the development of our society , this is just shown by the third , we &apos;re moving now from the third generation or social form .
so from modern in the computer society .
every society is shaped by the primary medium .
at the beginning , the tribal society through language .
that is , you &apos;ve found that you &apos;ve talked to a common language , you could communicate in the same cave , and in other parts , cities have formed , or villages , and has so created in society .
but the primary medium was the language , something very natural , something very natural .
you also had to learn , so no small child can talk about nature , but we learn it and of course .
it was then distributed by the ancient society and the first form of abstraction .
this was a huge outcry at the time , because , of course , the living language started to manifest in the form of writing , which means what fluid and everything is , i put it in stone and put it in stone , and i hated it .
depending on how i burst and when i fell , of course , it &apos;s a very different instruction than if there &apos;s a living kind of a living .
but sukzcal then moved this script as a primary medium , brought up .
then the next generation , in which we actually have primary life .
this is just by printing and printing writing with guberg and other .
at the time , it was just a kind of sacrifice , where adel , and other people said , are you really insane when the people start reading , then they want to talk , and that &apos;s really , of course , really fatal .
and now we get into the next generation , and the exciting one , such a general shift is just a few hundred years , and we &apos;re really in this phenomenal phase right now that we do this .
the confused of that , of course , is because we look at one side of the new media , pharmaceuticals social media , facebook usw and so on .
with total transparency , which is the new thinking , what the new thinking is , don &apos;t tell you that in the laser , horse meat and no beef is more or more different phenomena , which is i just want to do it and do it .
and these two worlds are all right now , new and old thinking .
the exciting thing about this is , if you look at this , these new society , these computer society , it &apos;s confined to very many mechanisms , principles and archaan patterns of the tribal society .
but no longer on the local level , but on a global scale .
we understood that the weather is global .
that the theme of ecology is global .
not , if i think locally , and the neighbor thinks less green , it doesn &apos;t work anymore .
that is , from the local village , a global village has become a global village with the same principles , of course , of course , but the total transparency .
as you knew at that time in the village , who has something to whom and when , this is what happens to us today , about this extension of ourselves through these mobile devices .
it &apos;s that we know global savanoes and faster and faster .
like it used to be on the village before .
in front of the background , i &apos;m just trying to look at what &apos;s called it , because what &apos;s going on for us , of course , what we might have , is what we might have , but what does the difference for us ?
because often people come , you can &apos;t make it friendly , so everyone can deal with it .
so you have to deal with what &apos;s called , and not just simply changing it , but it should be better .
and , of course , when it &apos;s a little bit intuitive , and how can i take care of it as an outage , and the things that are so important that they have a grat-in friendly , so that &apos;s what they &apos;re fun to do , because they &apos;re fun and just use it .
and then you &apos;ve been busy , even during the study , with the subject of perception and the perceptual website .
and , of course , that &apos;s what you &apos;re starting to start and look and look and say , okay , i just look at the inside .
and how does it actually look like there ?
so how do we work when we look inside ?
and what is actually , of course , intuitive and how does our channels of perception work , how does the cognitive process work ?
because steve jobs have said , you need to give you a ticket to have a lot of suspense .
so you really have to look at the details when i want to make something friendly or intuitively handable , which is called the core .
and you can see , you know , one of our seven senses , most of us , we have only five , right now , we &apos;ve seen seven , there &apos;s certainly seven , there &apos;s certainly going to be , in the near future , eight .
and look how we process information , how do we process information ?
to say , what is information ?
information is every difference that makes a difference .
many use the word , but don &apos;t know what it means .
but i have to understand in the core , in fact , when information is becoming information , when information information comes from information and information , so i know how to make things more intuitive or of course .
and of course , design shifts on perception .
we see this when i make things , and then i can make them confusing like on the right , where i don &apos;t know what &apos;s salt and pepper , or i can make them kind of intuitive , by showing things .
so a lot of natural , in a user , but i &apos;m sort of looking directly at where salt is and pepper .
and if i tell someone , give me salt , or pepper , then he will think about where &apos;s in it .
and then on the left just intuitively access , and then hopefully i hope that no sugar in it is the salt .
but also , our perception itself , as smells , is what it means .
for example , these perception in context .
the right circle looks taller than the little , even though it &apos;s not the case , but it &apos;s just the same size , and yet our perception , depending on what context we put in things .
does anybody know what that is ?
come on .
integratics should still work .
there &apos;s more to my glasses there .
so it &apos;s n circle .
a second circle is starting to correlate certain similarity or associate it .
and if i take a hold of halboval , we don &apos;t just look at one unit , which is a circle , circle and , but we don &apos;t see one unit , we see a circle , a circle , a circle .
this is what you call the law law or the state of psychology that also affects us in perception .
it &apos;s important for the lead , which is mostly in the first semester , the great law laws .
in law near , law laws of the continuity and so on .
so , in the third , again , forget about it .
but that &apos;s an essential part of the way , if you want to make things just equally intuitive .
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting , is the vision .
sounds very simple , but it sounds very upset when you get closer .
so we have the eyes , and now you think we &apos;re looking at the beginning .
that &apos;s wrong .
you can see from behind the back .
in fact , they &apos;re looking forward to an assumption that they can see what they can see , the way they can recognize .
that means we &apos;re just looking for our first ones before we see it in the back of our sehedevice , bringing it back to the back in order to say , okay .
i &apos;ve got cognitive back there , you have what you want to see .
and that &apos;s then , again , that comes back .
and then again , again , because the back doesn &apos;t go back to the front and say , right now , it really doesn &apos;t tell you if that &apos;s what you want to see .
and then it goes back to the back and then it &apos;s just seen .
so a very , very exciting process , as certain things happen , and what these things are going on .
i don &apos;t know who &apos;s familiar with this picture .
this is exactly what i &apos;ve described .
now , everybody &apos;s trying to see this pattern .
i don &apos;t know who sees what .
does anybody see some particular ?
a dalmatiner , right .
once i saw that , that there &apos;s a daldy in there , you know that .
you will never forget it anymore because i &apos;m going to show you where the itunes is .
now you see the itunes .
and further , now you see it .
that is , i &apos;ve actually been out of it now , that they don &apos;t recognize any pattern in the inside , but i &apos;ve been using it within a very short time , and again , again , to see this dog in this curved image .
and this is this projection of vision , feedback feedback .
now i know it , and now i &apos;m looking forward , i see the itunes .
i see the dalmatiner .
so , very exciting processes , which then , in this one , is probably not , but it &apos;s actually not , but here in this red mass .
does anybody know what three seconds are ?
long , yeah .
that &apos;s our present .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know than designers .
if i know something takes three seconds , until i kind of like the presence of the day in the previous loop , then i can actually have a very good wait for the past time , and i can do very well .
it has to process it as present .
and then it moves into the past , and so i can have a very elegant time for example on the computer , if i know this phenomenon .
what does five milliseconds seconds ?
yeah , milliseconds .
a very exciting phenomenon .
this is the time that you &apos;re in love with .
that means that if you know what you &apos;re looking at now , you pay attention to who you &apos;re looking at as long as i don &apos;t overpay for what can happen .
and six milliseconds , a very exciting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the time of most perceptions we have .
that is , this first impression is happening in a minute fast speed , as we perceive things .
and as we see things that we &apos;re looking at , what we &apos;re looking at as well as our environment , so we can think about it .
of course , it &apos;s not just about the subject of perception and neural processing or cognitive processing , but mainly of course with the subject of human objective relationship .
so , like a human being with certain things .
there &apos;s a product language that is practical , so that &apos;s the form of formal things or formaesthetic aspects .
there &apos;s a cartoon functions where i know exactly where i have to get .
but there &apos;s also symbolic functions , why is there anyone for such a small thing , where almost no matter what fit , so horror of money , even though it &apos;s not so practical ?
and we &apos;re more likely to be on the symbolic level , of course , with which we think of as the age of course .
back to my actual theme of natural user interface , and the theme of what is , of course , uspling is .
uspling means the way i can get a certain goal or how much a user can get in a certain benefit context , efficient and happiness .
that &apos;s what the norm says .
how can i make something more important ?
i can just use that right or i need a book , or i need to take care of it .
and less diagnostics or user friendly is it .
i &apos;m just making it different and beautiful , not that it &apos;s better .
you have to understand that .
and then , in part , if you look at the software that we &apos;ve just seen , then you will understand why ninety-nine percent of our software software is little intuitive or not based on what is a lot of intuitive , or not based on a lot of areas , even though it &apos;s much more intuitive .
it &apos;s not just an apple factor since apple has an essential economy , in the primary success factor , when i just want to make technological equipment for people .
why ?
because in the rule of this new kind of value , the natural users , for example , is five times the average of our goal .
you &apos;ve got to imagine that if you do something of classical sauce , five hours , and with this new kind of natural software , only one hour .
that doesn &apos;t mean that you &apos;re likely to be able to go home four hours to go home , but your employer or anyone will think of somebody as you can do with the four hours .
but i want to say that , of course , it &apos;s an accurate capacity for us to make certain things .
if we go back to the field of software , here &apos;s the first reline user interface that were very abstract , where you needed months to deal with these systems .
then the next , the right neural model , or the mental model , like the software eergonans say , is , you know , you have an idea of something that metaphor , the metaphor , to make the metaphor of a desktop .
so no longer zeros and ones , or flyptic codes , but a metaphor .
this was a lot more powerful , but it &apos;s also much better , of course .
the next generation of graphic user surfaces is working very much more with behavior .
so that &apos;s where i &apos;m making a lot of more expensive behavior than that .
this is also a paradigm shift .
i mean , at once , that &apos;s always unimportant to the success of the success , the right to the usature .
and if i take a step further into this natural user interface , where i agree with voice , by the language , by touch , by touch , by gesture , it &apos;s not about mouse and cursor , i &apos;m even more quickly .
but again , that leads me to the point , when the things are going to be more intuitive ?
if you become more intuitive , and then i have to turn back to my little friend here , and look at what does that mean because of the cognitive point of cognition , when is it really intuitive ?
and that &apos;s always a bit intuitive for us , if i have to think about it very little .
so he doesn &apos;t like to think , but it &apos;s going to be very simple .
the less i think about it , the more intuitive it is .
and what does that mean for designers ?
and that is , if we look at that we can transmit existing models of one on something else , for example , the metaphor , then i can do that as an instrument .
that means i can transmit an intuitive human model on a software and make the software more powerful .
now , of course , the question is , what is the most intuitive thing about people and now i &apos;ve been talking about it ?
this is what &apos;s called the leviathan model .
it uses every one of us and ozone is an acronym and stands for guidance , selective , evidence , transactions .
it makes any of you all the time , but it makes it unconsciously , and it &apos;s kind of intuitive or it &apos;s partly intuitive .
the model is already being stated in the womb and is interculturally , so it works in young and old , and it &apos;s used by us all the time , without that most people have known that this model is there .
it &apos;s going to be about 50 to 17 thousand times of us ever after activity , so in sleep , you &apos;ve found that it &apos;s going to be less frequently than the day .
now , i can model this mental model model , selective , evidence , transpairing on an interaction system .
and through this kind of transmission , similar to the metaphor of the desmissions , but not more a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a change , a cell leg .
and this is on a higher level of the user kindness as the transmission of a classic metaphor , which is the disposdriver .
and if i &apos;m wearing this now , for example that i &apos;m proposing as an outview , selecting as a choice , in the case , it comes up to me , and i can look at it in the details , and yes , i can throw it somewhere , or buy it , or buy it , or so on .
then i can transmit the whole thing .
i &apos;m trying to do this with an unprecedented one .
now , everyone has a cake .
the point is , i &apos;m sort of interacting with the object , again , zoom out , zoom out .
i &apos;m going to get the whole record , now , to filter and say , show me all the things with chocolate .
and once a interface , what &apos;s more intuitive and very much natural .
because , you know , because i can reach things like the bits , touch it , and you can come to me , is much more natural than if you think about hierarchically organized websites or other mechanisms .
imagination is more provider , and with this sentence , i want to close a and again , i want to close a and again , even designers have to think differently to come to new solutions , and thank you very much .
i want to help you a very specific aspect of curiosity .
the first thing you &apos;re going to do as a child , as a baby , is that it &apos;s going to take care of what makes you feel like that , right ? and depending on whether your parents have allowed them to play more or less , of course , the more curiosity , of course , .
and the curiosity can &apos;t learn .
that &apos;s why everybody &apos;s here , and are curious , in fact , people who have a property that you can &apos;t learn .
now , i &apos;m going to talk about this whole environmental discussion , the world set , four-and-a-half years club , in the quality of life .
and there &apos;s a central spot .
and it depends on phosphorus .
give up a chance .
every day , they give you scale about two grams of phosphorus , and every day you have to take two grams of phosphorus .
otherwise you can &apos;t have teeth .
you can &apos;t store energy .
you can &apos;t have bone .
we could only run out of the global ocean through the world .
if we did not actually take a phosphorus and push it .
it &apos;s amazing that we &apos;re dealing with something that &apos;s actually going on , but not that much .
because everyone talks about energy , but nobody talks about the phosphorus problem .
the phosphorus problem is much critical .
we depend on two countries .
we only have to get phosphorus for two years , and now we &apos;re going to have a lot more uranium in the world than being used in all nuclear plants .
in the last 20 years alone , five thousand pounds have been distributed on our fields in germany .
and that &apos;s what we take .
it makes leukemia in children .
and we think we would protect the environment if we &apos;re a little less harmful .
so , for example , the environment , less car .
step the environment , make less waste .
the environment , it takes less energy .
but that &apos;s not protection .
this is how if i would say , send your kid up , it &apos;s just three times five times .
this is just a little less destruction .
if we think about it from the 1950s to the bake , our whole earth used to be , or later , a peaceful park .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s about to think about .
and the most important thing is to look at the soil , first .
in the soil , over six percent of the carbon is stored .
right now , we &apos;re building corn and we lose between 11 and 30 kilograms of 30 tons per acre , or also to repose on square meters .
that means we &apos;re losing about five more and more than re-educated .
and of course , we can look at the waste problem .
and it &apos;s all packaging or content .
for example , in open stream , at the home of 20 percent of the garbage has wind .
and because we &apos;re getting older , the wind gets bigger .
it &apos;s kind of like all of you in the forefront phase .
yes ?
a baby needs about six of them .
we could reduce this for 10 percent , but what does it do ?
this is going to happen in china a second .
it &apos;s completely trivial .
so the question is , how do we deal with this windmill ?
here &apos;s one of the proof that men are not pigs .
i want to tell you .
because the phosphorus will be emitted in the pigs across the remote ingredients .
in humans over the urine .
yeah .
so men can &apos;t be pigs .
because that &apos;s it , right ?
traditionally , we think in environmental debate , we are too many on the world .
and if you talk to people , if you &apos;re talking to people , if you say that it &apos;s better , you &apos;re not going to be there , you &apos;re going to be blessed and hostile .
and so someone like al gore says one of our great heroes , there &apos;s nothing significant than stabilize human population .
in israel you say , if you &apos;re a living person , you save the earth .
here it says , the more you take away , the better .
yeah .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
if you look at the ants , the weight of the ants on earth , then the ants weigh four times more than we humans .
i could also take termites , but in the united states , no one like a termii , even though they &apos;re vegetarian .
that means the ants weigh a lot more than we do .
and because they work a lot harder than we do , and because they live only three to six months , they &apos;re in their weight , in the energy consumption .
that means we &apos;re not too stupid , we &apos;re too stupid , right ?
and where you &apos;re looking at it , what we really wanted to get away from , and how sad we are , that we are at all in the earth , you can see that for example , for example , there &apos;s a program that has a program , until 20 . you want to be here .
you can only be risky neutral if you don &apos;t exist , right ?
the only chance .
have you seen a carbon-neutral tree ?
yes ?
one ?
that means our whole intelligence means we want to be stupid than trees , right ?
yes ?
no tree is carbon neutral .
luckily , yes ?
there &apos;s no evidence of trees .
there &apos;s still six and a half billion trees alone .
have you ever heard anything about trees ?
that means all our intelligence means we want to be stupid than trees .
and where you see , even in something like demeter , the most strippy bio-- agriculture , doesn &apos;t allow us to go back .
every year we lose three million tons of phosphorus that really should go back in circular spaces .
and we are too many .
it &apos;s alone .
that &apos;s what we feel so guilty about the earth that we &apos;re saying , there &apos;s no organic production , no radiation , no inefficient , not a bio-and , and how they &apos;re all going to go back to our own increation .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
so we are too many .
it &apos;s safe to be less harmful , which is oil consumption .
but where are we useful ?
we &apos;re trying to minimize our ecological footprint , but it &apos;s about having a big footprint that is useful .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but if it &apos;s about the environment , it &apos;s the highest , right ?
nullemissions , yes ?
you can only have license missions if you &apos;re not there .
even if you shoot now , you would have emissions .
so you can &apos;t solve that .
we can do it differently .
we can extract our nutrients back .
we &apos;re doing agriculture in brazil in where we &apos;re going to return the nutrients .
right now , we can get nutrients back in agriculture .
we &apos;re doing that in china for example , where we &apos;re going to take it straight .
in china , it &apos;s a one-eyed apple today , so it &apos;s kind of like , right ?
and in our western world , we were always too dumb to bring our nutrients back .
that means that the whole western civilizatale draws that the city has always taken , but the farmers never had a difference .
so the cities had to grow more and more , because the farmers went to the cities and they had to move away their nutrients .
that &apos;s why all western rich are always expanding , until they haven &apos;t done the infrastructure , and then they &apos;re implosive .
yes ?
in china , it was different .
and you &apos;ve been able to get rid of a wooden civilization over five years because you &apos;re always able to bring nutrients back .
even today , if you &apos;re invited to eat in china , you &apos;re expected to eat as long as you &apos;re going to stay the toilet .
because it &apos;s unfriendly to go and increase nutrients .
you have them invited them to eat , not for food theft .
that means you can see in the internet how to extract the nutrients back .
this is actually a beautiful thing when you do that , so agriculture is creating biogas , in a country country country on an acre country , in the favelas , it can be about a thousand-five hundred dollars , with a farmer in order to grow chickens and fish and fish and vegetables and fish .
and the great thing about this is that the criminals rate in the favelas around nine-percent .
so we don &apos;t have to control people , just less bad .
we can support them to be good .
this is , of course , high-tech agriculture , but the plants themselves .
the side product is clean water .
and they &apos;re designed , through the design , which can just be a farmer .
that means that the criminals go back .
and none of these facilities , we &apos;ve now built over 100 and a half years in the last 20 years , none of these facilities have ever been done .
you could just throw out a liar so easily , and then the plant would be ruined over years .
don &apos;t find it .
that means we don &apos;t need to control people , just less bad .
we can support them to be good .
that means we need to get phosphorus back .
and by the way , if you want to do what &apos;s best about it , you &apos;re going to write in germany at the best outline of all the outsuits in france .
unfortunately , it doesn &apos;t open up , but maybe you can help the france a little bit .
because the frankdian plant could get the phosphorus back .
and it has to go back .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
and we see it doesn &apos;t work .
we &apos;ve now used over three years .
the dutch government has explained , you &apos;ll be the first country in the world , which is going to win phosphorus .
but we need that overall .
you know , there are two countries that control almost seven percent of the phosphorus in the world .
there is a whole bunch of orphans .
these are six countries who control four percent of the oil supplies .
and the oil will replace us through other energy supplies .
but you can &apos;t replace phosphorus .
this is not about making the existing a little less bad , but it &apos;s about doing something right .
and , mostly , to ask what the right thing is .
that means it &apos;s about efficiency , not about efficiency .
in holland , of course you understand that easier because in holland , the country is built on flowers .
yes ?
imagine if you &apos;ve got your wife sad , if you &apos;ve got them , and you come with 50 roses .
completely inefficient .
but even effective , yes ?
or take a drink .
a woman in germany eats about six millikilograms of life during her life .
that &apos;s what it is .
that &apos;s not exactly what it is right now , because we don &apos;t know how much kisses will be .
but a liop pen , even in this lighting , i can tell you , is it completely inefficient , but , right ?
one thing that is beautiful in life is not efficient .
that &apos;s not the resource efficiency , but efficiency .
to ask , what is the right thing ?
it &apos;s not enough to burn up a little bit better , and put it on it , and put it in the heat plant and lose the whole materials for circular , but first to ask , how do you do circular streams ?
imagine mozart efficient .
yes ?
if i invite you to dinner , and say yes , there &apos;s a pill with open taste and a glass of water .
wonderful , huh ?
that &apos;s efficient .
everything that is beautiful in life is not efficient .
if you fall in love with somebody , efficiently ?
yes ?
that means everything that matters in life is not to save it , avoid reducing .
all the environmental discussion .
we say the people , oh , you have no environmental consciousness in the south .
no , that &apos;s exactly the right thing , right ?
at any point , where you get away from , yes , you create life .
but the wrong things .
if you pull away the wrong things , you have a trash problem .
as we think of northern .
there &apos;s every foot reprint .
if you walk , everyone &apos;s going to destroy the ground .
because the ground is going to die the mosses , and the wind and the water load the ground .
but if you &apos;re in italy , every foot , everyone &apos;s print that the water remains longer in the meadow .
so , it &apos;s about creating a large footprint that will be a wetlands .
not school management .
we &apos;re in germany .
yes ?
but if i ask you , how about your wife ?
so what do you say ?
sustainable .
then i say , heart divers , yes ?
that &apos;s the minimum .
so not saving , prevent , avoid .
each waste is nutrient .
and it &apos;s a lust , if you can see in italy , the people in the high bow so that coke can get out of the car .
because you know , that &apos;s a fun process .
it &apos;s form of refour-behavior , right ?
you can show , i was there .
but with the right design , please .
so , for example , we &apos;ve developed an ice cream jet , which is liquid temperature .
you can kick away where you go and stand .
in two hours , they &apos;re building themselves everywhere .
and it contains seeds from rare plants so that they throw into biodiversity .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
so there are two strands .
not all of it should be compatible .
a television machine , or a washing machine , the use of them , they &apos;re not using them .
only the things that are combited , like shoe air , how sponges , like cars , have to be that they go into biological systems .
the things that are used only are in technical systems .
but today we &apos;re talking about the biological systems .
yes ?
for example , the sneaker , yes ?
pretty direct advertising , and it &apos;s not for the company , it &apos;s not for the company , but it &apos;s now helping you to make this business successful .
because we don &apos;t do things more free .
yes ?
so , if i invite you to dinner and say , that &apos;s free , you don &apos;t help you .
no , we put what &apos;s inside it .
positive .
so not like detox .
not toxic in it .
it &apos;s everything that is useful in it .
these are the first shoes that you can put on the ckins start at the footage , and the rubber in biological orbit can go , right ?
everything is complacable of it .
and if we can do it , of course , we can do it for the nike , for the nike , for hennes and for the prophet industry .
and that &apos;s half all of the water problems that are caused by the texture industry .
that &apos;s why you help , ask questions for people .
hey , puma , are you really serious ?
because now they have changed twice the sales of the supply .
and i &apos;m not so sure if they really did it .
so , help me a little bit .
but it &apos;s .
yeah .
that &apos;s what &apos;s been shown .
this is .
we can now do things like that , if you &apos;re going to get dressed , if you &apos;re broken , you can go into biological orbit .
technical roundstreams are the same .
there &apos;s a direct return system for this .
this is the first green backpack , actually , to go back into the loop .
so , in every store , you can get the things back .
if you get to that , yes ?
do you remember the windmill ?
now , that &apos;s the waste .
all right , this wind is around , almost .
in the countries where people come to money .
there on the front of the depoel , but otherwise in the landscape , right ?
if we change the plastics , so that it can go into biological systems when we can change the water storage , inside that they can go back to cell gas base , then they can reproduce with a baby in israel or tunisia .
yes ?
in fact , if you take these wines , you cut it , you tear and you take the powder to plant trees .
so this is the baby of carbon positive for the whole life , from the beginning .
so , we don &apos;t need to be neutral neutral , we can be climate change .
it &apos;s sort of a disruptive print .
yeah , somehow .
yes ?
we can do that .
we can reinvent everything else .
i started an institute .
now , there are lots of people working there , and they can get involved .
there is some extra one to turn cradles to cradle , where everyone can come in .
so no longer save , prevent , avoid , decrease , no school management , but smart waste .
does it make you curious ?
thank you .
the work of interpreted .
music .
in the description of my talk , i wrote that i as an interpretant , so in english english , i understand .
interpreted is the written notes in clinical music .
you know , as a translator , you didn &apos;t have a word for word text in another language , but also the deeper sense of the words and the word of the words that you have to understand with foreign languages .
already , to translate the english into english , more knowledge can require more knowledge , if you &apos;re going to do it , if you &apos;re talking or about poetry .
but it &apos;s really alien , but what we &apos;re doing with our music language .
when i first made a music show , i first got the writing notes .
you think the composer is written in the notes exactly what he &apos;s thought of .
in fact , the notes are very vague and unpredictable .
these notes are about the same as the exact same , as a verbal , if it really seems to be very clear , description of a landscape .
because in this case of the land description , the flowers don &apos;t smell the flowers of the flowers , the degree of the green , not listening to the target of the sky .
that means that the interpreter needs to reveal this unaccurate of speech language in another , which is white , concrete , non-verbal music language .
today , i want to share with you what i &apos;m doing in musical tunneles , so animals , once again , translate into a verbal language .
so basically a translation of translation .
so i &apos;m going to put it on german , because if i had to translate it into english again , it would be significant for me to translation the translation of translation .
so , the music works as much as the spoken word language .
the stage notes have the function of the letters of a script .
so it doesn &apos;t take it just to learn grades and get rid of the piano on the piano or to press the right place on a violin .
because that &apos;s just the letters you learned to paint .
the point of the letters you see when you can see the language .
so , for the learning process , music is at least as long as spoken spoken language .
there &apos;s also a lot of stuff , whether you learn it for the first need , you know , only passive , or you can also talk to it , until the musical ceo .
the work of the interpreted begins similar to the kind of exercise class .
after the first time you &apos;ve chosen to play a piece of play , because you &apos;re excited about some research , you &apos;re looking at the emergence of compositions .
you collect information about the piece in the sea literature .
you &apos;re reading in the letters , taelers , notes , or if it &apos;s words , thoughts from composers themselves .
you study the works he had before and after .
you compare it .
the cause is to write it .
how and what did he find ?
how did his life community , like the society and politics ?
it all interest me .
you &apos;re thinking in this time by looking at contemporary images , or reading literature .
but at the time , you &apos;ve also been able to know a rich kind of an interpretant to play the composers you &apos;re playing , and it &apos;s going to be easier to think in it and feel .
the phase is always more to the friend you live with .
his cause to write the piece is always becoming more and more to my personal concerns .
now , the notes all the other things as an accurate record of the composer represents , but only a framework , i &apos;m going to do this framework to fill it back with meaning and meaning .
i &apos;ll say to my own words , which might be written between this framework .
i play what these sounds mean to mean .
now for me , and for composers at the time , and what they could now mean for him .
every note , every phrase gets a sense , because i feel it myself , because it &apos;s my personal now .
it has to be for me here , and now i can &apos;t convince my audience that my concern is .
it &apos;s always a very happy concert when i have to have the experience that i have so long in advance , how new to experience .
as you can always see a happy new day , even though it &apos;s always with the same ritual of life , up there , there &apos;s going to work to work , and i &apos;ve got the same piece over to the new .
i have become a day older , and the seasons change , my pulse is going to slow down at night than the morning , in a concert hall , that sound comes back home .
i &apos;ll take the audience &apos;s breath , or unconsciously .
all that influenced me , and all that influenced my experience with comedy .
all right , if i stand with a duo partner on the stage , and we have the same wavelength .
then the same thing happens in a good , good conversation .
you bring a new idea into it and becomes the same answer with a reaction .
it &apos;s exciting , because things that we haven &apos;t been prosecuted and what you can &apos;t do .
it &apos;s great fun to make music in this way , and then as the audience , then you experience the music in life .
so every concert is a different concert .
i will never play as much as in this moment .
i can &apos;t play like in 20 years today .
i &apos;m going to have more life experience than today , and i &apos;m going to have a lot more of the color of music in the music of music , emotions and emotion as today .
sure , i &apos;m going to get a couple of colors out there , but i &apos;m going to get a couple of colors on it .
a nice example of this .
it was on a piano kursus for music students at my beloved old teacher , professor jremgen ude , a famous beethoven car-specific , concert tpianist and slow professor of music in graduate school .
unfortunately , i was a lot too young , so he was already emtered when i finally started studying .
but i had the great fortune , very early , with three , 10 years , and so i was at my high school .
i was 17 when i put up on one of his courses again , and i played the last of the four balbs of chopin , a long piece of time .
he asked me what the names of this ballet was for me .
this is a commitment part .
and in my youth , i said , expectation .
there he was sleeping and he said , &quot; ?
it has to be difference .
because for me it means memory .
he was over six .
well , with seventh , you just have dreams , but not a major memories .
i play the piece of all the years , and it has changed for me , although no one has changed .
every time it &apos;s exciting , i always read something new .
one example of this is a very different area . monet has released the seamles x .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but for different days , in different light .
he has retranslated the seamles , as he saw it , as you saw in this moment .
his personal impressions of the seamles .
the x-falls interpretation of a piece is this comparable .
now i &apos;m also older than a geek with two-and-a-half years when he wrote the piece .
he &apos;d lived only nine years .
and it &apos;s important to me again to look at the notes , even though i think you can memorize it .
to keep in twin with composers .
because the notes are the only connection to him .
especially if he died .
now , how do you start talking about the language of music ?
i said yes , you need about the same as spoken spoken language .
and often the music class is that you learn the notes .
you typically learn that first , before you talk only one word .
you learn to find the sound on your instrument .
when all the fingers in time and right , like it is in the notes , they come out of the notes , they come out of sounds like music .
when the error happens , the student gets the next difficult piece .
you can &apos;t talk about interpretation in the early class .
well , there it is in front of the front , that &apos;s a fast piece .
lento , slowly .
according to it , according to it , f and b , etc .
most of you are familiar with this .
but even if you plot these up , it still stays a little bit technical .
and it &apos;s still not a interpretation .
i wonder .
i wonder that you often eat something very basic .
because , in order to make music on the instrument , you have to do the musical and feel you have to be there before .
that &apos;s the singing .
a child who didn &apos;t learn the singing because it didn &apos;t take the parents , it won &apos;t do it itself .
this is like learning to talk .
it &apos;s necessary to have its own experiences , and the idea of the music to make it about another way , so it sounds about an instrument .
people who have never been able to have their own bodies have never felt the same directly with their own body .
a phrase with his own breath .
the music child is the extension of our body .
our vocal boards to sing , our hands and feet to dance .
so the hammerheads in the piano are the sequel of my fingers .
the melody comes out of the normal and the rhythm of the dance .
the longest reported today is not available .
you don &apos;t need to make it more yourself if you get bored .
no longer required to whistle a guy or singing .
each of your own music is made by the outside of music , and it &apos;s constantly labeled by the outside .
sure , there are some of you who say , yes , but what if i can &apos;t sing ?
the question i can do is not sing , a , because they believe they can &apos;t sing ?
or b , because they didn &apos;t learn to sing ?
it &apos;s not too late to start to figure out if you can &apos;t or learn it , or learn how to use these little muscles that have the vocal chords , right .
that &apos;s what you can train .
or c , because you put it to them , they &apos;re untapped .
so i ask myself , how did this diagnosis was this diagnosis ?
have you taken a second -- or 13 , how do you get it beautiful today ?
or d , you don &apos;t like music , and therefore you want to have nix to do it .
but then what i would regret , because music is a beautiful , communicative thing .
but maybe you can still agree .
so , you know , you can see all the cases have to be out of a scratch candidate .
but they don &apos;t even say , i don &apos;t understand the classic music .
i can &apos;t say whether it &apos;s good or bad .
i said , but surely you can tell you if it or not .
because i don &apos;t think somebody says , i don &apos;t know if it tastes , because i can &apos;t cook .
so , they don &apos;t give up , just because they can &apos;t cook .
so you don &apos;t have to get rid of classical music , because you don &apos;t play an instrument .
listen to it and say whether it tastes or not .
whether the music is given to you or too sweet .
say what they feel .
at the time , they also get spray and they want to have a little bit more spet , or taste even a difference .
now , why do i challenge from my audience to listen to it ?
because the music is a language and a language is to communicate .
an art that you never look at has no power to work .
the food that was loving by a chef or a chef has to be eaten by a chef , not just looking at recipes .
so please hear if a music is played .
it &apos;s not just a nice sound paper .
if in a environment , where the adults make music , or at least active music , is a child growing up , it &apos;s easy for a music teacher to ask , which color has your flower ?
now can you play it in blue ?
and the child plays after a memorial , instead of having a red flower now .
and this sounds very different than that .
that was the first beginning of a musical expression .
so the first step to a interpretation .
and what happens when you play a piece today , which has been written in front of a hundred , two hundred or three hundred years ago ?
now , the tools evolve .
there was no turning on at the time as an instrument .
it was just not invented .
i think that the bach would have been excited if it had been the sound of the kind of modern life in the modern world .
i can now get the sound beliefs that had the stream , to the modern wing to sound , which can &apos;t be a barocker .
and by beethoven , you know that he heard more than he had already been deaf .
today , modern orchestra is able to play everything , which is an orchestra from the back as unplay remote .
and that &apos;s why composers rely on us to make the pieces rereinvent .
so you can listen to what you &apos;ve just thought of in the mind .
and also , what you would think about today .
or what i &apos;m thinking about today is because what you might have thought is .
thank you .
you know what envy is ?
were they even envy ?
and how did that feel ?
suck .
i have a friend who drives a pasthesis .
when i come to my little v pizza , and i &apos;m wrong , this feeling goes on .
i put something through my head .
i say , &quot; why do you need big car ? &quot;
that &apos;s what &apos;s going on in the first year half of his value .
and at all , you work much less than i am .
why do i have to afford a little car ?
and then i immediately think that &apos;s uneasy .
it &apos;s against justice .
and how i say the word justice is this unpleasant feeling .
our organism has invented a great way to get these inpleasant feelings like envy just to disappear .
you can try and look at it with words like revenge or whatever .
i want to tell you a little bit about this mechanism today or something that is unconsciously familiar with you .
the mechanism comes from lie .
but don &apos;t think of the lie as you may have heard , if people say , no one has the intention to build a wall .
and then rocks , so he would give you the view .
in such a lie , you see that the ligself doesn &apos;t believe what he says .
it makes it easy to check that it &apos;s very different .
it &apos;s just deceiving you and not yourself .
no , the lie that i &apos;m talking about , which has to do with it .
they need this lie to get a life lie down to a self-deception .
they can make them less easy , yes , test or recess .
they need time .
from that time , an anecdote is talking to you .
the spanish painter pabfer picasso once wrote a woman .
and this woman was at the time , the portrait would not look like her .
picasso says just wait .
it will always be more similar .
at this point , if you laugh , you realize how important this lie is and how much time you need to experience something very good , what artists can tell us .
because artists have a disconnect to lie .
the artists share something with them , and especially this lady , what they don &apos;t see when they just look in the mirror .
the artist gives you a little bit of a portrait of what you &apos;re going to be familiar with when you look at this piece of work .
and then this unpleasant feeling disappears , it could not look like you , and it will always become more similar .
here you have this mechanism with which we can use the lie as a great invention to stabilize our lives .
and not only in art , also in the mythology , in the mythology of the mythology , it comes back again .
you may know this idea of the lady who looked at each morning in the mirror and asked him who is the most beautiful in the country ?
one day , this mirrors says , yes , there &apos;s a more beautiful one .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
and you also know how much hostility from this true effect , the mirror can &apos;t lie , from this true effect .
but we should just make sure that you can &apos;t tell a woman that there &apos;s a more beautiful somewhere else .
so here it is required to get what we understand under a fluctuation .
we need this one that &apos;s where this lie , which holds us down to deception without that .
we don &apos;t just have art in the art , but also in science , it &apos;s such a wonderful lie .
and there &apos;s this story of the queen of the bischofs of vocabulary .
she heard about this book by charles darwin , who was the origin of the species and the coets of man .
that the person from the apes should come out and , yes , at least a common ancestor between people and monkeys .
and then she ran up to her husband , and she said , that &apos;s not true what charles da wrote .
the human being came from the monkey or a common ancestor .
no , no , it &apos;s not .
and if it &apos;s true , we have to stop that people get knowledge of it .
why do we need to prevent people to get knowledge from something that is true ?
because we can &apos;t live without this life lie .
because we have these self-deception , this feeling , great to be a pool of the highest creatures , not from one of these rare ones , from something like this , from something like an organism that exists , a rock like an organism , and whatever things that are unstoppable for us .
so , we can &apos;t afford these things .
we need to prevent people to get knowledge from things , especially when they &apos;re true .
so you can see how slowly this mechanism solves , and how the traces look , which he &apos;s leaving , who will leave on something else than that great picture of ourselves , i want to give you another story .
a particularly beautiful story , like me .
my wife told me it .
she came from school one day , she &apos;s a teacher , and she told me about a student .
a autistic student .
it likes to be especially like it because he &apos;s got a propodness for it .
and she asked him , what are your hobbies ?
and he says , well , i &apos;m at the fire department .
and because i &apos;m at the fire department , i &apos;m interested in paroengineering things .
yeah , you &apos;re feeling it , if you &apos;re hot at this point . there &apos;s something wrong .
i said to my wife , whenever a person in a moral legal attack is the concept because , we should try to replace it by replacing the funny self .
do that once , and then you experience the sentence .
although i &apos;m at the fire department , i &apos;m interested in paroengineering things .
they feel that this is the real truth behind that .
so a little bub that &apos;s not interested in the fire .
they &apos;re interested in the fire .
but there &apos;s no such thing as we can look at where we learn how to make fire .
there &apos;s only the second best , the firemen .
there he is .
and it &apos;s also , you know , you &apos;re not saying , you know , you don &apos;t like to put any of your teacher somewhere , and you &apos;re happy when the fire is going up .
no , it just looks a lot better if we show that we &apos;re in charge of it , the dangers that make the difference , if you just put fire .
here you have this little mechanism .
this clue that in the spirit of the bub has already known that he &apos;s actually related to the fire , but he can &apos;t say that .
here you have this censor between the unconscious and the conscious , which jumps out immediately without the fact that you can do something about it , and the things that you know are very different for you and others .
so , you can just get these words that we &apos;re using in the language of political speech .
actually , we know something else is the case .
but we know when we talk about that , the social guidance is very sensitive .
we can &apos;t just do that .
it &apos;s impossible to do things like this in a society that should work .
now i want to introduce you to what we &apos;ve found in my institute .
after what logic is that deception , these self-deception , the willingness to be a different reality than the ones that we actually know in the unconscious that it &apos;s external .
i want to show you two , maybe three , maybe three .
the first example is that what many of you know , and some of you estimate , very few times .
i mean the soul .
what is the soul ?
the soul is such an intellectual thing , about leibniz .
it &apos;s something that doesn &apos;t stop from stop , materient nature .
and if you have people who are more intense , you can have a soul , or you can say , you know , that they have been fed from the soul to life , then they think about it as if the soul is such a spiritual framework about them , not matter ; they &apos;re just dead , they &apos;re dead , no important , they &apos;re dead .
and from this soul , you &apos;re now thinking that you &apos;re kind of in this cloudy nature , in this vending nature , anima called it in the latin , the air present .
and then , if this wave of air is going to go through the people , then it &apos;s filled with dignity with nature , with nature , that can only live with soul .
and then he can walk away .
this is the idea of how the soul works .
so it &apos;s supposed to come from the outside to people .
so we &apos;re supposed to be aware of what should be present for our lives .
and if you have this premise of eyes , then you understand the logic that we &apos;re experiencing that happiness with a lie to improve our world .
because now you can apply a three-sentence .
you know , you know , three and a half feet of school .
now this is a three-sentence that describes us a logic .
this is the hardest part in my talk , by the way .
here you need some logic , but also the willingness to lie .
because that &apos;s how to lie , that you can just apply this logic wrong .
in this three-sentence , three sentences .
the first sentence is that there is no soul .
so the second sentence is , if it &apos;s right , it doesn &apos;t have a soul .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
i put it in particular .
a third sentence , which immediately shows people who have a strong sense of a soul .
they say who doesn &apos;t have a soul who &apos;s dead and can &apos;t say anything .
and here they are .
here comes this logic in this , yes , in this premise of speech .
you see it immediately .
the first two sentences that are logical .
i can say everything .
the logic doesn &apos;t make any talk about reality .
i can say the canary is a man .
and when i &apos;m right , the canary is a man .
if i didn &apos;t get right , it &apos;s not a man .
the logic doesn &apos;t make any point about what &apos;s going on .
i can claim everything .
but the key is , if i &apos;ve got right , it &apos;s true .
so if you say , there &apos;s no soul .
second , if he &apos;s right , he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
these things are logical correctly .
and now , our dismismation of consciousness feels you can do something about it .
it depends on a third sentence , which has nothing to do with the first two sentences , and that &apos;s what it does when the first sentence of the first sentence has been proven and predicted .
because in fact , we have to prove whether there &apos;s the soul or not .
but with this logic , which is simply using it , that two sentences are logical , and a third , which looks like he had something to do with it , we can save our lives .
so , we do that as it &apos;s actually impossible , without able to live a soul .
and we &apos;re very happy about that .
we can lead these things to different examples .
in the present , we have a modern example of a modern example , and that &apos;s always the daytime newspaper .
you have to imagine another philosophical issue , a permanent of philosophy , mind .
this has to do with that , we go back to the fourth century .
there was a scholars who was called johannes buridanus and after that is named the buridanan esel .
the buridanan esel is an esel , which is from pure nature .
it didn &apos;t have this soul .
this is a natural thing .
and if you put the exact right place in the middle between two and a half , he &apos;s hungry .
because he doesn &apos;t know what to do there first .
so he &apos;s in the middle .
so the nature was introduced .
it &apos;s a huge amount of forces to solve each other .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
only if you take another example , so if you immediately do a bunch of time , then it doesn &apos;t need reason to do anything .
automatically , he goes to the right idea .
so if you have this idea that , in nature , you &apos;re kind of driven to the nature of the larger crowd , from the larger , the larger , you have the sense that there must be something like a free will .
and if we &apos;re already here in france at primary , i remember the max plander institute for brain science .
there &apos;s a category that is called wolf , and you &apos;re sometimes saying , you know , wolf , there &apos;s no passive freedom .
now we can form the second sentence , and we can say , if wolf is right , it doesn &apos;t have any freedom .
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
and what we can actually read almost every day in the daydays that you can find in this third sentence .
it looks like this , who doesn &apos;t have any freedom of freedom , can &apos;t be moved for its actions and claims to responsibility , and therefore it &apos;s impossible .
you also have it again .
in fact , you would have to prove whether there &apos;s such a freedom of freedom .
but the logic of deception allows us to do that as if the first sentence is wrong , as it would have to be wrong , of course .
and now you can just do something if you want to test anything , if you want to test yourself , and especially if you want to make people happy , that courage to lie .
practice that for example , if you look at a person who you can say , there &apos;s no exceptions .
and please don &apos;t use the german word for predicted , the prophet .
you can &apos;t call that a little bit more politically accurate .
say , there &apos;s no exceptions .
immediately , you &apos;re going to have one , for granted , for granted that you can &apos;t prove .
and you have a problem .
because while they &apos;re busy , they &apos;re not able to prove that there are no exceptions , the man is really happy .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he deceived them .
because he led them to a race that he didn &apos;t stop himself .
because actually , this man isn &apos;t interested in evidence .
it &apos;s just interested in keeping themselves out of the need to have to prove that there are exceptions .
so , in the way of shifting the evidence of the evidence , you will experience the great lie .
and once you have an opportunity to feel that three-sentence in other people , they do it , because they &apos;re going to make other happy , if they don &apos;t remember them in this way .
thank you for your attention .
yeah , good afternoon .
i was allowed to have lilly wondered if i can tell you .
she &apos;s one of the organios here , and he asked me if i wanted to have a talk here , and i asked my idea .
i &apos;ve got to say , you &apos;ve got it , you &apos;ve got it hard to talk about my idea .
and i may think maybe my lab project is that i &apos;m trying to imagine you .
but , of course , the sum is very , very many ideas .
i &apos;m probably , you know , the two nice girls still , i &apos;m probably in the generation of the generation that &apos;s made for this bad oil image , because i &apos;ve been starting to study the two hundred hundred thirds of the seventh , because i &apos;ve been starting to study the machinery .
and i went to berlin in the middle of the &apos; 80s , because i wanted to make renewable energy and i didn &apos;t have that in karlsburn .
there was the core research facility called leopoldbs .
all the kfa at the time was the jewish name .
the hot days today .
because a good engineer has either built a great car or nuclear power plants .
but something like &quot; n solar pendel , &quot; which looks like a hundred watts from the square square square meter .
and in berlin , there was a terrifying engineering collective .
i &apos;m grateful to the prime scientist , that he recalls the word again again , because after the case , you didn &apos;t use the word anymore , because everything left was bad .
however , it wasn &apos;t like that .
there was this thing that there was self-managed alternative , and one of them was sitting in a square hill , where you would expect evil .
in the middle of the terrorist , but this was called baneltronics and made wind and sunenergy , and i started in the middle of the &apos; 80s .
and yes , a lot of what was said today is touched me , because many , many beautiful things that i &apos;ve been living through .
i spent 11 years working in the collective , which was grassroots .
we were 20 people .
if you said no , it was the familiar break , it has a completely broken one . i &apos;ve got 10 years i &apos;ve been worrying about whether i might really have my great engineering professor , because all the colleagues of my father always talked to him about the window of the money .
it &apos;s busy .
and that was really , really , very bitter and then you get into this stage , just recording a picture on where i asked myself for 10 years , a thousand degrees of mark , whether that &apos;s supposed to be the great thing .
and then i gave it up to six , and then we got together with friends , and i grew up with friends of the company , which then became the spin-off of rock of one of the largest cellular manufacturers in the world .
a huge story , but , of course , we &apos;ve got the problem of a growing company and then we have two thousand , a small group , decided that we &apos;re going to go back and go back and get the next topic of the future , we &apos;re not talking about store .
and i brought you a project that i &apos;d like to introduce you to .
and the title of the talk was yes , as you get to a hundred percent renewable .
and we just started asking a relatively simple story about where you could have a memory today .
this is the island of graciosa on the azarians .
yeah , these are the data .
there are four thousand people living there .
now , they have an renewable energy share of five percent .
and the question is , why don &apos;t they have more ?
it &apos;s not just technological .
if you build more wind power , the system begins to fail .
i also tell the politicians , if you put in berlin-adof shof our facility .
they &apos;re always saying , why ?
we &apos;ve got 20 percent in germany .
it can &apos;t be a problem .
but not true , we have seven percent and our net is physically seen the european .
if we had in europe 20 percent , we would have the same problems that people have on this island .
the question was simple , that was a two-year 2006 , the first contacts started with the island , but just by the way .
as big as it would have to be a battery , so you actually have an island on 20 , 30 , 50 , maybe even 17 percent renewable .
and yes , i go back to a slide .
the conventional system looks like this in the world .
by the way , a hundred gigawatts of electric power will be built on al-qaeda based on the world .
that &apos;s a hundred nuclear power power , because it &apos;s very fast everywhere .
the energy hunger in the world is being deleted , because you don &apos;t need permission .
that &apos;s fast .
you put it like this .
and then it looks like this .
in the run of three of those , two will always be waiting .
yes , this is what this is going on down there .
we also have very detailed data .
and the wind plant , or the solar system , or whatever it is , is in the rule of a close-up system , which is a system that can only eat in small quantities here .
our goal was just to say , okay .
the el is going to go and the wind , the sun , use the load so that they can form the bigger percentage .
and if you want to go over 20 , 30 percent renewable energy , energy per year , not the performance in the moment , you have to turn it off .
that means that at the moment you have to worry that renewables can take the whole net .
you can just , of course , if you &apos;re in some kind of fashion , and you can be here in a way .
no one has done this yet in the world .
this is what &apos;s in the small style , so you can also use your shave over a little interaction .
the people always ask me , what do you actually do in adhtsshof ?
it &apos;s already happening .
but if you want to judge these facilities together , and you want to build a net , that &apos;s very complicated .
and our goal was , we wanted to go to seven to nine-percent renewable , and then there &apos;s still this rest of the rest , the last 10 , 20 percent renewable , that will be very , very expensive and that &apos;s not going to work for batteries .
this is going to be a energy supply , which then , hydrogen , methane , power to gas , you know , it will be .
they have to go to a seasonal store , and they have to go out summer and not just at night .
we just wanted to know what &apos;s going on with a normal , striknormal electrochemical battery .
how far do you get there ?
and then there &apos;s a whole lot of simulation .
and they have wind and sun , and the load of the sun , and they came out to the result , a very interesting outcome , that you need a middle of the conventional system that takes about 20 cents an hour of a kilowatt-hour .
these were the first calculations six years ago .
and then we said , okay .
yes , we have a business model .
we are cheaper as the globsystem , when the accelerator rises five percent a year .
and then we started to negotiate with the tinkering .
what should everything be done ?
in fact , with investors , i &apos;ve looked for new camels .
we were at the time only five people to rebuild society .
and here &apos;s the representation .
the brown is kind of the conventional system , the green is our system .
that our system also has a kidney left , it &apos;s because we &apos;re going to do 20 percent with this , and also a price increase on the other things .
and the power catalog , which is the electricity company on the island , has meant that we find it very well .
let &apos;s support , but we don &apos;t believe that you can solve the technical problem .
and so we &apos;ve decided to build a hall in berlin where we can sort of form the electric landscape of the island at three to three .
that means we first looked at the largest battery in the world .
here it is .
this is natural from asia , in the case of japan .
and the funny thing is , it &apos;s in the seventh years in the seventh of the years of the bbc , and today , it has been evolving , and then they &apos;re licensed on the japanese .
you can see , it &apos;s a very , very large battery .
she &apos;s got a megamegawatt performance , and she can bring this performance for six hours , and that &apos;s the battery that we have to get out of .
and then they set up .
we also have one of these kind of tr-catalog in the same size , as it says , in the hall , in fact , to actually the full dynamic behavior of this web , so in the middle hall , it &apos;s going to be that there &apos;s the big battery that we simulate the net .
over here , we can simulate the whole communicative framework system , the miles of the cable , to sort of make the vibrational behavior in the web .
and here you can see the whole thing .
we can also turn two hundred kilowatts of photovoltaics on the web .
here we see this again again , again , again , the same , single , single , same , same , same , same .
and what we &apos;ve done since two-thousand- nine was the hall , until today , to two thousand twelve , almost everything that was here between the single system of electronics , we made software .
so we &apos;re not a battery manufacturer , but we define ourselves as a company , which is only between the topic of battery and the internet , and everything in between .
you have to communicate to the battery , of course , to communicate in the web , and that &apos;s very complicated .
the beauty is that , in this island , you can basically take away everything that can take care of problems that we &apos;re going to get when we want to increase our share of renewables .
so this whole discussion , which is going to move right now , and the energy energy , how it &apos;s supposed to go to the island , for example , for example , for instance , we have the wind , for example , for five to 30 percent of the average energy , so we &apos;re changing the wind and the sun .
natural light then provides smart grid .
so smart grid , a huge issue everywhere .
we &apos;ve been able to do it on the island of this , to integrate electromobility , to ask , to say , you can do the burden .
that means when you &apos;re at seventh percent renewable , you can &apos;t do it without memory .
you can do it through n wells , you can build through networks , yes , you should do it in any case , but you can never get rid of memory .
and that &apos;s what the message is .
so there &apos;s a lot of people and looking at this , because you can see what problems you get .
if we turn it down , you &apos;re not going to have this raw mass that causes a certain kind of inertia in the net .
and our european relies , basically , is just a mere mass of large power plants , where the wave is all around europe .
we &apos;re looking at this net in this grid , and the 50 hertz , and if it &apos;s going to be four-tenths of four hertz , we &apos;re starting to do a little bit of fusion , then again , come back up .
that &apos;s the system .
and of course , it &apos;s incredibly generalized .
if you tear it down somewhere , it takes for a while .
the disruptive reserves have at least 10 seconds to keep the net stable .
and at the time they can respond again .
if you don &apos;t have that , these rosticors , then you have to replace it with treatment and electrochemistry .
and we can switch out with this big battery , two milliseconds a second .
and then you see the enormous amount of data there .
and the message is now , we need to get rid of these rodents , if we kind of like our goals , 20 , 20 percent , 20 percent , 30 percent , 30 percent and so on , if we want to do that at all .
then we have to break our must-run capacity in the net .
must-run is simply going to run the power station to keep the frequency .
yes , that &apos;s a huge debate right now , reconstruction from the coal force , because we don &apos;t , or gavage , because it &apos;s not .
and we &apos;re just trying to figure out that you have the capacity , the must-run capacity , can hold down , by putting electrochemical memory into the net .
now , fortunately , there &apos;s a whole bunch of studies .
and to this purpose , people will always come and look at our investigations on the way of our lab .
and yes , the discussion is always about the question , how far can you take away a piece of future ?
and a lot of discussions that i had in the last six years were similar to the discussion that i had in the last 30 years for solar .
it &apos;s not , it &apos;s cracker , child play stuff , we don &apos;t have anything to do .
we have 30 gigawatts today in germany .
that &apos;s the precursor .
and i just go from that , in the next 30 years , the same capacity of electrochemical store around the world .
very simple , it will come .
there will be a whole bunch of disadvantages and points .
the nice thing is that i &apos;ve experienced this in the last two years that the scientists are sitting on my side .
we &apos;ve got about 10 million of the stuff that we have now to get , in fact , about 10 megawatt-battery now in the german web .
this is going to happen in april 17th .
so , from that , you also realize that there &apos;s a change there , and it &apos;s only from that decline to the idea that it &apos;s a hundred percent renewable .
and if you have a hundred percent renewable , it &apos;s like an autarper system .
and so far , in arguments , it &apos;s always trying to do this kind of disruptive , which is going to be a very small web that has a little bit of a small net , and nothing to do .
the question is , if you &apos;re completely independent , if you &apos;re completely independent from any fossil energy or ancient energy , you get out of the world , and you &apos;re going to get to them , you &apos;re an island .
then they just use what &apos;s going on in the sun and wind where they live .
and this is a little bit of our vision of overenergy energy and i &apos;m grateful to cradle to cradle that they &apos;re using sunenergy .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do , also , the talk of prime collagen , that you can be a collective , and you can use sunenergy , here &apos;s a little bit together .
and yeah , i just want to encourage you , in the sense that you can be a little bit crazy , and you may have a vision .
and you really have to stay pretty tough , but i think it &apos;s going to happen .
thank you .
when steve lopez is the los angeles times , one day through the streets of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , an african-american artist , sympathy , razic , homeless , homeless , who was just two sacred .
many of you will know the story , because from steves articles about it later , a book that was turned on , with robert spielney junior , as steve lopez , and jamie doux as a &quot; the double , &quot; was finished by his paranoids , and his promising career in the early world .
nathaniel left juilliard , led a nerve breakdown , and 30 years later , he lived as homeless on the streets of los angeles .
i recommend to read all of them , or to see the film , so that they don &apos;t just understand the wonderful connectedness that came between these two men , but also , like the music that helped to get the instrument , and how they &apos;re allowed to get the instrument in the street .
i met mr. ayers in 2008 , two years ago , in walt disney fisher hall .
he just had heard a demo of beethoven &apos;s chest first and fourth singing , and she came up with the stage to imagine me .
he spoke in a very hot and sophisticated note about yo-yo ma and hillary clinton , and about how the dodgers would never make it in the baseball world series , and that &apos;s all because of the first term of beethoven &apos;s tail in the last sentence .
we came to talk about music , and a few days later , i got an email in that , that nathaniel was interested in education at me .
i still have to say that nathaniel gave birth to a medical treatment , because it was already been treated with electric shocks and handadal and hand-charged , a trauma that has been tracking his whole life .
now , as a result of this , it &apos;s particularly vulnerable to these schizophrenics , and they &apos;re sometimes so bad , and he &apos;s going to go around in the streets of skid row , and that horror of his own mind .
and in the same way that nathaniel was , when we started in the beaudisney , we started with our first staff in the beaudisney , and he was completely lost in his eyes .
he talked about invisible wass and smoke , and how someone wanted to survive in the sleep .
i was afraid not to believe , but i was afraid that i could lose him in one of his states , and that i could destroy him to destroy his relationship when i started talking about clay and arpegos , and other exciting forms of didatives .
so i just started playing .
i played the first sentence of beethoven &apos;s friinconcert .
and while i was playing , i noticed that in nathania &apos;s eyes , a complete change was going on .
it was like he was under an invisible doctor &apos;s influence , a chemical reaction that was catalyzed my game .
nathanide manian anger turned into understanding , in a quiet curiosity and anpression .
and as through a miracle , he took his mind and started playing some cuts of violinm , and then asked me to play them at the end : mendelsson , thrwkoski .
we started talking about music , started to talk about beethoven , brams , bruckner and all the other crosbs , from bark k to esa peon .
and i realized that he didn &apos;t just know a nerd about music , but it was a very close personal relationship with her .
he talked about her with a passion and an understanding that i knew only from my colleagues in the philharmony of los angeles .
by playing music , and talking about music , it was made out of this paranoid , confused man , which was just being pulled through the streets of los angeles , a loving , educated , educated , in judaism .
music is medicine . music is changing .
for nathaniel , music means sea health .
because the music allows him to come up with his thoughts and delusions with his imagination and creativity in something real .
and so he came up with his horror states .
i understood that exactly this is the nature of art .
this is the reason why we make music : so we do something that is in all of us , deeply inside , our emotions , through our artistic lens , through our creativity to reality .
and the reality of this expression is all of us , and it moves , inspired and united .
what nathaniel anwent , he brought it back into a community of friends .
the power force of music brought him back into a family of music , who understood his talent , and he led him .
and i &apos;m always going to play with nathaniel music , whether or not in the yo-yo , or in skid row , because he reminds me why i &apos;d become musicians .
thank you .
bruno giussani : thank you . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play something that i &apos;ve been stolen by the cellimost .
i hope you forgive me .
so i have a lot of fish in my life .
i just loved two .
this first one that was more like a passionate monkey .
it was a beautiful fish , responsible , good consistent , a good one on the menu .
what a fish .
even better , he was drawn to the highest standards of sustainability .
so you could feel to sell it .
i had a relationship with this beauty over several months .
one day , the head of the company called , if i could put in an event on the other side of the farm .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
here was a company that tried to solve what this unimaginable problem has become for our cooks , how do we keep fish on our menu ?
in the last 50 years , we have increased the ocean as we beat the forest .
it &apos;s hard to overgrade the destruction .
90 percent of the big fish that we love , the tuna , the healing , the lax , the heavy fish , they &apos;re collapsed .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
so , yes , or bad predators , build , build a part of our future .
a lot of arguments about it . fish intercount the environment , most of them , and they are inefficient , we take tuna . a big disadvantage .
he has a diet of every 15 to one .
that means that 15 pounds of wild fish are required to get a pound tuna .
not very sustainable .
it doesn &apos;t taste very well .
so here was finally a company trying to do it right .
i wanted to encourage them .
in front of the day , i called the ceo of the public audition for the company .
let &apos;s call him .
&quot; don &apos;t , &quot; i said , &quot; just to have the facts right , you &apos;re famous to build so far outside in the sea that you don &apos;t contaminate the environment . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s true , &quot; he said . &quot; we &apos;re so far outside that the waste of our fish is distributed , not focused . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; we &apos;re basically a world .
and that feed of nato , he said , &quot; he said .
&quot; the best in industry . &quot;
sadly , great .
&quot; hang on one thing ? what do you feed ? &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
&quot; great , &quot; i said .
and at this evening i was in bed , and i thought , what hell is a sustainable protein ?
so i called up the next day , just before the event , don &apos;t .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t , what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said he doesn &apos;t know that . he &apos;ll ask .
well , i was using a couple of people in the company . no one could give me a proper answer . until finally , i finally did the biologists .
let &apos;s call it also .
&quot; don &apos;t i say , &quot; for example , what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some algae and some fish fish , and then he said , chicken pellets .
i said , &quot; chicken carlets ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , fethers , skin , bone flons , squirched and food . &quot;
i said , &quot; how much percent of food is chicken ? &quot;
in the assumption of maybe two percent .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t , what is sustainable about fish to fish ? &quot;
there was a long pause in the line and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken in the world . &quot;
i loved that fish .
no , not because i &apos;m a self-serving , and a good person .
that &apos;s me .
no , i actually went from this fish from this fish because , i swear to god , the fish for this conversation to chicken .
this second fish that &apos;s a different kind of love story .
it &apos;s the romantic kind of romantic , the kind of thing you know , the better you know your fish , you love the fish .
i used to eat it first in a restaurant in southern spain .
a friend of mine had talked about this fish for a long time .
she &apos;s in a way .
he came up on the table with a bright white color .
the chef had cooked him .
hold twice .
amazingly , he was still delicious .
who can taste a fish so well after it &apos;s been eaten ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
let &apos;s call it miguel . in fact , he &apos;s called miguel .
and no , he didn &apos;t feed the fish , and he &apos;s not a chef , at least in the way that you and i understand .
he &apos;s a biologist at aa la palma .
this is a fish set up in the southwest corner .
it &apos;s close to the coins of the river .
until the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of argentinians .
they raised carnicattle on what was essentially wetlands .
they did that by destroying the land .
they built this complicated set of channels , and they picked water out of the land and outside into the river .
well , they couldn &apos;t make that that worked , not economically .
and ecologically was a disaster .
it took about 90 percent of the birds to be a lot of birds .
and so 1982 has bought a spanish company with environmental awareness .
what did they do ?
they have the flow of water .
they literally launched the lever .
instead of putting out the water , they use the channels to pull the water back .
they drove the channels .
they set up a $ 1,000 of acres of fish -- barsh , mermaid , garnents , aal -- and there &apos;s miguel and his company &apos;s ecological destruction completely opposite .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen something like this .
they &apos;re looking at the horizon , which is a million miles away , and all they &apos;re seeing are channels and these density , lual march .
i was there not a long time ago .
he &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts charles , and a part of a crocodile to the kiss .
okay ? there we were , and we fought through the wetlands , and i diddle , and i scraped , to my knees to my knees , and miguel keeps a biology lecture .
here he picks up a rare strip .
now he mentioned the mineral needs of physical toplankton .
and here , here he sees a pattern of por, which reminds him to the eradication giraffe .
it turns out that miguel is spent the largest part of his career in mikich national park in africa .
i asked him how to become a fish expert .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish .
i &apos;m an expert for relationships . &quot;
and then it goes down and down in more recent birds and algae and weird water plants .
and don &apos;t get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the biological community undisturbed .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
and my head was going to be weak about this sort of demitted piece of delicious that i had at the end of the night .
so i quit him . i said , &quot; miguel , how do you get your fish so well ? &quot;
he showed up on the algae .
&quot; i know young , the algae , the physical toplankton , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible .
but what do you eat ?
how is the foragers ? &quot;
well , he goes on to tell me that it &apos;s such a rich system that the fish would eat what they would eat in the wild .
the vegetable biomass , the phytoplankton , the zooplankton , is what the fish feeds .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely self-political .
there &apos;s no food .
one farm belongs from a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals ?
later , i went around on this site with miguel , and i asked him , &quot; for a place that seems to be so natural , &quot; unlike every farm i &apos;ve ever been , &quot; how do you measure success ? &quot;
in the moment , it was like a movie director would have to change a stage .
and we pumped around the corner and gave us the most incredible sight , thousands and thousands and thousands of different theories , literally a unity of the eye .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at your skin , pink .
they suck . &quot;
bad ? i was completely confused .
i said , &quot; miguel , don &apos;t you make your fish ? &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
&quot; we &apos;re losing 20 percent of our fish and fish eggs to the birds .
well last year on this site 600,000 birds were more than 250 different species .
it has become the largest and one of the most important private birds in europe .
i said , &quot; miguel , is it good for bird flu , the last thing you want to do on a fish fish ? &quot;
he took his head , no .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building specialization , not intense .
this is an environmental network .
the flares eat the shrimp .
the shrimp eat the physical toplankton .
so the interference of the gut is the better the system . &quot;
okay , let &apos;s rethink this . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals and a farm that measures their success at the health of their predators .
a fish set up , but also a bird reserve .
oh , and by the way , they don &apos;t even want to be there in the suburbs .
they put 240 miles away in a city where the soil is better for nest maintenance nest .
every morning they fly 240 miles to farm .
and every night they fly 240 miles back .
they do that because they can follow the white line of land in the street .
seriously .
i was struck by the penguins of the penguins , so i looked at miguel .
i said , &quot; miguel , fly 240 miles to the farm , and then you go to 240 miles at night ?
do you do that for the kids ? &quot;
he looked at me when i was following a song of whitney houston .
he said , &quot; no . they do that because the food is better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my beloved fish , which was delicious , and i don &apos;t like fish skin . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it .
this is the end of the end , the taste of cooked .
i almost never cooked it .
and yet , when i tried to do it in this restaurant in southern spain , she didn &apos;t look at fish skin at all .
they liked sweet and they would take a bite from the ocean .
i mentioned this to miguel and he did .
he said , &quot; the skin acts like a sponge .
she &apos;s the last ancestor before something in the body .
it &apos;s evolved throughout the evolution of the evolution to look at unpure beliefs . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; but our water has no inbuws . &quot;
okay . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed your fish . a farm that measures your success on success .
and then i realized , if he says , a farm that doesn &apos;t have an uncured , he makes massive , because the water that comes from this farm is from the river of conadaldir .
it &apos;s a river that leads to all the things that are related to the rivers today , which tend to lead to you , chemical pollutants , flow of pest .
and when it fought through the system , and that leaves the water , the water is clean than it is .
the system is so healthy , it cleits water .
so not just a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals , not just a farm that measures their success at the health of their predators , but a farm that &apos;s literally a water plant , not just for those fish , but for you and me .
because if the water flows out , it goes down in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;m going to take it , and you should also do that , because this love story , like romantic , is also emerging .
you could say that you &apos;re a recipe for the future of good food , whether we &apos;re talking about barsh or meat .
what we need now is a radically new concept of agriculture , from one , in the food of the food .
but for many people , this is a little too radical .
we &apos;re not a realistic , we enjoy it . we &apos;re lover .
we love 2000 . we love small family businesses . we talk about local food . we eat organic .
and if you say that the things that are good to reassure the future of the good food is someone in it , and say , &quot; hey , hey , i love pink , but how will you feed the world ?
how are you going to feed the world ? &quot;
can i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like that question .
no , not because we &apos;re producing enough calories to feed the world more than just feeding .
one billion people will starve today .
a billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of crasans in the distribution , not the total production .
now , i don &apos;t like this question because they &apos;ve defined the logic of our food system over the last 50 years .
on the other hand , more grain of plants , harmful startuders on monocultures , chemicals to the earth , chicken to fish , and the whole time , the agricultural industry just said , &quot; if we feed more people cheaper , how awful can be ? &quot;
that was the cause . it was the legal plan . it was the business plan of the american agriculture .
we should call them what it is , a pharmaceutical institution , a pharmaceutical , which is a fast environmental capital , which enables this production .
this is not a industry , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
we &apos;re now threatened by our cornchamber , not due to waste , but due to the resources of resources .
not by the middle ages , and tractor invention , but through fertile land , not pump , but through fresh water , not by pump , but through the forests , and not by fishing , but through fish in the sea .
you want to feed the world ?
let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that are capable of feeding each community ?
to do that , don &apos;t look at the agricultural industrial model for the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
capital , chemistry and machines stand at the top and it has never been a really good thing to eat .
let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
this is what &apos;s happening on two billion years of labor experience .
look at miguel , farmers like miguel .
business , which are not worlds for themselves , businesses , the recreation rather than need to use , to grow , to grow the unisive , rather than just intense , but experts for relationships .
because they &apos;re the ones who are experts for flavor .
and if i &apos;m really honest , you &apos;re a better chef than i ever am .
you know , i &apos;m right , because if that &apos;s the future of good food , it will be delicious .
thank you .
if i want to give you one thing today , it &apos;s that the total of the data that we consume is larger than the sum of their parts , and instead of thinking of information overload , i want you to think about how we can use information and we have become trends that are otherwise not visible .
so , what we &apos;re seeing here is put up a typical chart of age .
the program i use here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called pivot and what i can do with spades is that i can filter after a certain cause of death .
and immediately i see another pattern that makes it happen .
and that &apos;s because in the middle of here , people are the most active and they &apos;re over here on the most sophisticated .
we can go out and get one step further and see the data , and then see that connection and cancer are the usual , but not for everyone .
now if we go on and we &apos;re looking at age 40 years , we &apos;re going to see 40 years or younger , that accidents are even the main thing that people should worry about .
and who cares that this is especially true of men .
so you can see , looking at information and data in this way , in this way in a living information graph .
and if we can do this for raw data , why not use content itself ?
now what we have here is the cover images of every single sport illustrator who have ever been printed .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
you might like to test it for my talk in your rooms .
with spades , they can dive into a decade .
you can live in a certain year .
you can jump directly to a certain copy .
now , when i look here , i see the athletes that appear in this copy and the sporting species .
i &apos;m a lance armstrong fan , so i click on here all of the expenses in which lance is mentioned .
now , if i just want to get a big look , i could think , &quot; ok , what if i look at it all with the topic ? &quot;
so i &apos;m going to step back and get the perspective .
now i see greg lemond .
and so you get an idea that if you look at this kind of information , you &apos;ve got to zoom on this kind of information , zoom , zoom out , zoom out , you don &apos;t look at it .
you do something that &apos;s actually a little different .
it &apos;s something in between and we think it changes the way information can be used .
i want to take this idea a little further with something a little bit crazy .
so what we &apos;ve done here is we &apos;ve taken every one of these unique dimensions , and it &apos;s reduced to a small summary .
and the summary contains a little overview and a symbol of the area that comes from .
i &apos;m just going to show the top 500 of the popular icons .
but even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things .
immediately , we get a sense of the issues that are popular in wikipedia .
i &apos;m going to choose the theme of government .
now , after i &apos;ve chosen &quot; government , &quot; i realize that the wiki formats , which are most of the time , &quot; people of the year are &quot; people . &quot;
this is really important because this is a realization that is not in a single category .
that &apos;s just when you go back and look at the whole thing .
so on a certain of these summaries , i can then go into time magazine , &quot; people of the year &quot; in time , and all together .
now , if i look at all these people , i know that the majority of these are government officers , some of them come from science . some , less , come from the economy . here &apos;s my boss . and one comes from the music area .
and interestingly , bono is also a ted prize winner .
so we can jump and look at all the ted prize winners .
you see , we &apos;re surfing in the web for the first time as if it &apos;s really a network , not just from side to side , but much more abstract .
and so i want to show you what a little surprise might be .
i just show you just the new york times .
pivot , this application -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not a browser , but you can look at websites with it -- and we get this zock technology to every single website like this .
so i can go back one step and jump directly to a specific section .
so this is important because you &apos;re just looking at the websites in this kind of way , all the internet course on the same way .
so i can zoom in in a certain time frame .
here &apos;s the whole demonstration of the whole demonstration i &apos;ve given up .
and i can sort of get everything i &apos;ve seen now , back again .
and , again , if i find out one step and look at everything , i might rearrange my course of looking for my past past . here , i &apos;ve looked for nepotistic , right here , and here &apos;s live labs .
and from here , i can go into the side and call it again .
it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s used again , and every time it does it , it makes the whole picture bigger than the sum of the files .
right now , in this world , we think that data is a flight .
we &apos;re talking about the flight of information .
we talk about drowning in information .
what if we could turn this situation and put the internet on the head , so that instead of going from one to another , we can go from many things to a lot of things , and to see patterns that would otherwise be hidden ?
if we can do this , then that data trap will be a new source of information , maybe a new source of information .
and , rather than moving just in information , we can get knowledge from it .
and if we know , we may even be able to pull away from it .
i &apos;m listening to that , thank you very much .
i grew up with a heroin portion of science fiction .
in my school , i went to school with the bus , every day a trip .
and my nose was always in a book , a science fiction book , which led my mind in other worlds , and in the narentic way my mind in other worlds led to me , unlocked curiosity .
this curiosity also showed that i was always in school when i was not in school through the forests , walked and &quot; samples , &quot; frogs and trucks and bugs and ponds , all after home and underneath the microscope .
i was really excited , you know .
it was always about trying to understand the world and to dissect the boundaries of possible .
and my love to science fiction appeared in my environment , because at the time , in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and exploring the deep sea .
jacques cousteau came in our living room with his fascinating shows that animals and places and a world full of wonder that we could never imagine before .
so that &apos;s really good for the science fiction .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and since there was no video games yet , there were still the video games with computer-generated movies , the whole language in the media landscape , i had to create the images in my head .
that we had all of us at the time , when we read a book as children , we took the description of the line and we put them on the screen in our heads .
my response to this was to draw and paint from aliens , alien worlds , robots , space ships and all kinds of things .
in math education , i was always caught by the teacher , how i was hiding on a book book .
creativity had to somehow figure out .
and something interesting happened . what was fascinated to me , which was fascinated by jacques coustefrom shows , was the idea of a completely unknown world on our earth .
i certainly would never have an alien world with a spaceship world , which seemed to me quite unlikely .
but here was a world i could actually enter here on the earth , and it was just as fascinating and exotic as all that i had imagined , when i read these books .
so i decided that when i was 15 , i would diver .
the only problem was that i lived in a small village in canada , 1,000 miles away from the nearest ocean .
but i didn &apos;t let me get upset .
i got my father , until finally , until he finally did a castle in buffalo , new york , and he had done it on the other side of the border where we lived .
i made my dive in a pool of divination in the middle of the winter in buffalo , new york .
but the ocean , the real ocean , i got to face two years later when we moved to california .
since then , over 40 years , i &apos;ve spent about 10,000 hours , i &apos;ve spent about 10,000 hours of water in diving boats .
and i &apos;ve learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the flat oceans , is so rich , as we really can &apos;t imagine .
the imagination of nature doesn &apos;t know any boundaries , unlike our own human imagination .
until today , i feel deep awe for what i see on my submersible .
and my love for the ocean is going to stop with the same intensity as well as ever .
when i was looking for a job , it was the filmmaker .
that seemed the best way to tell my inner skill , to tell stories , to bring images to me .
as a child , i was constantly drawing comic books and so forth .
so movies were the way to bring pictures and stories together , which fit together .
of course , the stories i was looking for was out of science fiction : &quot; terminator , &quot; &quot; aliens , &quot; and &quot; abyss . &quot;
&quot; hockss &quot; , i was able to do my preference for the underwater world and the gathering with the filmmaker .
so , basically , my two passions .
something interesting happened in the abyss : to solve a narrative in this movie -- and we had to create a kind of liquid water -- we had to create a kind of liquid water -- we built on computer surgery , cg , back .
what came out of that was the first computer surgical interface , which had ever been seen in a movie .
and the film didn &apos;t take money , just frankly , he just played his production cost , but i found something fascinating : the audience on the whole world was being meszed from the magic , which went out of it .
according to arthur clarke &apos;s law , they are known to distinguish more advanced technology and magic .
so they saw something magical .
and i found that incredibly exciting .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that must be involved in the movie art . &quot;
so we went to &quot; terminator 2 , &quot; my next film , much further .
so with ilm , we created the guy &apos;s liquid metal , and the success was very , very much of how this effect would come .
and it worked . again , we created something magical , and the effect in the audience was the same thing , but we &apos;ve had a little bit more money on the film .
from those two experiences , a whole new world has reached a whole new world of creativity for film .
so i started a company with my good friend , 2001 winston , who was at the time of the best mava -- and it was called &quot; digital theft . &quot;
the basic idea of this company was , the phase of analog processes with opmetic pressures , etc .
we then did , and we managed to have a competition for a long time .
but in the middle of the 1990s , we realized that we were in the crease and we design design -- which we actually created the company -- too slow .
i had written this piece of &quot; avatar &quot; that was written in visual effects of visual effects and computer-generated effects in new heights , with realistic human , expressive characters that were made by cg , and the world should be cg . and the world should be cg .
but the bar hit quite nicely , and people in my company told me that we haven &apos;t been able to do that .
so i designed that , and i made this other film about the big ship .
the studio studio , i sold this as &quot; rca and julia on a ship , &quot; and it became a love film , a passionate movie .
but in fact , i wanted to go down to the real wall of the titanic .
that &apos;s why i made the movie .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know .
but i convinced you by saying , &quot; we &apos;re coming to the train . we film the real wall .
we &apos;re going to show it in the opening sequence of the film .
this is hugely important . it &apos;s a good one for marketing . &quot;
and i talked them to fund an expedition .
sounds crazy . but that goes back to that that your imagination can create reality .
we actually created a reality six months later , where i found myself in a russian castle , four miles under the surface of the north atlantic , and i looked at the real titanic through a terror eye .
that wasn &apos;t a movie , no hd , it was real .
so , it really got me working .
and the preparation of this was enormous . we had to build cameras and lights and everything .
and i noticed how much these deep seats , like a space mission .
well , they were also highly technological and highly sophisticated .
you go into this capsule , you &apos;re floating into this dark , hostile environment , where you don &apos;t have hope on saving , if you don &apos;t make it yourself .
and i thought , &quot; wow , this is just as if i was in a science fiction movie .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
i was really obsessed with exploring the deep sea .
anyway , the one with curiosity and science , it was all . it was adventure , it was curiosity . it was imagination .
and it was a experience that i couldn &apos;t give to hollywood .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature that we could create a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i would see outside the window .
in some of the following islands , i saw creatures in thermalsources , and sometimes things that i had never seen before , sometimes things that nobody had seen before , and for the science of science , when we saw them , no words had found .
so that turned me right , and i wanted to get more .
and so i met a little unusual decision .
after the battle of the titanic , i said , &quot; okay , i want to put my main job as a filmmaker in hollywood , and i &apos;m going to put a full-time job for a while . &quot;
and then we started out to the bismarck , and exploring them with robotic witness .
we went back to the library of the titanic .
we took small robots that we built , which was a fiberglass cable .
our intent was to come inside and look at the inside of the ship , which was never before .
no one had ever found the inside of the river . you had no means for it , so we developed the technology .
and i &apos;m sitting there now , on the deck of the titanic , in a castle , and i see a planboat that &apos;s quite similar to these boards , and i know that once the band has played there .
and i fly with a little robotic stuff through the ship of the ship .
i really just like it , but my consciousness is within the vehicle .
it felt like i was physically inside the ship of the titanic of the titanic .
this was the surreal form of a déjstoan vu that i &apos;ve ever experienced , because before i get to a corner of a corner , i always knew what was going on in the light of the car , because i ran months of film for months when we gave the movie .
because the set was an accurate copy of the ship of the ship .
so that was a highly strange experience .
it made me consciously aware of this telepresented experience that you &apos;re using such robotic rabbit and so your consciousness in the vehicle , in those other form of existence .
it was really immensely profound .
and perhaps a small look at what might happen in some decades when you have cyborg bodies to explore something or other things , in all sorts of post-humanments that i can imagine as science fiction .
after these expeditions , we started what we &apos;ve seen down there , really appreciate , for example , for example , that profound source , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals . these are sort of alien standards , but here on earth .
they live with the help of chemosynthesis .
they don &apos;t exist in a sunlight system , as we do .
and so you see animals that are right next to a 500 degrees centigrade that they can survive there .
at the same time , i was also very interested in space science , which was the science fiction of my childhood .
and so i ended up with the people who are interested in space and doing that with nasa , and in a nasa care council , and they &apos;re doing right space missions , and they go back to russia , they go through the mission of the biomedical protopartments , and they go to the international space system , and they take our 3d camera systems .
that was fascinating .
but at the end , it went beyond that i took space scientists into the deep sea .
i took them to give them access to the world at the bottom : astrobiologists , planetary scientists , people who are interested in such extreme situations . i took them to the sources , so they could take samples and test instruments and so on .
we made documentary films , but actually we did science , more specifically , in space science .
so the circle between my existence as a science fiction fan , at the time , as a child , and the implementation of reality .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about this journey .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science , but i &apos;m certainly thinking , you know , a director must also lead , a leader as a ship or something .
but i didn &apos;t understand a lot of leadership before i joined these expeditions .
because at a certain point , i had to say , &quot; what am i doing here ?
why do i do that ? what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
these stupid films don &apos;t bring us money .
we &apos;re going to play the cost of production , of fame .
everybody thinks i &apos;d run out of titanic , and &quot; avatar &quot; by &quot; titanic , &quot; and i &apos;d put it somewhere on a towel on the beach .
i have all these films , these documentary movies , for a very small audience .
no glory , no honor , no money . what are you doing ?
you make it about the task , the challenge -- and the ocean is challenging the most challenging environment , which is there . you make it of discovery , and because of the weird connection that comes when a small group of people form a team .
because we &apos;ve done all this with just 10 to 12 people who have been uninterrupted for years , and sometimes we were two to three months on the sea .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing is that the most important thing you have in front of each other is because you overcome a task that you cannot explain .
if you go back to land and say , &quot; we had to do it , the fiberglass , the sound of noise , and all around that , the whole technology , and the difficulty of the human performance , if you &apos;re working on lake , you can &apos;t explain somebody in common , you know , nobody can explain it .
there &apos;s a connection , a mutual respect .
so when i come back to turn my next film &quot; avatar , &quot; i tried to apply the same leadership style , which is that you make your team feel like that .
it really changed the dynamic .
so i stood again with a little team on unfamiliar terrain , and we made &quot; avatar &quot; with a new technology that was not there before .
incredibly exciting .
an incredible challenge .
and we became an accurate family for a period of four years .
and that changed my way of making films completely .
there were people who said we had really done these ocean creatures really well , and on the planet pandora transported .
for me , it was more appropriate to do my job , the actual process that changed in the outcome .
so what can we get from all of this ?
what lessons do we learn ?
i think , first of all , the curiosity is .
it &apos;s the most powerful human quality .
our imagination is a force that can actually create a reality .
and the prediction of your team is more important than all lorters of this world .
to me , young filmmakers who say , &quot; give me a advice , how i can do something like that . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t limit yourself .
that &apos;s what others get for you . don &apos;t do it yourself yourself , don &apos;t bet yourself , but take risks on you . &quot;
nasa has such a favorite sentence : &quot; failure is not an alternative . &quot;
but in the art and the study , failure has to be an alternative , because it provides a trust .
no need to start , the innovation , the innovation has been tested without the risk .
you have to be willing to take those risks .
this is the thought i &apos;d like to give you on the way . failure is absolutely an alternative , fear is not . thank you .
today i &apos;m talking to you about energy and climate .
and that may surprise you something because my full-time work at the foundation is mainly about vaccines and seeds to make things that we have to invent and deliver to make the poorest 2 billion a better life .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , actually even more important than anybody else on the planet .
climate change means that their satters are not going to grow over many years , and we too do too much , and things are going to change the way their fragile environment cannot be .
that leads to hunger . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to unrest .
so , a climate change is terrible for you .
also , energy is very important for them .
the fact is , if you could reduce only one thing , to reduce the price of poverty , energy is far more effective .
well , the energy rice is over time .
in fact , the progression society is based on energy advances .
the cohlerevolution drive the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a rapid case in the electric age and therefore we have refrigerators , we can make modern materials , and so many things do .
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with power in the rich world .
but , if we reduce the price -- let &apos;s get the price off -- let &apos;s go to a new barrier , and that barrier with co2 .
co2 heating the planet and the equation is actually quite clear .
they put it out of the cutting carbon , which leads to temperature increase , and that temperature increase has some very negative effects . effects on the weather and perhaps worse , the indirects of the natural ecosystems .
now , the exact shape between a carbon increase , and it creates the map of temperature change and where the other consequences are , there are some unpleasant ones , but not very many .
and there are certain clarity of how bad these consequences are going to be , but they will be extremely bad !
i &apos;ve asked the top scientists several times , &quot; do we really have to get down near zero ?
isn &apos;t that enough or a quarter ? &quot;
the answer is , until we get near zero , the temperature will continue to increase .
so it &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different to say , we have a three-foot truck that has to bridge under one foot of three feet . you can sort of put it underneath .
this has to go down very , at zero .
well , we put a lot of carbon dioxide out of , over 26 billion tons .
each americans are about 20 tons . people from poor countries , less than one .
in average , it &apos;s about five tons of everyone on the planet .
and somehow we have to make changes that go down to zero .
it &apos;s constantly up there .
only different economic changes have influenced it , and we need to go from very rapid to reducing the rise of the rise and to a decrease to zero .
this equation has four factors . a little multiorcation , they have this thing on the left -- co2 , which you want to get towards zero , and that will depend on the number of people in average , from the number of people that each person use in the average energy for every service and co2 .
so let &apos;s see every single one of the time , and we think about how we get that on zero .
probably one of these numbers has to come very close to zero .
now this is fundamental algebra , but let &apos;s go through it .
first we have the population .
today , 6.8 billion people live .
and it enters about nine billion dollars to move .
if we &apos;re very successful with new vaccine , the health care and reconstruction medicine , we could reduce that for 10 percent to 15 percent , but at the time we &apos;re looking at 1.3 percent .
the second factor is the services that we use .
this includes all the food we eat , clothing , television , heat .
these are very good things , and the poverty reduction is almost to make these services available to the planet .
it &apos;s great that this number goes up .
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we might be able to discount and use less , but in average , that number of every year , and so on , all the more than double , the number of services will be put on a person .
here we see a very basic service . is there light at home so you can read the homework ?
and these students don &apos;t have it , so they go out and read their school tasks under the street .
now , efficiency , the e , the energy per service , is finally good news .
we have something that &apos;s not rising .
in the light sector , through different successes in the light sector , through new kinds of successes , through new methods , there are a lot of services , and there are a lot of services that are reduced to 90 percent .
in other terms , like the manufacturing of fertilizers , 105 decades : 05 : 55 : 05 : 05 , 05 : 55 , or air traffic or air traffic , it &apos;s a lot smaller .
in total , if we &apos;re optimistic , we may get a reduction to a factor of three or maybe even a factor .
but in the first three factors , we &apos;ve gone from 26 billion tons to maybe 13 billion tons , and that &apos;s not enough .
so let &apos;s take a look at the fourth factor -- and this is going to be a key factor -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 that is emitted per unit of energy .
it turns out whether you can get that on zero .
if you burn coal , no .
if you burn natural gas : no .
it &apos;s almost every manufacturing method for power today , except co2 and nuclear energy .
so what we need to do on a global level is to create a new system .
we need energy wonders .
now , if i use the word &quot; wonder , &quot; i don &apos;t mean the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the pc is a miracle .
the internet and the service is a miracle .
people here have contributed to the development of many of these miracles .
usually there &apos;s no deadline that you need a miracle to a particular date .
usually , you &apos;re just wrong , and some of them are coming , others don &apos;t .
but in this case , we have to give and get a miracle in very short time .
well , i asked myself , how can i really get that ?
is there a natural illustration of evidence , a demonstration that shows people here ?
i remember last year when i got mosquitoes and i kind of liked the people .
the idea was really , you know , that there are people who live with mosquitos .
for energy , i fell here .
i decided that this was going to be free from fireflies to the environment here .
so here are some natural fireflies .
you &apos;ve told me that they don &apos;t bite . they &apos;re not even going to leave the glass .
well , there are all kinds of playful solutions like this , but they don &apos;t get much .
we need solutions , either one or a number of people who have some unimaginable scaling and unimaginable reliable , and even though there are many directions , people are looking for it , i really see five that can afford these big demands .
i &apos;ve made times , geothermal , fusion and biofuel materials .
these may be a modern contribution , and if i expect to expect better than i expect , that &apos;s great , but my core statement here is that we have to go to all five , because they have significant problems , because they have significant problems .
let &apos;s first look at the burning fossil fuels , pull from either coal or natural gas .
what you have to do , maybe , may just be simple , but it &apos;s not . you have to get rid of the co2 that comes out of the burning of the rock .
there are some mushroom projects that make it on a 60 percent -- 80 percent level , but it will be very difficult to get 100 percent very difficult . and a position for the waste of co2 is a big challenge .
who will make sure ?
who can guarantee what literally many billion times greater than any kind of waste you can imagine from nuclear and other things ?
that &apos;s a lot of volume .
so that &apos;s a tough thing .
next : nuclear energy .
it also has three big problems . the cost of , especially in high-verbal countries , are high . the question for security is that you can really feel that nothing can go wrong despite the human race .
and then what do you do with the waste ?
because even though it &apos;s not very large , there &apos;s a lot of concerns .
so three very difficult problems that might be solvable , and that &apos;s why you should work .
the last three of the five .
it &apos;s the renewable energy as they &apos;re often called .
and also , even though it &apos;s great that you don &apos;t need a fuel -- you have a few suggestions .
one is energy energy that makes these technologies dramatically lower than power power .
these are energy dioxide , you talk about a lot of square miles , a thousand times more space than a normal power force .
moreover , these sources are understated .
the sun doesn &apos;t seem the whole day , it doesn &apos;t seem like the wind , it doesn &apos;t seem all the time .
so , if you depend on these sources , you have to have a way to have energy in times when you &apos;re not available .
so there &apos;s big price challenges . there are challenges in transmission , for example , if we say that the source of energy outside the country is , you don &apos;t just need the technology , you have to deal with the risk of where different comes from .
and there &apos;s the wind problem .
and to show you the dimension , i have all sorts of batteries that are made , looking at the cars , computers , mobile phones , for everything . and that &apos;s what i have with the amount of electronic energy , which uses the world that we &apos;re producing now , less than 10 minutes of total energy .
so we need a big breakthrough here , something that will be a factor 100 better than the designs to the time .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
this is what happens when you &apos;re trying to tell these sublolious sources about what we &apos;re talking about , 20 percent of the consumer .
if you want to care about 100 percent , you need an incredible miracle battery .
now , where should we go , what is the right approach ?
&quot; manhattan project &quot; ? how do we get to the target ?
what we need is a lot of companies working on this .
in each one of these five areas we need at least 100 people .
in a lot of them , they say , they &apos;re crazy ! that &apos;s good .
i think there &apos;s a lot of people in the ted group already who are already engaged there .
bill size has several companies , among other people called esolar who has great solar technology .
vinsterkhoa invest in dozens of companies that make great things and interesting possibilities and i try to support it .
nathan myhrvold and i fund a company that , perhaps surprisingly , is reflected in the nuclear approach .
there are some innovations in nuclear space ; modular , liquid .
the development has stopped in this industry some time ago , so it &apos;s not a big surprise that some good concepts are around .
the terrapowerpoint concept means that instead of a part of the ancient , the one percent , the u235 , we decided to burn the 99 percent , the u238 .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , you &apos;ve been thinking about it for a long time , but you could never simulate a reasonable , whether it would work , but since the modern supercomputer is , you can simulate it and see that , yes , it looks like it &apos;s functional .
and because you burn these 99 percent , it &apos;s very much better .
in fact , you burn the waste , and you can actually use the waste of today &apos;s reactors .
instead of breaking on your head , you just burn it . a great thing .
the uranium is used in graduate , a little bit like a candle .
you can see that it &apos;s a kind of column , often as &quot; passenger wave reactor . &quot;
that really solves the fuel problem .
here &apos;s a picture of a place in kentucky .
this is the waste , the 99 percent . you have the part that &apos;s burned today , so it &apos;s called the right uranium .
the motors are the u.s. for hundreds of years .
and when you eat water water , and you just draw it , you get enough fuel for the rest of your life .
you know , there &apos;s a lot of challenges , but it &apos;s an example of many of the challenges that we need to get forward .
let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
how should our testimony look ?
now , let &apos;s go to the destination that we have to reach , and then we talk about the intersections .
many talks from one 80 percent reduction to 2050 .
it &apos;s really important that we get there .
the rest of the 20 percent will be produced in poor countries , and still something agriculture is going to be . hopefully , it &apos;s going to be fine drone and cement until then .
so , to reach these 80 percent , the industrial states have to , including countries like china , their electricity generation completely replaces .
the other note says whether we &apos;re using the zero emissions technology , whether they &apos;re used in all the developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest .
that &apos;s great .
this is going to be a key element .
if we go back from there , how should the 2020 agree ?
it should contain the two elements .
we should use the more effective things to get reduction on the way . the less we measure the less co2 , the less the co2 and the temperature .
but in fact , this note for the things that we &apos;re doing is not completely run to the big reduction , just the same , or even slightly less important than the other ones that are the speed of innovation .
we have to track these breakthroughs with full gas , and we can measure it : in corporate numbers , in a mushroom projects and in the brain .
there are many great books to this topic .
the al gore book &quot; we have the choice , &quot; and david mckays blend the hot energy system . &quot;
they really go through it , and they create a framework in which this can be discussed , because we need to support all sides of all sides .
there are a lot of things that have to come together .
that &apos;s a wish .
a very specific wish for us to invent this technology .
if you just give me a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a vaccine , and i love that , or i could choose this wish , which is , halve energy , without co2 , i wish this wish .
this has the largest effect .
if we don &apos;t get this wish , the dig between the long-term and the short-term people will become terrible , between the united states and china , between poor and rich , between poor and rich , and almost all of those two billion .
so what do we need to do ?
what do i appeal to ?
we need to use for more research funding .
when countries meet in places like copenhagen , they shouldn &apos;t just talk about co2 .
you should talk about these innovation strategy and you would be shocked by the ridiculous ones that are given to these innovative approaches .
we need market incentives , co2 taxes , cap &amp; amp ; trade that creates a price signal .
we need to spread the message .
we have to rationalize dialogue and much more , and also the things that are done by government .
it &apos;s an important wish , but i think we can meet it .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you very much . just to understand something better -- first , can you give us an idea of scale of this investment ?
bill gates : to do the simulation on a supercomputer , to get all the great scientists , what we &apos;ve done , we need only a few 10 million , and even if we tested our materials in a russian reactor to make sure that it &apos;s just in the 100 million .
the difficult step is building the first reactor , to find more billion , to find the ordinary and the location of the first one .
as soon as the first finished , when it goes like that , it &apos;s all very clear , because the economy , the energy energy is so different than we know it .
to understand the right thing : to build deep in the ground , almost like a vertical cup of nuclear fuel , it took it to be a vertical piller , and then the process goes down and works .
bg : right . now , you have to refill the reactor , so there are many people and lots of controls that can go wrong . this thing where you open it and put things in -- it &apos;s not good !
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can fill it for 60 years -- think of a pillar -- that you &apos;re buried without the whole complexity .
and it &apos;s sitting there , and it burns 60 years and then it &apos;s done .
a nuclear reactor , which offers a solution to the garbage .
bg : yeah . well , what happens to the trash : you can put it in -- there &apos;s a lot less waste with this method -- then take it and put it in the next reactor and burn it on .
and we start by taking the waste , which is already , in those refrigerating ponds , or drifting by the reactors , and that &apos;s our starting fuel .
so this is what was a problem for these reactors , which is what we &apos;re going to fill in in our fill with this , dramatically , as this process .
but while they talked to different people in the world about these possibilities .
where is the biggest interest in what &apos;s really going on ?
bg : now we haven &apos;t set ourselves up to a place , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting open rules for everything that &apos;s called the &quot; nuclear &quot; in the name . there &apos;s big interest and people who were in russia , india , china , china , i was here and talked about how to fit energy agenda .
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , french and japanese have done something in the direction .
this is a kind of a thing that was made .
this is an important step forward , but it &apos;s like a faster reactor , and some countries have built this , so everybody who has done a fast reactor for our first .
in your imagination , you have a really probability of calling it into life ?
bg : well , we need one of these scaling , current things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to invent and then spend 20 years .
this is sort of the deadline that shows us the environmental models that we need to hold .
and , you know , terrapower , if everything goes well , and that &apos;s a big wish , could be easy .
and fortunately , there are dozens of companies today , and we need hundreds of others , just as they work , as they work for their pilots , to work for their pilots .
and it would be best if there are several , because then you could use a mixture .
anyway , we need a solution .
you know , the big possible breakthroughs , is this the biggest thing you know ?
bg : one energy breakthrough is the most important thing .
it would have been the environmental demand , but the power of it is so much more important .
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
you know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as these , but there &apos;s the modular method , that &apos;s another approach .
there &apos;s a liquid stream , which seems a little bit difficult , but maybe that &apos;s what it looks like .
and so there are different , but the beautiful thing about it is that it has a million times as much energy as it has , we say , a carbon molecule and therefore , if you can deal with the problems and those are mostly the radiation , the change and other things , almost in your own water .
if that doesn &apos;t work , then what ?
do we need emergency action to try and maintain the earth &apos;s temperature ?
bg : when you get to this situation , it &apos;s like you ate too much , and it &apos;s just a heart attack . what you do is you need a heart operation or something like that .
there &apos;s a research model called geoengineering , which is called the different techniques to delay the warming , so that we &apos;re going to get 20 or 30 years away to come together .
this is just an insurance method .
you hope we don &apos;t need that .
some people say , you shouldn &apos;t be working on insurance , because you might have a bad thing to eat because you know that you &apos;re going to save the heart surgery .
i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s smart , when you get the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s now a discourse in geoengineering about whether you have to get the things faster , or that innovation takes longer than we expect .
climaskepcists : do you have one or two sentences for you to convince you ?
bg : well , unfortunately , the skeptic in very different camps .
those who make scientific arguments are very little .
say that there are negative effects that have to do with the clouds that are moving ?
there &apos;s very , very few things you can tell , from which there is a chance in a million .
the main problem here is just like aids .
you make the mistake now , and you pay a lot later for it .
and so the idea is , now , if you have all kinds of pressing problems to invest in something that you &apos;ve only got -- and that &apos;s where the investment is not so clear . in fact , the ipcc report isn &apos;t necessarily the worst .
the fact is that this uncertainty should make us worry .
but my dream here is that if you can make it economically , and at the same time that the co2 , then the skeptics say , &quot; okay , it doesn &apos;t interest me that it doesn &apos;t release co2 , i wish i &apos;m going to accept it , because it &apos;s cheaper than the previous method . &quot;
and that would be their answer to the bjdnborn lomborg , that if you use all these time and energy to solve the co2 problem , all the other goals suffer , the poverty reduction , the reduction of malaria and so forth that we can do better things that we can do .
bg : well , the actual spending for research -- let &apos;s say the u.s. should spend 10 billion a year than they do today -- that &apos;s not so dramatic .
among them , other things should not suffer .
you come to a big amount of money , and you can talk to reasonable people when you have something that &apos;s not economically , and trying to fund it . most of the waste .
it &apos;s because , you know , you &apos;re very short in front of a cost and funding only the learning curve , and i think we should try more things that have the potential to be much cheaper .
if you go down , you get a very high energy rice , you can only get the rich up .
i mean , every one of us here could spend five times as much for our energy without changing its lifestyle .
but the bottom two billion is a disaster .
and even lomborg thinks about it .
his new maak is now , &quot; why don &apos;t research be spoken anymore ? &quot;
he &apos;s still associated with his former stories , with the skepticism camp , but he understood that this is a very , very common group , and therefore he brings the research argument .
and that &apos;s a thought i think is appropriate .
research , it &apos;s just crazy , how little the benefits are .
bill , i think i &apos;m talking about all the people here , when i say , i really hope your wish will be true . thank you very much .
bg : thank you .
a few years ago , at ted , peter skillman asked a design competition called &quot; the marshmallow challenge . &quot;
the idea is pretty simple . fourth teams have to release the biggest possible structure with 20 telescopes , about 1m tape , about 1m and a marshmallow .
the marshmallow has to be up on top .
and , even though it really seems like it &apos;s really hard , it &apos;s really hard to work with people .
and so i thought that this is an interesting idea , and i turned it into a design workshop .
it was a huge success .
since then , i &apos;ve done about 70 workshops around the world , with students , developers and architects , even with ctos of the mone-50 companies and there &apos;s something that makes deep senes in nature , and i want to share some of them with them .
usually most people start worrying about the task .
you talk about it , you think about how it &apos;s going to look .
then they invest a little bit in planning and organization . they sketch and put spaghetti .
they invest a lot of their time in the building every time .
and finally , just before you don &apos;t have time , someone takes the marshmallow and you put it on top of the top , you step back , and you go back and you say , &quot; ta-da ! &quot; they admire their work .
but then , almost always , what happens is that the ta-da &quot; uh-&quot; is going to be a &quot; uh-oh &quot; because the weight of the marshmallow is that the whole thing is coming down and down .
there &apos;s a series of people who have a lot more &quot; uh-oh &quot; moments than others , and under the worst ones are fresh .
they lie , they cheat , they &apos;re confused and they produce really , really annoying .
and of course , there are teams that have much more &quot; ta-da &quot; shapes , and under the best are fresh students .
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
as peter told us , they didn &apos;t just produce the highest towers , but the most interesting structures of all .
what you might be wondering is , how does this happen ? why about those ?
and peter says , &quot; none of the children invested at the boss of spaghetti gmbh . &quot;
they don &apos;t invest in power fights .
but there &apos;s another reason .
and that is that bwl students were trained to find a real plan , ok !
and then you realize it .
what happens when you put the marshmallow on the top , you don &apos;t have time more and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
what children &apos; garden children do is they start using the marshmallow and building prototypes , successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow on the top of the top , so they have more time to repair the possibility .
constructively recognize this kind of collaboration as the core of a process .
and with each trial , the kids get immediate feedback , which doesn &apos;t work .
so the performance is to work with prototypes , but let &apos;s see how different teams operate .
the average for most of it is about 400 inches , bwl students creating half of them , but not much , children &apos;s garden children are better than adults .
who &apos;s the most successful ?
architects and engineers , for happiness .
1m is the highest thing i &apos;ve seen .
and why ? because they understand triangles and self-replication geometric patterns , the key to build a stable structure .
ceo is something about average . but here it is going to be interesting .
you get an exection administrator on the team , you &apos;re significantly better .
it &apos;s incredible . you look around and you realize , &quot; this team will win . &quot;
you can predict that . why is that ?
because they have special skills of processing .
they run the process , they understand it .
and this team , the law and the work , is the performance of the team significant .
specialized skills and processing skills and its combination leads to success .
if you have 10 teams that are typical , you get about six , which have more stable structures .
i tried something interesting .
i thought , let &apos;s bring it to the same .
so i offered 10,000 dollars to software for the winners .
what happened to these design students ?
what was the result ?
this happened . not a team had a stable structure .
if anyone had built a two-inch construction , he would have carried the prize home .
so is it not interesting that high competition have a strong effect ?
we repeated these practice with the same students .
so what happened ?
now they understood the &quot; prototyping . &quot;
so from the same , bad team of one under the best .
they produced the highest construction in the least time .
so there are deep humility of lessons to us about nature and success .
you might ask : why would someone actually invest a marshmallow to create a marshmallow ?
the reason is , i &apos;m going to create digital tools and processes to help teams , cars , video games , &quot; visual representations . &quot;
and what makes the marshmallow challenge is it helps you identify assumptions .
because frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge gives a common experience , a common language or a foundation to build the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , this simple exercise .
and those of you who are interested in it can visit madagascar .
it &apos;s a blog where you see how to build the marshmallow .
there &apos;s a pac-by-step manual there .
they find crazy examples of all the world , like people to optimize the system and the refined .
there are also economies .
and the base lesson , i think , is actually a commitment sport .
it requires that we have all our senses to focus on the task and that we use our thinking , how our emotions and our doing , in the challenge , the challenge of us .
and sometimes a little prototype of this experience is all it takes to bring us from a &quot; uh-oh &quot; right now .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you .
let &apos;s have a machine here .
a big machine , a cool ted machine , and that &apos;s a time machine .
and everybody in this room needs to go in .
and you can go to the past , you can go into the future ; you can &apos;t stay here and now .
and i wonder what you would choose because i &apos;ve been asking my friends in last time , and they all wanted to go to the past .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back to the time before there was cars or twitter or &quot; america . &quot;
i don &apos;t know .
i believe that somehow you &apos;re kind of drawn to nostalgia .
and i understand that .
i &apos;m not part of that group , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to go to the past , and that &apos;s not because i &apos;m an adventny .
it &apos;s because possibilities don &apos;t go back on this planet , they go forward .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go to the future .
this is the greatest time that we &apos;ve ever had on this planet , no matter what they &apos;re doing : health , wealth , mobility , opportunities , singing disease .
there was never a time before that .
my great-great-grandparents died as they were 60 .
my grandparents raised this number on 70th .
my parents are the 80 .
so there should be better one at the beginning of my death number .
but it &apos;s not about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
a child who &apos;s born in new delhi can expect to live as long as the richest man in the world 100 years ago .
think about it . this is an incredible fact .
and why is that ?
smallpox . smallpox has killed billions of people on this planet .
they reformed the earth &apos;s demographics in a way that no war has ever done .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
we beat them . puff .
in the rich world in the rich world , diseases that have millions of us are even threatened by one generation .
diphtry , roman , child paralysis ...
anyone know what that is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , are successes of scientific method .
and from my view , the scientific method is to try and look at things , if it works , it changes if it doesn &apos;t do that , one of the great achievements of humanity .
so that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , that &apos;s the whole good news , because there &apos;s a few other problems , and they &apos;re often mentioned .
and one of them is that despite all our achievements , a billion people are hungry in this world every day .
that number goes up , and it goes very fast , and that &apos;s embarrassing .
and not only that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to devaforce this world .
drinking water , uranium land , rainbow , gas , gas : they disappear , and if we don &apos;t get out of that chaos , we &apos;re also disappearing , and if we don &apos;t get out of that chaos .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that will feed billions of people , without the country that they live on .
i think we can power this world with energy that they don &apos;t simultaneously destroy .
i really believe that , and no , that &apos;s not a fun thing .
but this keeps me awake at night -- one of the things that wake me up at night . we &apos;ve never taken scientific progress as well .
and we &apos;ve never been able to put it directly in the way that we can do it today .
we &apos;re at the threshold of amazing , amazing events , and yet i really think that we have to go back hundreds , 300 years before the enlightenment , to find a time in which we have progress in progress , more frontal than now .
people are screaming in their faith , and that &apos;s so deeply , you can &apos;t free them .
not even the truth will be free .
and listen , everyone has a right to be on his mind ; even a right on his opinion .
but you know what you don &apos;t have right ?
you don &apos;t have a right on your own facts . &apos; &apos; guilt , you don &apos;t have them .
and i took a while to find out .
about a decade ago , i wrote an article about vaccination for the new yorker , a little article .
and i was amazed to escape resistance , based on what is the most effective thing in health care history in human history .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i just did what i always do , i wrote an article and drove on .
and soon , i wrote an article about genetic food .
same thing , just bigger .
people were playing nuts .
so i wrote an article written about this , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that would be &quot; frankenfood , &quot; why they thought molecules were going around a specific way around the area of nature .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i continued .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
we type , we pass one , we go to food , that &apos;s okay .
but this article made me worry , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and finally i found it .
and that &apos;s because these fanagues made me crazy at all .
these were relucent people , educated people , engaging people .
they were just like people in this room .
and that got me so upset .
but then i thought , you know what , let &apos;s be honest .
we are at a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress as we used to .
we &apos;re talking about it .
we &apos;re talking about what we &apos;re talking about is , &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , there &apos;s reasons , and i think we know what the reasons are .
we have trust in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science , and there &apos;s no reason why it shouldn &apos;t be that way .
you can just call it a few names , and people will understand .
chernobyl , bhopal , the challenger , vioxx , mass weapons , the u.s. presidential election .
i mean , you know , you can pick your own list .
there are questions and problems with people that we believed that they were always right . so be skeptical .
now , imagine , you ask the evidence , demand evidence .
don &apos;t take anything like that .
but now , if you have to get evidence , you have to take that evidence , and we &apos;re not good at that .
and i can tell you that we &apos;re now living in an epidemic of fear , like i &apos;ve never seen , and hopefully never see them again .
about 12 years ago , a story was published , a terrible story that had autism epidemic with the masites , muders , and roman vaccine .
very scary .
the other studies were done to see if this was true .
in fact , studies should be done ; that &apos;s a serious issue .
the data came in .
the data came in from the united states , from england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all the same , no correlation , no connection , no connection .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference . it doesn &apos;t make any difference because we believe in anecdotes , we believe what we see , what makes us feel really , that we feel real .
we don &apos;t believe in a school documents of a government who gives us data , and i understand that i think we all do .
but you know what ?
the result of this was catastrophic .
because of this fact , the united states is one of the only countries in the world where vaccinators go down for masconductors .
this is scandal and we should be ashamed .
it &apos;s terrible .
what happened is we could do that .
well , i understand that . i do .
because here &apos;s a guy here ?
has one ever seen anyone in the audience die ?
not very often .
it &apos;s happening in this country at all , but 160,000 times the world in the last year .
these are a lot of deaths through masenas , 20 per hour .
but because this is not what &apos;s happening here , we can , and people like jenny mccarthy can walk around and talk about fear and illiterate and larry king of platforms like oprah and larry king .
and you can do that because you don &apos;t connect the cause and texture .
you don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be equal , but almost never the same .
and that &apos;s something we need to learn , and that &apos;s very fast .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .
he liberated us from one of the worst minds of humanity .
no fear , no offensal , children , puff , disappeared .
the guy in the middle isn &apos;t so much .
he &apos;s called paul offit .
he just developed a couple of other people with a rotavirus vaccine .
he can save the lives of 400- , 500,000 children a year in the developing world .
pretty good , isn &apos;t it ?
now , that &apos;s good , except that paul &apos;s walking around and talking about vaccines and says how valuable they are , and that the people should stop .
and he actually says that .
so paul is a terrorist .
if paul talks in a public attack , he can &apos;t talk to no guns .
he gets calls at home because people like to tell him that they know where his children go to school .
and why ? because paul did a vaccine .
i don &apos;t need to say that , but vaccines are inadequate .
you take them on , they return the diseases , terrible diseases , and this is happening .
we now have masenas in this country .
and that gets worse , and pretty soon , children will die again , because that &apos;s just a question of numbers .
and they &apos;re not going to be dead .
what about children &apos;s paralysis ? do we . why not ?
one of them in me has written me a few weeks ago , and i said , i &apos;m a little bit too sharll .
nobody ever said that before .
she wouldn &apos;t vaccinate her kid against children &apos;s paralysis . no matter .
fine .
why ? because we don &apos;t have children &apos;s paralysis , and you know what ?
we had no children in this country yesterday .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe someone in lagos has a plane , and it &apos;s going to los angeles , right now , it &apos;s about ohio .
and in a few hours , he &apos;s going to land and rented a car , and he comes to long beach , and he &apos;s going to visit one of these fantastic fellows tonight .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a paralyzing disease , and we don &apos;t know that , because the world is now working .
that &apos;s the planet that we live on . don &apos;t do that as if it &apos;s not .
we love to lie in lying . we love that .
did you have all your vitamins in this morning ?
echinacea , a small antioxidantium , which helps you to do it .
i know they did that because half the americans do it every day .
they take the stuff , and they take alternative cure , and it doesn &apos;t matter how often we find that they are useless .
the data is constantly taking it .
they break their ures . they almost never do .
this is okay , they want to pay 28 billion dollars to dark urnumbers .
i agree with you .
dark urine . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
well , i think i understand -- we hate the pharmaceutical industry .
we hate too strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
and we should not . our healthcare system is mies .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely amazing , and it &apos;s starving itself to us that can afford .
so we run away , and where do we walk ?
we &apos;re running into the poor of the placebo industry .
this is great . i love the placebo industry .
but you know , that &apos;s really a serious thing , because the stuff is crap , and we give billions of dollars to it .
and i have all kinds of little props here .
kone of them -- gingko , it was echinacea , it was acai , i don &apos;t even know what that is , but we give billions of dollars to do it .
and you know what ? if i say that , people scream me and say , &quot; what does it take you ? let &apos;s do what you want . &quot;
that &apos;s how they feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? you &apos;re wrong .
because it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s a minister of health , it says , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m not going to accept the evidence of my experts , &quot; or any cancer source that wants to treat his patients with kaffe .
if you go to this path , where and magic and magic allows you and science , you get to a place where you don &apos;t want to be .
you get to thabo mbeki in south africa .
he brought about 400,000 of his people , because he was the fact that red beebs , bone , and lemon oil , are much more effective than antiretroviral drugs that we know that they can take over the course of aids .
hundreds of thousands of unnecessarily death deaths in a country , which is worse than any other of this disease .
don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences .
they have them . they &apos;ve always got them .
now , the world &apos;s largest epidemic , in which we &apos;re right now , is this absurde fight between the fear of legal food and the bio-elite .
this is an igram debate . it has to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
this is ideology , not science .
all we eat is every branch , every branch , every branch , every ropers , was changed by the people .
you know , there was no client in paradise .
there were no cantaloues .
there was no christmas trees . we did it all .
we did it in the last 11,000 years .
and some of them worked and they don &apos;t work .
we got rid of what didn &apos;t work .
now we can do it more specifically , and of course there are risks , but we can do something like vitamin a in rice , and the stuff can help millions of people , millions of people live .
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
i have to say that i don &apos;t understand .
we reject food .
why do we do that ?
now , what i hear is , too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , monoculture , we don &apos;t want huge fields with one thing , that &apos;s wrong .
we don &apos;t want companies to patent life .
we don &apos;t want companies to have seeds .
and you know what my answer to all of this is ?
yeah , you &apos;re right . let &apos;s fix it .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge food problem , but it &apos;s not science .
this has nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s right , morality , patent stuff .
you know , science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works and sometimes not , but the idea that we shouldn &apos;t allow science to do , because we fear it is a real dead , and it holds millions of people off the reduction .
you know , in the next 50 years we &apos;re going to have to grow 70 percent more food than in the moment . 70 percent .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
shame . damage .
they need that , and we don &apos;t give it .
and why ? well , genetically modified food .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this fine stuff like maniok .
maniok is something that &apos;s half a billion people eat .
it &apos;s about a marker .
it &apos;s just a bunch of calories . it &apos;s mies .
it doesn &apos;t have nutrients ; it doesn &apos;t have protein , and scientists are building all this .
and then people could eat it and wouldn &apos;t be blind .
they wouldn &apos;t starve , and you know what ?
that would be nice . it wouldn &apos;t be cheom , but it would be nice .
and all i can say is , why do we fight this ?
i mean , are we asking , why do we fight this ?
because we don &apos;t want to push around .
it &apos;s not about pulling around genes . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our bodies on greater food , better food , better food .
it &apos;s not about rice crises reed , it &apos;s about getting people alive , and it &apos;s going to be the highest time to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we don &apos;t do that , if we continue to do that as far as we are doing , i think we don &apos;t want to be guilty , i think , high-tech colonialism .
there &apos;s no other description for what &apos;s happening here .
it &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s our unconscious , and we have to really stop that .
so after this incredibly funny conversation , you might want to say , &quot; are you still going to go into this ridiculous machine and go to the future ? &quot;
anyway . that &apos;s what i want to do .
it &apos;s right now in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can put this machine on everything we want .
we can move them where we want to move them , and we will move them where we want .
we need to lead these conversations , and we need to think , but if we go to the time machine , we &apos;ll be happy to have that .
i know we can , and as far as it is , it &apos;s something that the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
i &apos;ve been interested in the placebo effect for a while , and it may seem strange that a magician is interested in it , because they look like i am , &quot; a deception , if somebody just believes it . &quot;
in other words , sugar pills , in some studies , have shown a measurement effect , the placebo effect , and it &apos;s just because the person thinks what happens to you , is a pharmaceutical or a kind of ...
a deception becomes something to something , because somebody is so comfortable .
so we also want to understand each other , i want to show you a very basic , very simple magic trick .
and i &apos;m going to show you how he works . this is a trick that &apos;s at least since the 1950s in any magic book for children .
i even learned him from cub scout magic of the paths in the 1970s .
i &apos;m going to do it for you and explain it .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i &apos;ll explain it .
so , look what happens .
the knife you can study , my hand , that you can study .
i &apos;m just going to hold the knife in my arms .
i &apos;m going to go back my sleeve .
and to make sure that nothing in my sleeve disappears or out of it , i &apos;ll just push my wrist right here .
in this way , you can see that no one &apos;s moving at any time , as long as i press here , nothing can go to my sleeve or come out .
and the goal is very simple .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully , if everything goes well , the knife will be taken through my blog physical magnetic pulse .
it &apos;s actually so clear to his place that i can shake it without the knife falling down .
nothing goes out into my sleeve or comes out , no coincidence . and you can study everything .
ta-da !
now , this is a trick that i often teach young kids who are interested in magic , because you can learn a lot about deception when you look at a very simple trick .
probably many of you have seen this trick in the room .
it works like this .
i think the knife in my hand .
i say i &apos;m going to take my wrist to make sure that nothing in my sleeve disappears or out , and that &apos;s a lie .
the reason i stick my wrist is that there &apos;s the real secret of illusion .
because at the moment , where i turn my hand away , so you can see it moving from the back , this finger is moving here , my time finger , just from where he was , in a position that he was so tied .
great trick ?
there &apos;s somebody in the back there who had no childhood .
so , he &apos;s here . right .
and when i turn around , the fingers changes its position .
and now you could talk about why this is a deception , why you don &apos;t realize that there are only three fingers at the bottom here : because the mind and the way it processes information , it doesn &apos;t count , one , two , three , it &apos;s as a group .
but that &apos;s not what it &apos;s about , and then i open my hand .
of course , there &apos;s going to be , of course , but not by the magnetism of my body , but by a trick , through my time , which is now .
and if i close my hand , the same thing happens by turning back through this movement , that the fingers will move back .
i take this hand away . and here &apos;s the knife .
this trick can show you their friends and neighbors . thank you .
now , what does this have to do with the placebo effect ?
a year ago , i read a study that really came out of me .
i &apos;m not a doctor or researcher , and that &apos;s why i was an amazing thing .
because it turns out that if you offer a placebo in the form of a white pill , in the form of an idiot , it &apos;s just a round , white pill that has a particular effect .
but if you give the shape in which they give the placebo , for example , in a smaller pill , and that blue color , and a letter , it &apos;s actually measurable .
and that , although not any pharmaceutical ... it &apos;s just sugar pills .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
what ? that was what i did .
but it turns out that it &apos;s not all that .
if you take capos , you &apos;re more effective than a pill of any form .
a colored capsule that is at an end yellow and the other red is better than a white capsule .
also , the dodo plays a role .
a pill is not as good as three pills a day -- i can &apos;t remember the right statistics . i &apos;m sorry .
but the key thing is , ...
... that also matters a role .
and the shape is a role .
and if you want to have the ultimate score , you have to reach the needle .
right ? a syringe with an effective -- a few milliseconds of an effective substance that you inject a patient .
it creates a very strong picture in your head . it &apos;s a lot stronger than a white pill .
this chart is really -- i &apos;m going to show you a different time when we have a projector .
so in fact , the white pill doesn &apos;t work as well as the blue pill that doesn &apos;t work as well as a capsule that doesn &apos;t work as well as the needle .
and none of it has any really pharmaceutical property . it &apos;s just our belief in creating a stronger effect .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
i take something that &apos;s obviously a deception , and let it look real .
we know from the study that you have to reach the needle if you want to go to the thing .
this is a 18 inches long . it &apos;s very , very high . and i &apos;m going to give you a little bit of a bit of a bit .
this is really my meat . it &apos;s not damartious meat .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
i &apos;m going to stick this needle in my skin , and i &apos;ll stick through it , until you put it on the other side .
if you &apos;re bad , if you &apos;re going to fall out of ozone -- i &apos;ve taken a couple of friends last night in the hotel room , and some people that i didn &apos;t know , and i &apos;ve become a woman &apos;s powerful .
so i &apos;m suggesting that if you &apos;re very lucky , you &apos;re looking for the next 30 seconds , or , you know what , i &apos;m going to do the first one in the back here .
you can see it right now , but you can also see away if you want .
so , it &apos;s like that , right here , where my flesh starts , i &apos;m just going to make a little one-fold .
i &apos;m sorry . do you do that crazy ?
and just a little bit of a little bit of my skin and on the other side .
now we &apos;re actually in the same situation that we had in the same situation .
about .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
so , i &apos;ll show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well , yeah .
i know what people think when they see this .
they say , &quot; okay , it &apos;s certainly not so stupid , and it turns out the skin , just to talk to us for a few minutes . &quot;
well , i &apos;ll show you .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and people in the back say , &quot; okay . i haven &apos;t seen that right . &quot;
people are coming in the side room now .
let me show you a little bit close .
it &apos;s really my skin . it &apos;s not a special effect of hollywood .
this is my flesh , and i can rotate this .
sorry . if you &apos;re bad , look away , don &apos;t look at it .
people back in the back or the one that you see eventually on video , will say , &quot; well , this is quite impressive , but if it &apos;s real , it would look pretty impressive , but if it really would be , it would be a hole and there if it really would be real . &quot;
okay , let me put a little blood out for you .
yeah , here it is .
i normally would take the needle out .
i would drop my arm and show you that there are no wounds .
but i think in this frame here , and with the intention of doing something real , i &apos;m going to just leave the needle there and go from the stage .
we &apos;re going to meet a couple of times in the next few days .
i hope you &apos;re enjoying yourself . thank you very much .
everybody talks about happiness today .
i have some people counting the number of books that were published with &quot; happiness &quot; in the last five years , and they gave about 40 , and there was a lot more .
there &apos;s a tremendous wave of interest in happiness among researchers .
there &apos;s a lot of happiness coaching .
everybody would love to make people happier .
but despite all this tide of work , there are several cognitive breaks that make it almost impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk today is mostly going to act by this cognitive .
that &apos;s true for salmon , thinking about your own happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists who think about happiness , because it turns out that we are just like everybody else .
the first of these falls is a disagreement , embracing complexity .
it turns out that the word happiness is simply not a useful word because we apply it to too many different things .
i think there &apos;s a certain meaning that we could limit it to , but in large and all that is something that we need to give up , and we &apos;re going to have to take the complicated view of what well-being is .
the second trap is a change of experience and memory : basically , it &apos;s between happiness in its life and happiness about his life , or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both together in the imagination of happiness .
and the third is concentrations illusion , and that &apos;s the happy fact that we can &apos;t think about a fact that affects well-being , without its significance .
i mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
now , i &apos;d like to start with one example of someone who had a questione-answer meeting after one of my lectures , who came up with a story . &#91; unclear &#93; he said he &apos;d heard a symphony , and it was absolutely gorgeous music , and at the end of the recording , there was a terrible circle of noise .
and then he added , really quite emotional , that ruins the whole experience .
but it didn &apos;t .
what it had ruined was the memories of the experience .
he had the experience .
he had had 20 minutes old music .
they didn &apos;t go because he was loving a memory ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was everything he had to keep .
what that really tells us is we might think about ourselves and other people in the sense of two types of self .
there &apos;s a living self living in the present , and the present wisdom is capable of experiencing the past , but essentially the present has .
it &apos;s the living self , the doctor &apos;s doctor -- you know , when the doctor asks , &quot; well , it hurts now , when i put it here ? &quot;
and then there &apos;s a remind itself , and the repetition itself is that , and the story of our life is getting upright , and it &apos;s given the story of our life , and it &apos;s that the doctor says , &quot; how did you feel lately ? &quot;
or &quot; how was your journey to albania ? &quot; or something like that .
these are two very different units , the living self and the recall itself , and the two is part of the process of happiness from happiness .
well , the memory itself is a storyteller .
and that really starts with a fundamental response to our memories -- it starts immediately .
we don &apos;t just tell stories when we &apos;re doing it to tell stories .
our memory tells us stories , which is what we can keep from our experience a story .
and let &apos;s start with an example .
there &apos;s an old study .
these are real patients that are undertaking a painful procedure .
i &apos;m not going to go to the details . it &apos;s not painful today , but it was painful when this study was done in the 1990s .
they were asked to report every 60 seconds about their pain .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
and they &apos;re asked , &quot; who &apos;s suffered more ? &quot;
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
patient b clearly suffered more . his gut reflection was longer , and every minute of pain , the patient had patient b , and more .
but now there &apos;s another question : &quot; how much did these patients think they suffered ? &quot;
and here &apos;s a surprise .
and the surprise is that patient a much higher remembered had a much higher memory than patient b.
the stories of pearl reflection were different , and because a very important part of the story is how they ends .
and none of these stories is very sophisticated or great -- but one of them is that clear .
but one of them is clearly worse than the other .
and the worse is where the pain was at the end of its peak . it &apos;s a bad story .
how do we know ?
because we asked these people after their gut reflection , and also much later , &quot; how bad was the whole thing ? &quot;
and she was much worse for a while in the memory .
well , this is a direct conflict between the living self and the memory itself .
from the living self , b clearly had a bad time .
now , what you could do with patient a , and we actually did clinical experiments , and it &apos;s been done , and it &apos;s going to work , you could actually increase the gut mirror of patient a by simply taking the tube into it .
that will lead to the patient , but only a little bit and a lot less than before .
and if you do that for a few minutes , you can do that that the living self is a bad thing , and you have power that the memory itself is much better , because now you &apos;ve got a better story about your experience .
what is a story for ?
and that &apos;s true for the stories that make memory , and it &apos;s also true of the stories that we invent .
what a story is about , it turns out , is significant eyelook and end .
they &apos;re very , very important , and in this case dominated the end .
well , the living self lives alive .
it has moments of life , one after another .
and you ask : what happens to these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re always lost .
i mean , most eye looks of our lives -- and i have this -- you know , the psychological present is about three seconds long , which means you know that there &apos;s about 600 million of them . most of you have no trace . most of you don &apos;t have any trace .
most of you are completely ignored by the memory itself .
and yet , somehow they get the impression that they should count that what &apos;s happening during the eye of life is our lives .
it &apos;s limited resource that we consume during this world .
and as we &apos;re going to use it , it seems to be important , but that &apos;s not the story that reminded itself .
so we have reminded ourselves , and the living self , and they &apos;re really quite different .
the biggest difference between them is the relationship with time .
from the living self , if you have a holiday and the second week is just as good as the first one , then the two-week holiday is twice as good on vacation .
that &apos;s not how it works at all .
for the remember , a two-week vacation is barely better than the one-week vacation , because there are no new memories .
they didn &apos;t change the story .
and in this way , time is actually the critical variable that is different from a living self . time has very little influence on this story .
well , the memory itself does more than to remember and tell stories .
it &apos;s actually , in fact , the decisions that make decisions , because if you have a patient who had , say , two coles in two different surgeons , and decides what he &apos;s supposed to choose , then it &apos;s the one that &apos;s going to be the memory that is selected , and that &apos;s the surgeon who will be selected .
the living self has no voice in this election .
in fact , we don &apos;t choose between experience . we choose between memories of experiences .
and even if we think about the future , we don &apos;t usually think of our future as experiences .
we think about our future as a prediction .
and in fact , you can look at this , you know , as a fisherage of remind itself , and you can think of it as one , which is the kind of living self that doesn &apos;t need the living self .
i &apos;ve got the impression that if we &apos;re doing a holiday that &apos;s very often the case , that means we &apos;re going to make holiday in the service of the mind .
and that &apos;s a bit hard to justify , i think .
i mean , how much are we from our memories ?
this is one of the explanations that is given to the dominance of mind itself .
and when i think about it , i think about a holiday that we did a few years ago in antarctica , which was clearly the best vacation that i had ever had , and i think relatively often in the relationship of how often i think of others .
and i probably have my memories of this three-week journey , i would say about 25 minutes in the last four years .
now , if i had ever opened the folder with the 600 pictures in it i &apos;d spent another hour .
well , these are three weeks , and these are just a half hours .
there seems to be an unconsistent thing .
now , i like to be a little extreme , you know , how little appetitions i have on the zeber of memories , but even if you have more of it , why do we give a real question to it ?
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
imagine your next holiday , you know that at the end of the vacation , all of your images are lost and you get a amnestic drug , so you &apos;re not going to remember anything .
now , would you choose the same holiday ?
and if you &apos;re going to pick another holiday , there &apos;s a conflict between two types of self and you &apos;ve got to think about how you choose this conflict and that &apos;s really not obvious at all , because when you think of time , you might get an answer .
why we choose the vacation that we choose is a problem that represents us with a choice between the two kinds of self .
now , the two types of self throw two terms of happiness .
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can apply , one of ourselves .
so you can ask : how happy is the living self ?
and then you would ask : how happy are the eyebrosts in life of the living self ?
and they &apos;re all -- happiness is a pretty complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
and , by the way , we &apos;re now able to get a pretty good idea of the happiness of the living self .
if you &apos;re lucky , it &apos;s a very different thing .
it &apos;s not about how happy a person lives .
it &apos;s about how happy or delighted is the person when this person thinks about their lives .
very different term .
anyone who &apos;s not different is the study of happiness , and i &apos;m in a lot of researchers , and i &apos;m standing in a lot of researchers who have the study of happiness for a long time .
the distinction between happiness itself and happiness has been recognized in the last few years , and now you &apos;re trying to measure the two separate ones .
the gallup organization has a global survey , where more than half a million people have been asked about what they think about their lives and their experiences , and there were other efforts in the direction .
so in the last few years we started learning about the happiness of the two kinds of self .
and the main lesson that we think i learned is that they really are different .
you can know how happy someone is with his life , and it doesn &apos;t really teach you how happy he lives alive and vice versa .
just to give you a sense of the fossil composition that is about five .
what that means is that if you would meet somebody and you would say , oh , his father is a two-meter man , how much would you know about his size ?
well , you would know something about its size , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
if i tell you that somebody has been in a scale of 10 , they have a lot of uncertainty about how happy it is with its own .
so the correlation is small .
we know something about what happiness does for happiness .
we know that money is very important to develop goals .
we know happiness mostly means being satisfied with people that we like to spend time with people that we like .
there &apos;s other pleasure , but that &apos;s the dominant .
so if you want to maximize those two types of self , you will do very different things .
the implication of what i said here is that we shouldn &apos;t really think of happiness as a replacement for well-being .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
now , very briefly , another reason we can &apos;t think about happiness is that we don &apos;t pay attention to the same things if we think about life and if we actually live .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people are in california , they don &apos;t get the correct answer .
if you ask that question , people have to be happier in california if they say , in ohio .
and what happens is that if you think about life in california , think about the difference between california and other places , and that difference is , we say , in climate .
well , it turns out that climate is not very important for the living self , and it &apos;s not even very important to the self that decides how happy people are .
but now , because it &apos;s responsible itself , you can at the end -- some people could go to california .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to pursue what happens to people who go to california in hope , getting happier .
well , you &apos;re not going to be happier .
we know that .
but one thing is going to happen . you &apos;re going to think that you &apos;re happier , because if you &apos;re going to think about it , you &apos;re going to remember how awful the weather was in ohio . and you &apos;re going to feel the right decision .
it &apos;s very hard to think about well-being , and i hope i &apos;ve given you a sense of how hard it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question for you .
thank you .
now , when we did a couple of weeks ago , they talked to me that there was a pretty interesting outcome that came out of this period survey .
is that something you can be involved in , because now you have a few minutes left ?
daniel kahneman : sure .
i think the most interesting result that we found in the gallup survey is a number that we didn &apos;t expect to find .
we found that in terms of happiness itself .
if we looked at how feelings interact with income .
and it turns out under a income of 60,000 dollars a year , americans , and that &apos;s a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a big representative sample , under a 40-0,000 dollars a year .
60,000 .
dk : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars a year , people are unhappy , and they &apos;re increasingly unhappier , the more they will .
we get an absolutely flat line .
i mean , i rarely saw that flat lines .
what happens is obviously that money is not a experience happiness , but that lack of money is certainly a misery , and we can measure this misery very , very clearly .
in the sense of another self , the memory itself , they get a different story .
the more money you deserve for it .
it &apos;s not for emotions .
but danny , in the entire american pursuit , it &apos;s about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
if people would take that fund seriously , i mean , it seems to be all on the head , everything we believe in , for example , on tax policy and so on .
is there a chance that politicians , the country generally would take a fund like the serious and would make policy based on politics ?
dk : you know , i think there are recognition for the role of money in politics .
the recognition is going to be slow in the united states , no question , but in the united kingdom , it &apos;s happening right now in other countries .
people are in order to realize that they should think of happiness as they think about politics .
it &apos;s going to take a while , and people will discuss whether they want to study the experience happiness or whether they want to study life review , so we have to start this discussion quite soon .
how to raise happiness is very different from how you think and whether you think about it yourself or whether you think about it yourself .
that &apos;s going to affect politics , i think , in the next few years .
in the united states , you have to measure the experience happiness of the population .
this will be , i think , in the next one or two decades of the national statistic .
well , it seems to me , this issue , or should at least be the most interesting political debate to pursue the next few years .
thank you very much for the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you , danny kahneman .
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal . i throw video games .
now i &apos;ve been developing online games for 10 years , and my goal for the next decade is to make it just as easy to save the world in reality as you &apos;re in online games .
i have a plan for this . i want to convince people , including all of them , more time to spend more and bigger games .
we &apos;re currently spending three billion hours a week with online play .
some of you may think , &quot; this is a whole lot of time for games . &quot;
maybe something too much time , if you consider how many problems we have to solve in the real world .
but in fact , my research at the institute for the future is exactly the opposite .
three billion hours a week , not nearly enough to solve the pressing problems of the world .
in fact , i &apos;m convinced that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to increase that time dramatically .
i &apos;ve calculated that the cost required at 21 billion hours a week .
this may seem a little bit counterintuitive , so again , i can make it work : if we &apos;re hungry , poverty , climate change , global conflict and obesity , i think we need to try to play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week to the end of the next decade .
no , i mean it really seriously .
why ? this image describes very precisely why i think games are so essential to the survival of human species in the future . seriously .
this is a portrait of the photographer phil toledano .
he wanted to capture the feelings of play , so he was building a camera .
this is one of the classic expressions of play .
if you &apos;re not a player , maybe you &apos;re going to get some of the more nuanctions in this picture .
you &apos;re probably seeing this sense of urgency , something fear , but also the first concentration of concentration , it &apos;s very difficult to solve .
if you &apos;re playing , you &apos;re looking at some more nuanctions here , looking up , and the mouth is a sign of optimism . the eyebrows show surprise .
this is a player who &apos;s on the edge of a book called epic sieges .
oh , you know this . ok . prima . so we have some players here .
a epic victory is a result that is so highly positive that they didn &apos;t know that it was possible at all .
it was beyond the imagination .
and if you reach it , you &apos;re shocked that you &apos;re actually able to do something like that . that &apos;s a epic victory .
this player is short of a epic victory .
and this is what we need to see on a million faces from problem-solving all over the world , if we put the hurds in the next century , the face of the next century , the face of all expenses on the edge of a epic seal .
well , unfortunately , we see this face in real life when we face hard problems .
i call it the &quot; in life i am bad . &quot; and it &apos;s actually my face , you see ? yes ? ok .
this is me , as i am in life , &quot; face . &quot;
this is a graffiti in my former home in berkeley , california , where i studied why we are in games better than in the real life .
this is a problem that many players have .
we think we &apos;re not so good in the reality of play .
and i don &apos;t mean just less successful , even though it &apos;s that .
we reach more in game worlds . i mean good in relation to motivation , something significant to do with each other .
if we &apos;re in a game in a game , i believe that many of us will transform in our best version , every time we &apos;re ready , we &apos;re trying to solve the problem , to try and solve it as long as necessary .
and in reality , if we fail to make failure , we feel often different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel defeated . we feel threatened . we feel threatened , maybe depressed , frustrated or cynic .
we &apos;ve never got these feelings , if we play games , they &apos;re just not in play .
and this is what i wanted to study as a ph.d.
why is it impossible in games to think , you could not just do anything ?
how can we apply these feelings to reality ?
so i looked at games like world of warcraft , which leads the ideal environment to the communal problem .
and i &apos;ve found some things that the epic wins in online worlds can make .
so , first , if you &apos;re going in one of these online games , especially in world of warcraft , there &apos;s a lot of different characters that are willing to trust you , and it &apos;s immediately .
but not just any mission , but a mission that fits perfect to your current level , right ?
so they create that .
you never get a job that you can &apos;t solve .
but always on the edge of their capabilities , so they have to work hard , but there &apos;s no unemployment in the world of warcraft .
you don &apos;t sit around , and it turns out there &apos;s always something important to do .
and there &apos;s a lot of staff .
where they go , hundreds of thousands of people who work with them to close their epic mission .
we don &apos;t have that in the real life that we have in the real life , that feeling that , in a finger , you &apos;re willing to stand in a finger .
and also , there &apos;s this epic story , this inspiring story , why we are there and what we have to do .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
you &apos;ve probably heard of &quot; level up &quot; and &quot; + 1 strength &quot; or &quot; + 1 intelligence . &quot;
this constant feedback is not in real life .
if i leave this stage , i don &apos;t have a talk , and i &apos;ve got a crazy idea , and i have 20 crazy idea , and 20 crazy idea .
i don &apos;t get into the real life of this feedback .
so , the problem of cooperative online worlds like world of warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying to stand at any time on the edge of a epic sieges that we should spend our entire time in these toys .
they &apos;re just better than reality .
until today , all the world of warwing players have spent 5.93 million years trying to solve the virtual problems of adioth .
it &apos;s not a bad thing .
it may sound cool .
but to see it in the context , five 93 million years ago , our first primatenancestors started walking upright .
so the first exciting primate .
ok , so if we talk about how much time we spend at play , it just makes sense when you think about the time in terms of the magnitude of human development , which is extraordinarily important .
but also , because it turns out we &apos;re using this whole time to play this whole time , actually , what we &apos;re able to do as humans in the situation .
we &apos;re developing together more collaborative , thanks creatures .
that &apos;s the truth . i believe that .
if you look at this interesting statistic , which was published recently by a researcher of carnegie mellon university : the average boy of today spends 10,000 hours in a country with huge toys with online play .
so , 10,000 hours is an extremely interesting number of reasons .
first of all , for kids in the united states , 10.080 hours are the exact equivalent of all that they spend in school , from the fifth grade to the degree of high school -- if you never miss .
so here we have a complete parallel of education , on the young people learning what it means to be a good player , how everything else you learn in school .
and maybe some of you have the new book of malcolm gladwell , &quot; overflips , &quot; read .
so you know his theory of success , the theory of the success of 10,000 hours .
it &apos;s based on the great research of cognitive science that , if we spend 10,000 hours on the table of any subject to the 21st of the year , we &apos;re going to master it .
we &apos;re going to be so good at what to do , as the most important people in the world .
so what we have here is a whole generation of young people who are mastering players .
so the big question is , &quot; what exactly are players doing ? &quot;
because if we could figure out that , we would have never seen any human potential available .
so many people are now in the world that spend at least an hour playing online .
these are our masterers . 500 million people who are extraordinary in &quot; something . &quot;
and in the next decade , we have another billion players who are extraordinary in whatever they are .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
the game industry developed consoles that save energy and work on mobile nets , instead of the broadband internet so that players can play online in india , especially in india , brazil .
you expect one extra billion players in the next decade .
so we &apos;ve got 1.5 billion players .
so i started thinking about what it &apos;s like to master those games .
here are the 4 things that i found . first of all , differential optimism .
ok , imagine how extreme self-motivated self-motivated .
labming optimism is the desire to do , immediately to master , to master , with the faith that we have a hope on success .
players always believe that a epic victory is possible , and it &apos;s always worth trying to do it , and it &apos;s the same .
players don &apos;t sit around .
players are denser in spiders .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting research that we &apos;re showing people more than we &apos;ve been playing with them , even if they &apos;ve been violated .
the reason is that it requires a lot of trust to play with someone .
we trust that somebody else is going to spend time with us that we have the rules , that we have the same goal , and we &apos;ll end up with the game .
so that allows you to grow up with binary , trust and with each other .
as a result , we build stronger social relationships .
happy productivity . fantastic !
you know , there &apos;s a reason why the average word of wardrum players play 22 hours a week , as a subtime job .
the reason is that if we play games , we &apos;re actually happier to work , as if we relax or do nothing .
we know that as human beings , we work as human beings , when we do hard work .
and players are always willing to work hard when they get the right task .
and ultimately , epic meaning .
players love it to be part of awe of awe of foreign missions .
here &apos;s a backpoint to go back to the right light . you know all wikipedia , the biggest wiki in the world .
the second wiki world , with almost 80,000 , is the world of warcraft .
five million people use it every month .
they put together more information about world of warcraft in the internet than any other subject of the world .
they create a epic story .
they create a epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , so these are four superpowers that lead to one outcome . players are super-powerful , hopeful individuals .
it &apos;s people who believe that they can change as single the world .
and the only problem is they believe they can change virtual worlds , but not the real .
this is the problem i try to solve .
edward caaddova is a medical scientist .
his work is great . he studied why people spend so much time , energy and money in online worlds .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re not going to be witnessing less than a mass dishistoric in virtual worlds and online parts . &quot;
and that &apos;s an economist . so it &apos;s logical .
and he says ...
not like me -- i &apos;m developing games , i &apos;m a little bit more lazy .
so he says that actually makes sense , because players can achieve more in online worlds than in real life .
you can do more powerful social commitment than in real life . you get more feedback and rewards in play than in real life .
so , he says , it &apos;s completely logical that players are getting more time in the virtual world than in the real .
i first agree , that &apos;s logical .
but it &apos;s definitely not an optical situation .
we need to start to turn the real world into a game .
my inspiration comes from one event , which is 2,500 years back .
there are these ancient cube , made of sheep . you know ?
in front of these fantastic video controllers there were sheds .
and these were the first of people developed toys .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the works of the old greek historian , you may know this story . the story about how and why games were invented .
according to the odotus , games have been invented , in the u.k. lydies , during a famine .
there was such a big famine that the king of lydies decided to get a crazy idea .
people suffered . people fought .
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
so they invented , according to herodotus , the box of the box , and put a national strategy on a national strategy , and the next day you would play .
and they would move so much into the box of the box , because games are so fascinating , and we &apos;ve been surrounded with satisfying , happy productivity , that they would forget nothing to eat .
and then the next day you would play . and the next day you would eat food .
and according to odotus , they lived this famine for 18 years by eating one day and the next .
so , i think we &apos;re putting games today .
we &apos;re putting games in order to escape the value of the real world .
we &apos;re putting games in order to get everything that doesn &apos;t work in the real world , all that is not really satisfying in real life , and we &apos;re bringing out what we need from play .
but it doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
that &apos;s exciting .
according to the desk , the famine didn &apos;t get better after 18 years , so the king decided to put a back of the box .
they shared the kingdom in two camps .
they were playing a box game , and they were allowed to break up a epic adventure .
they left lydies and they went to search for a new home , and they just went back so many people , like there were food to survive , and they were looking for the rest of an area where they could flourish .
that sounds crazy , right ?
but latest dna evidence shows that the etrus , which later came the roman empire , the same dna like the old lydians .
so scientists recently came to the perception that herodotus is actually true .
and geologists found evidence of a global impact that was almost 20 years , which could explain famine .
so this crazy story could be true .
maybe you &apos;ve actually saved your people through play by having 18 years in games , and then they &apos;ve learned so much about playing the whole civilization , that they &apos;ve saved the entire civilization .
so , we can also .
we &apos;ve been playing for 1994 .
this was the first strategy in real time in the world of warcrasion series , which was 16 years ago .
they were playing for 18 years , and we &apos;ve been doing warcraft for 16 years .
i say we &apos;re ready for our own epic game .
so , they sent half their civilization to a new world , so i take my 21 billion toys a week .
we should overend that half of us spend an hour with play every day , until we have the problems of the real world .
i know you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; how do we solve problems of the real world in games ? &quot; and that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;ve been doing in the last few years at the institute for the future .
we have this banner in palo alto , it puts out of how we should understand the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future before .
what we want is to create the future .
we want to think of the best result , and then people are empowered to make this idea in reality .
we put ourselves in epic wins and give people the possibilities to reach them .
i &apos;m going to show you a very short number of games that i designed to try to get people to try to get people into their own future .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
the game is by 2007 .
it &apos;s a online game where you have to overcome an oil spill .
the oil scarcity is invented , but we have enough online content , so it becomes realistic for them , and they actually live without oil . so , if you get to the game , you &apos;re asking , you know , videos , videos , videos , videos .
we tested this game with 1,700 players in 2007 , and we &apos;ve passed them over the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was a change experience .
nobody wants to change their lives because it &apos;s good for the environment or because we should .
but if you &apos;re in a epic adventure , and i &apos;ll say , &quot; we &apos;re going to go out of the oil . &quot;
this is a fascinating adventure , you know .
find out how they would survive . most of our players have that in the game .
so for the next world record , we have a bigger , higher goal than just oil scarcity .
we &apos;ve developed the game &quot; superstruct &quot; on the institute for the future .
in effect , the computation of a supercomputer is that people have only 23 years on the planet .
this supercomputer is called &quot; global countermortal system , &quot; of course .
the call for gamers to sign up , we &apos;ve done almost like a jerry brucker movie .
you know jerry bruckheimer-films , where there &apos;s the &quot; push team &quot; -- they have the astronauts , the scientists , the ex-laureates and just together they can save the world .
but in our game , instead of only five people , let &apos;s say , everyone is in the friam-team , and it &apos;s our job , the future for energy , food , health , security and the future of social justice .
8,000 players played the game for eight weeks .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that can read them when they google &quot; superstruct . &quot;
and the last game we put out on march three . it &apos;s a game in collaboration with the world bank .
if you finish the game , you get the award of the world bank , &quot; social reformers . &quot;
we work with universities in completely sub-saharan africa and shop to learn a social change .
we have a comic book . we have &quot; level high &quot; for local knowledge , knowledge of knowledge , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .
i want to invite you all to share this game with young people all over the world , especially in development areas that benefit from them , to save their own social .
i come to the end .
i want to ask you something .
what do you think happens next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t saved the real world yet .
well , i hope you agree with me that players are human resources that we can use to work in real life , and that games have a big meaning for change .
we have this whole superpowers , happy productivity , the ability to make close social networks , optimism optimism and desire for epic meaning .
i really hope that we play major games in order to survive on this planet .
and i hope you &apos;re going to design me with these games and play .
if i look at the next decade , i &apos;m sure about two things i &apos;m sure about : that we can create every single future , and we can play all kinds of games .
so i say , let &apos;s start the world changing games .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to tell you a little bit about what i &apos;ve seen a few months ago in the writing of role-magazine .
i &apos;ve always been willing to write my synonyan dictionary , but i &apos;ve been working with the texture of the textile , and i noticed that i &apos;ve never moved in my life , which means &quot; disabled &quot; really .
i read them the post .
&quot; disabled , &quot; adjective : retailing , helpless , useless , shattered , mugged , mugged , frogged , blinded , impotent , inpotent and weak .
antonyme : healthy , strong , powerful , powerful .
i read this list of a friend according to a friend , and i had to laugh , it felt so ridiculous , but i just came up until i got to read , and i didn &apos;t have to go to reading , and i had to pick up , and i had to pick up , and i had to start reading emotional shock .
of course , this was a very franstic old , old , old dictionary . i just thought that the copy has to be pretty old .
but in fact , it was a copy on the early &apos; 80s when i first started building my own image outside of my family , and i started to form my own image outside of my family , also in terms of other children and the rest of the world around me .
and thank god i didn &apos;t use synony-dictionary at the time .
if i would take this point seriously , i was born in a world that someone like me would perceive as a person whose life could be positive in a living way , but i &apos;m going to be celebrated for the opportunity and adventure that i &apos;ve experienced .
so i immediately launched the online performance of 2009 , and i expected me to share one of their contributions .
here &apos;s the current version of this picture .
it &apos;s not a lot better .
in particular , the last two words in &quot; near copenhagen &quot; is &quot; near &quot; and &quot; healthy . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just the words .
it &apos;s about what we think about the people we describe with these words .
it &apos;s about the values that are in these words , and how we construct these values .
our language affects our thinking and how we see the world and the people around us .
a lot of ancient societies , including the greeks and the roman , really believed that the language of a flight has a big force , because what you &apos;re talking about , too .
so , what do we actually want to manifest -- a disabled people or a powerful man ?
just to give you an eight-fold as a child , as a child alone , would be able to bend them and give them ideas .
wouldn &apos;t it be nice to open you up ?
a man who opened for me the doors was my pediatrician at the a.i. dupont institute in wilmington .
he &apos;s called dr. pizzutillo . an italo-american , whose name , like you can think , most americans couldn &apos;t speak correctly . so he was always called dr. p. .
and dr. p. was always going to fly very colorful and was just designed for the work with kids .
i found the time that i spent in this hospital just great -- until my physiological therapy .
i had to have a lot of effort in infinite times with these big , elastic bals -- in different colors -- you know , to build my leg muscles . and i hated these strands more than anything else . i hated it . i hated it . i hated it .
and imagine i even have a five-year child with dr. p. verlies and tried to stop this exercise , natural without success .
and one day , he was looking at me at one of my efforts -- this exercise was just tiring and grace -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re such a strong , powerful and young girl , you &apos;re going to cut one of those strands .
and if you act it , i give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
so , of course , this was just a simple trick of dr. p. , so i was making the work that i didn &apos;t want to do with the prospect of being the richest five girls in the hospital in the second floor , but he actually got me to see my daily affection with new eyes , and this was a new and promising experience .
and i &apos;m asking myself , how much his vision of me has shaped as strong and powerful young girls , and i could think of myself as one of the most powerful , powerful and breathing human beings .
this is just an example of many , many of how adults can aim the imagination of a child .
but as you &apos;ve already pointed out from the synonyan dictionaries books , it doesn &apos;t allow us to imagine our language , something that we would all want to do , what we all want to do , to see themselves as a powerful man .
our language is the social change behind the social change that was caused by a technological change .
of course , you can tell from the medical standpoint , of course , that my legs , the laser surgery for visually disabilities and artificial shells of titan , allow people to really use their ability to be able to get their natural identity out of the world .
so , maybe this kind of technological change is clear because there was always another truth , which is that every human being is able to do something special and give the human capacity to adapt , and that the human ability to adapt to our biggest plus is .
the human ability to adapt -- that &apos;s an interesting story , because people always ask me to tell , how do i deal with widrities and i &apos;m going to give you something : that sentence has never felt for me and i &apos;ve always felt very uncomfortable to answer people to answer , and i think , gradually , why .
this sentence from the relationship with widrities of the idea is that success or happiness depends on fighting a challenge , without being connected by the experience of being connected , because i could get the possible fall of a life .
but the truth is that we are changing . of course we are based on the challenge , whether whether or emotionally , or even both of them .
and i say that &apos;s good .
widrities are no obstacle that we need to expand to get better with our lives .
widrities are just to our lives .
and i tend to see widrities as my shadow .
sometimes i know that he &apos;s very present , sometimes he &apos;s barely seeing , but he &apos;s always in me .
and i just want to put the impact or the hard of the struggle of a human being .
there &apos;s a lot of stuff in life , and challenges , and they &apos;re just ubiquitous , and each person is going to be different , but the question is not whether we &apos;re going to get it right or not , but how we get it .
so we &apos;re not just responsible for the people we love to preserve , but they also prepare to get good at it .
and we don &apos;t like our kids when we give them the feeling that they can &apos;t adapt .
you have to clear two things : to be a medical fact , to be amputated and to the other , whether i &apos;m disabled or not .
and to be honest , the only thing that i had to make apart with , is that the world is constantly telling me that they could describe me with these definitions .
in our wish to protect people who are on the heart and tell them the cool , hard truth about their medical consent or even a projection for quality of life that they expect , we have to pay attention to the fact that somebody actually is disabled .
maybe this is a concept that is just looking at what &apos;s going on in a broken , and how we fix it , for every individual one larger disability .
if we don &apos;t treat a human being , and not all of its forces and possibilities and opportunities , we create in addition to the natural struggle that you may have to lead to a more disease .
we cut a people who have value for our society .
so we have to look beyond the patology and focus on all the area of human possibilities .
but the most important thing is that it &apos;s between perception of our ignorance and our great imaginative minds , a connection .
we shouldn &apos;t be able to deny these challenges , or we should not try to avoid them , we should not try and avoid them under the carpet , but it &apos;s about recognizing the opportunity .
it may be , perhaps , to make sure that we don &apos;t necessarily have to overcome that we &apos;re not necessarily going to have to get rid of it , but we &apos;re going to embrace them , to put them on the sboil to use a game , and maybe even dance with it .
and maybe we can do it , widrities as something natural , consistent and useful , and feel like that through your presence .
in this year , we celebrate 200 . of charles darwin and as he wrote about the evolution of 150 years ago , darwin , in my eyes , in a very real human character .
i would write it like this : not the most powerful of its kind survives , and not the most intelligent of its kind , but the one that can adapt to the best .
it comes from conflict .
not only know from darwin &apos;s work , we know the ability of people to survive and to flourish , from the fight of the human spirit , is to transform through conflict .
so , again , change and adaptation are the greatest skills of human beings .
and maybe we only know what that wood is when we really test it .
maybe that &apos;s the point of widrities , a sense of the iwar , a sense of our own power .
we can give ourselves something like that .
we can give a new meaning that goes beyond severe times .
maybe we can see the change as change .
widrities are for change we haven &apos;t yet adapted .
i think the biggest harm that we &apos;ve added ourselves to ourselves is to believe that we should be normal .
i mean , who &apos;s normal ?
there &apos;s no normal .
there &apos;s the usual . the typical . but not the normal . and they would really want to learn these poor , gray person , if they really would want it ?
i don &apos;t think so much .
it would be great if we think of this paradigm of normal , or the strength , to even make it a little bit more dangerous , replace the forces of very many children , and invite them to bring their special and valuable skills into society .
layma &apos;s found out that we have people from the members of our society always to be useful and to provide a contribution .
there are evidence that the neanderthals , since 60,000 years ago , have carried older people and people with severe physical injuries , and may , perhaps , because the life experience in survival of these people was valuable .
they don &apos;t have these people as broken and useless ; they were treated as something special and valuable .
a few years ago , i went to the city where i grew up in a food market in this red zone in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i was standing there in front of a brestiel tova .
it was summer , and i had margints .
and i hear how a guy behind me says , &quot; well , if you &apos;re not aimee mullins . &quot;
and i &apos;m running around and i see these older men . i had no idea who he is .
and i said , &quot; sorry , sir , we know ? i can &apos;t remember them . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , you may barely remember me .
when i first saw her , i took her from her mother &apos;s belly . &quot;
oh , so .
and of course , it made it click .
this was dr. kean , a man i only knew from narratives of my mother &apos;s day , because of course , i had two weeks late .
the doctor for prkins diagnosis of my mother was in vacation , and my parents knew the man who brought me to the world at all .
and because i was born without wadening legs , and my feet were looking for them , and i only had a few toes on the other foot , and i had a few toes on the other feet , and he had to bring the bad news .
he said to me , &quot; i had to tell your parents that you would never walk , and never would be as moving as other children or you could never have an independent life , and you just lie to me . &quot;
in fact , i found that he had collected newspaper clips of my entire childhood , whether i had gained with a letter competition in the second grade , whether i was going to hold up my scholarship , or i didn &apos;t care whether i had a grant or a sport of mine to teach his students , medical students , and hershey medical school .
and he called this part of his curator , the potential factor of the human being .
you can &apos;t emphasize enough how crucial this factor can be for human quality of life .
and dr. kean talked about it , he said , &quot; i &apos;ve learned that kids , if they don &apos;t have anything else , and even if they just get a bit of a support , they can achieve a lot of time . &quot;
see , dr. kean has changed his thinking .
he understood that the medical diagnosis , and how someone could deal with it , two different things .
and also , i had changed my thinking of time when she asked me about 15 years old , whether i had put my prosthesis on legs of flesh and bones , and i wouldn &apos;t have missed a second .
i really wanted normal work back then .
if you ask me that today , i &apos;m not so sure .
and that &apos;s because i &apos;ve experienced something with my legs , and not despite that experience .
and maybe this change could happen , because i &apos;ve come up with so many people who have been open to me , rather than people who are restricting me or gave me an idea .
you see , it really takes a people who show them how they can manifest their forces , and they &apos;re through .
if you allow someone to activate your own , inner power , the human spirit is so empirictous -- if you can do that , and for someone in a critical moment , you &apos;re a very good teacher , you &apos;re a very good teacher .
they teach them to open themselves themselves .
the real meaning of the word &quot; cala ce &quot; appeared in the word &quot; eduardo . &quot;
it means something creates something that is in a matter of tickle .
again , what potential do we want to call ?
in the &apos; 60s , in the u.k. , there was a case study in the u.k. that was turned on in total schools .
they call this &quot; track trials &quot; in the u.s. we call it &quot; tracking . &quot;
the students are thrown into grades .
and the one student will test coins harder , get the better teachers so far .
you &apos;ve got to have a three-month period of students with a &quot; enough &quot; the grade , and it was told you were a line that they were very clever . and after those three months , they really wrote .
and of course , it shattered to the heart that , of course , it was in the opposite of the students , they were just enough .
and it was the same for three months .
but only those who were still in school -- apart from the students who had failed school .
the key thing about this study was that the teachers weren &apos;t covered .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
they just said that they are the students and they are the students with the grade enough , and they &apos;ve taught them something , and they treat them .
the only real disability is a broken spirit , which has been broken , has no hope of hope , and it doesn &apos;t find any more beauty ; it doesn &apos;t get our natural , childhood discussion .
but if we can do it , the human spirit is going to continue to hope , to hope , and other people around themselves , to be beautiful and to be beautiful , and then we &apos;re going to put our forces really positive .
if a mind is about these qualities , we can create a new reality and new record .
i &apos;d like to end with a poem that was written by a persian pofiz called hafiz in 14th century , and my friend jacques bank told me , and the poem is called &quot; the god , the only four words . &quot;
come on , dance with me . thank you .
how would you want to be better than you currently are ?
suppose i said that through a few changes of their genes , a better memory could have -- more precise , more and faster and faster .
or you want to be more powerful , more force .
do you want more attractive and confident ?
how would it be to live longer with good health ?
or maybe they &apos;re one of those who always has more creativity .
which would you enjoy most ?
which would you like to have , if you could just have one ?
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see .
a few . probably as many as it is creative people here .
that &apos;s very good .
how many would choose for a good memory ?
a few more .
how about fitness ?
a few less .
what about longevity ?
ah , the majority . the lwatch i like to see as a doctor .
if you just have one of them , it would be a very different world .
is this all the education ?
or is it possible ?
evolution is an ongoing issue on the ted conference , but today i &apos;d like to give you the idea of a doctor &apos;s point of view .
the great genetic scientist in the 20th century , t.gs dobzhansky , who was also a communist in the russian orthodox church , wrote one sentence with the title &quot; nothing in biology doesn &apos;t make sense in the light of evolution . &quot;
now , if you &apos;re one of those who don &apos;t accept the proof of biological evolution , this would be a very good time to turn your listening , take your personal communication -- i &apos;ll give you permission -- and maybe you can take a look at kathryn school .
but if you accept biological evolution , you think about this : is it just about the past , or is it about the future ?
is it for others or is it to us ?
this is another view on the tree of life .
in this picture , i &apos;ve put a bush as a center of the pritter in all directions , because if you look at the side of the tree of life , all of the species of these branches have been successful in evolutionary terms : they have survived ; it has changed its environment .
the human part of this busty , far at the end , of course , is what we &apos;re most interested in .
we &apos;re two-and-a-half from a common ancestor to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago .
in this period , there may be 20 or 25 different species of hominids .
some are coming and left .
we &apos;ve been here for about 130,000 years .
it seems like we &apos;re right from the other parts of the building of life , but actually the biggest part , the fundamental mechanisms of our cells are quite equal .
is it clear that we can use it , and the mechanisms of a shared bacteria can be able to produce the protein of the human insulin , which is used to treat diabetics ?
this is not like humaninsulin ; this is the same protein that &apos;s chemically unregulated from what comes from the panse .
and what we &apos;re talking about is , you know , every one of us in our gut is given more bacteria than cells in the rest of our bodies ?
maybe 10 times .
i mean , do you think if antonio damasio asks her self-image about the bacteria ?
our gut is a wonderful hospitality environment for these bacteria .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s fire , it &apos;s very painful .
and you &apos;re all going to give you all the nutrients that you might just want to offer without effort .
it &apos;s really a lighter way of bacteria , with bacteria , forced by the unintended , jeodch to the outcome .
but otherwise , they &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria , just as they &apos;re important for their lives .
they help them with a vital nutrients , and they protect them against certain diseases .
but what will happen in the future ?
are we in a kind of evolutionary balance in form of a species ?
or are we supposed to be something else -- something that might even be more adapted to the environment ?
now let &apos;s take a step back into the big bang of the big bang , 14 trillion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years ago -- the first signs of creatures , maybe three to four billion years ago -- and then the human species , which in the last 130,000 years , eventually shapes .
in this vast uncomplete symphony of the universe , the life on earth is just very short ; the animal kingdom , like a single bar , and the human life , a small display .
we were .
this is also worth the entertainment of this talk , so i hope you &apos;d like to enjoy it .
now , when i was a nestuping on college , i had my first biology class .
i was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology .
i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i discovered something very fundamental : most of the existence of life in individual organisms , each cell , each cell , and all the genetic information of the cell will continue in both of these cell cells .
but at the time , when it appeared , things began to change .
sexual reproduction comes into the picture .
and very important , with the introduction of sexual reproduction , the genome continues to cost the rest of the body .
in fact , you could say that the inevitable of death in our body is going to happen in the same moment as the sexual reproduction .
now i &apos;ve got to stand , if i was a college student , i thought , okay , sex / death , sex / death , death for sex -- it seemed to be pretty reasonable at the time , but with every year , it has come to my increase .
i &apos;ve come to understand the feelings of george burns , which led his show in las vegas in the &apos; 90s .
and one night , there &apos;s a pat at his hotel airport .
he opens the door .
in front of him , this is a beautiful spumking .
she looks at him and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for super sex . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s wonderful , &quot; says george , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the soup . &quot;
i came to the realization that i was working on a destination that was different than the goal of evolution -- not necessarily conflicting , just different .
i tried to preserve the body .
i wanted to keep ourselves healthy .
i wanted to rebuild the health of a disease .
i wanted us to lead a long and healthy life .
evolution is all about the power of the genome to the next generation , adaptation and survival generation generation .
and from an evolutionary point of view , they are and i like booster rockets to send the genetic boxes to the next stage of the orbit to drop into the ocean .
i think we would all understand the mood , the woody of all the expression , when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to get unmortality through my work .
i want to do it by not being dead . &quot;
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily mean to prefer the longest life .
it doesn &apos;t necessarily get the biggest , the most powerful or the fastest , and not even the smartest .
evolution priys the creatures that adapt best to their environment .
it &apos;s only the test of survival and success .
on the bottom of the ocean , bacteria are there , which are thermophil , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going to survive , if fish would be there , if fish were there , they would have a vacuum .
so , what does that mean when we look back at what &apos;s happening in evolution , and how we think about the space of people in evolution , and especially as we look at the next phase , i would say there &apos;s a series of possibilities .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to move forward .
we &apos;ve reached a kind of balance .
and the reason for this would be that , first of all , through medicine , we managed to get a lot of genes that would be otherwise selected and made out of the population .
and secondly , as we have a spezy , our environment is so configuring us that we &apos;ve managed to adapt to ourselves , and we adapt to them .
and by the way , we go and round and mix so much that they can &apos;t say that isolation is necessary for the evolution to find .
a second way is that it &apos;s going to be an evolution of traditional way , of course , of course .
and the argument here is that the wheels of the evolution are slow down , but they &apos;re unseless .
and so far the isolation , when we colonize as a species distant planet , there will be isolated and changes of the environment that could produce evolution in natural ways .
but there &apos;s a third way , a compelling and scary possibility .
i call it neo-evolution -- the new development that isn &apos;t just of course , but led and decided of us as individuals that we do .
now , how could this happen ?
how could it be possible that we do this ?
let &apos;s look at the reality that people today are making decisions about their offspring .
they &apos;re , in some cultures , the choice to have more men than women .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family decide .
so think of if it &apos;s not just possible to choose the gender of your child , but also to use the body to heal the disease and prevent the disease .
what if you could make the genetic change in order to prevent diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s or reduce the cancer risk ?
wouldn &apos;t you want to do this change in your genes ?
if we look forward , these kinds of changes are increasingly possible .
the human genome project started in 1990 , and it took 13 years .
it cost 2.7 billion dollars .
next year , when it was done in 2004 , they could do the same for 20 million dollars in dra to four months .
today , you can get a sequence of three billion base pairs of human genome to a price of about $ 20,000 and in the space of about a week .
it &apos;s not going to take longer until the reality will be that there will be 1,000 dollars of human genome , and it will be increasingly available to everybody .
a week ago , the national academy of engineering is the draper prize for francis arnold and wilsty stemmer , two scientists , who developed the natural process of evolution , to work faster and to lead to a more efficient way -- which frances arnold .
a few years ago , the laser award of john shinya yamanaka was covered for his research in which he took an adult , a fibroblasts , and through the manipulation of just four genes that caused the cell to go back to a pluripotent cell cell .
these changes are happening .
the same technology that can make the human insulin in bacteria can do viruses that are not only protecting themselves , but also to be immune to other viruses .
whether or not they believe it or not , it &apos;s a experimental study in the gang with vaccine against influenza in the cells of a spreacplant plant .
can you imagine something good that comes from tobacco ?
this is all reality today and in the future will be much more possible .
so , imagine two other little changes .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells &apos; cells ?
what if you could change the sperm and the cells , or the fresh egg , to give your kids a better chance for a healthier life -- depending on the diabetes , the hemoppoor , the risk of cancer ?
who doesn &apos;t want to be healthier kids ?
and then the analytic technology , the same engine of science that can allow the change to prevent disease to prevent disease , could also allow us to adopt super-lot , hyper-capacity .
why did not have the capacity of one of the ken jennings , especially if you can extend it to the next generation of watni machine ?
why not have fast muscle fibers that will allow you to run faster and longer ?
why not live longer ?
these are going to be unconsistent .
and if we &apos;re in a place where we can pass it to the next generation , and we can be able to be the attributes that we want , we will be transformed by alt-style evolution .
we &apos;re going to have a process that requires probably 100,000 years , and we can add it to a thousand years and maybe even on the next 100 years .
these are decisions that their grandchildren , or their grandchildren , have to deal with .
do we use these decisions to form society that &apos;s better , the more friendly ?
or will we choose different attributes that we want for some of us and not for others ?
are we going to form a society , and we &apos;re going to dielate a society , or more robust and more robust ?
these are the kinds of questions we need to face .
and most of all , we will ever be able to develop the wisdom , and the wisdom , the wisdom we need to make these decisions ?
in the good way in the evil , and before you may think , these decisions are going to be on us .
thank you .
i want you to imagine now a little bit of a portable robot that gives you a human skill , or a different one that helps you to stand up and go again .
we call these robots exotic bionics .
they &apos;re not other than something that they put in the morning and gives them extra strength and increase their velocity and will help them keep their balance .
this is actually the true of human and machine .
but not only that -- that &apos;s how it works and interconnect with the universe and other devices .
it &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
now , to show you what we &apos;re working on , we start talking about the american soldiers who carry about 100 pounds on its back , and it &apos;s the question that they should carry more equipment .
of course , this leads to some major complications -- spinal injuries , 30 percent of it -- chronic spinal cord .
so we thought we would embrace this challenge and create an exotic skeleton that would help deal with this problem .
so let me now introduce you to hulc -- or universal correctness .
soldier : with the hulc exotic skeleton , i can carry 200 pounds across different terrain , many hours long .
his flexible design allows it to inhilow down deeply to the warrior , and to perform highly effective movements .
it feels that what i want to do is to go where i want to go and increase my strength .
we &apos;re at the same time with our industrial partner of this device , this new exotic skeleton in this year .
so it &apos;s true .
so let &apos;s take our view on the board record , something that i &apos;m particularly passionate about .
there are 68 million people estimated in the wheelchair in the wheelchair .
this is about one percent of the total population .
and that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate .
and we &apos;re often talking about very young people with spinal cord injuries that are in the drtetime of their lives -- 2020s , 30s , 47 -- from fate , and the wheelchair is the only option .
but it &apos;s also about aging population , their number of copies .
and so , pretty much the only option -- if it comes to a brain beat , or is it a wheelchair .
and so , by the way , it &apos;s been 500 years since that , as i have to say , very successful introduction .
so we thought we could start writing a completely new chapter in mobility .
so let me now introduce you to elegance that &apos;s carried by amanda boxtel , who had a spinal cord injury in 19 years ago , which is that they couldn &apos;t walk anymore for 19 years and so far .
thank you .
as i said , amanda carries our elegance .
it has sensors .
his completely non-invasive sensors in the hertses that send signals back to our onboard computer , which is attached to their back .
here are also battery-pack pieces , the motor motor is on its hip , as well as your klow joints that you move forward in this pretty smooth and very natural mood .
i was 24 years old , and i was in best form , as a monger of pure pure tree during a ski ride .
in a second of a second , i lost every feeling and every movement underneath my car .
not long after that , a doctor in my hospital and he said , &quot; amanda , you can never go again . &quot;
and that was 19 years ago .
he gets steel every five hundred .
adapttechnologies have made it possible for me to learn again , to climb , to climb and to drive with the hands .
but nothing was invented to me again , until now .
thank you .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to meet and discuss with them .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we have the whole potential here to change the life of future generations -- not just for the soldiers , or for amanda here and all the wheelers , but for all .
thank you .
at home in new york , i &apos;m the ceo of the developing department of a non-profit organization called robin hood .
if i don &apos;t fought poverty , i fought as the aid of a fireman in a volunteer , the fire .
now , in our city , in the volunteers , a highly skilled job department , you have to be very early on the brand , to be able to mix .
i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunteer at the high school , so i had a pretty good opportunity to get in .
but it was still a poor stop against the other volunteers , and to find out what our jobs would be .
when i found the main man , he just had a very serious conversation with the janitships that certainly had one of the worst days of her life .
it was in the middle of the night , and she was in the wake train and barfoot under a screen outside in the hallway , while her house was in flames .
the other volunteers who arrived in front of me was -- let &apos;s call him lex luther -- the main man as first and was asked to go to the house and save the dog &apos;s dog .
the dog ! i was lying in trouble .
there was a lawyer or wealth , which was now for the rest of his life , telling people that he was in a burning of the house to save a living creature just because he was five seconds faster than i did .
well , i was the next .
the main man came to me .
he said , &quot; review , you have to go into the house .
you have to go up , the fire over , and you have to get a pair of shoes . &quot;
i swear .
now , not exactly what i &apos;d hope to do , but i went to -- the trebs high , the flur , on the &quot; the real &quot; firemen who were running at this point at that point , in the bedroom around a few feet .
i know what you &apos;re thinking , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i was wearing my prey back to the door where i met my house and met my beloved dog .
we put our minds out to the house , where , not surprisingly , he got more attention than my .
a couple of weeks later , the firepark got a letter of the house of the house , which she was going to take for the tathouse in the rescue of her house .
and one of the things that led kindness : somebody had a few shoes .
in my profession , in robin hood , and in my next profession as a volunteer fireman , i &apos;m a witness of generosity and kindness in the great scale , but i also see the practice and the muts of individual .
and you know what i learned ?
they &apos;re all important .
so when i see myself in this room , and i see people who are either succeeding , or they &apos;re in their way , i want to offer the following memory : wait for you .
don &apos;t wait to make a difference in a different life , until they reach their first million .
if you have something to do , you give it .
use in a food kitchen , rooms in a neighborhood in the neighborhood .
be a mentor .
not every day , we will offer a chance to save a human life , but every day , the ability to change one .
so they put it on ; save the shoes .
thank you .
bruno guissani : mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
i just come back from a community that knows the secret of mankind .
a place where the women lead the zepter , with sex &apos; hello , and the game is determined -- where fun is serious .
and no , it &apos;s not a categman or san francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , their relatives .
this is the world of wild bonobos in the ancient forest of congo .
bonobos are together with chimpanzees , our next living relatives .
that means we have a common ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother who lived about six million years ago .
now , chimpanzees are known for their interest .
but unfortunately , we &apos;ve overstated this aspect of the human evolution .
but bonobos show us the other side of the memes .
and as chimpanzees of great , fear has led , the feminine society of empowerment has led women to women .
they &apos;ve really come up with what comes up , because that leads to a very extreme society that has not been seen in the deadly violence .
but unfortunately , bonobos are least known under primates .
they live in the deep part of the gulf whale , and they &apos;re just very hard observation .
congo is a paradox -- a country of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of the darkness itself -- the one-place of a violent argument that has been around for decades , and it has so many lives like the first world war .
it &apos;s not surprising that this destruction also is the survival of the bonobos .
meat and the decline of the tree will lead that you could not even fill a stadium with the bonobos -- and even there are not sure to be honest .
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a hidden joke that the trees beat .
who are these related related ?
we know them as &quot; love of war &quot; monkeys , because they have common , even bisexual sex , with partners , and rules and social angelments .
i &apos;m not saying that that &apos;s the answer to all the humanitarian problems -- because the bonobos of the bonobos are made out of more than the chamtra .
bonobos -- like humans -- love to play their lives long .
play doesn &apos;t just mean children &apos;s games .
for us , and it &apos;s fundamental to the attachment of relationships and care of tolerance .
we &apos;re learning to trust and the rules of the game .
play increases creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s all about the generation of diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity of behaviors , diversity of relationships .
and if you look at bonobos in the game , you see the evolutionary origins human being , dance and rituals .
play is the tickt that holds us together .
now , i don &apos;t know how they play , but i want to show you some unique footage straight from the wild .
first of all , a ball-game on feminine art -- and i don &apos;t think about football .
so here we see a young female and males in a chase game .
look at what she does .
this could be the evolutionary origin of : &quot; you put it on the eggs . &quot;
just that i think it &apos;s more like it , not true .
yeah !
so sex games are common , both with bonobos and people .
and this video is really interesting , because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows the ideality that you can get into the game -- like the testicers -- and also , as the game is doing it , as it does .
but the game is an formler .
play is an formler and it can take a lot of shapes from which some of which are quiet , leads to , say , to discover the wondrous again .
and i want to show you , this is fuku , a young female , and she plays peace with water .
i think it &apos;s just as you play , sometimes , and we pollinate boundaries of our inner and external worlds .
and it &apos;s this playful curiosity that makes us work , and we interact , and the unexpected connection that we form are the real foods of creativity .
this is just a little taste of insights that the bonobos give us in our past and present .
but they also have a secret for our future , a future in which we have to adapt to serious challenges , through larger creativity and prints .
the secret is that the game &apos;s game is key to these skills .
in other words , play is our adaptive .
in order to adapt to an unconsistent world , we have to play .
but will we make the best part of our game drive ?
play is not silly .
it &apos;s essential .
for bonobos and people equally , life isn &apos;t from teeth and claws alone .
now , if it &apos;s hardly appropriate , it may be the most likely thing to do .
and therefore , my primatenmates , let &apos;s embrace this gift of evolution and play together , while we rediscover creativity and wonder .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two pairs , in the middle 1979 , at the same time , in exactly the same moment , each one of the baby -- all right .
so two pairs , each one a baby .
now i don &apos;t want you to use too much time to imagine , because if you imagine the whole time , you won &apos;t listen to me .
imagine that just for a moment .
and in this scenario , you can imagine that in a case the sperm is wearing a y chet that hits the x chromosome on the x chromosome .
and in the other case , the sperm is wearing a x chromosome on the x chromosome .
both of them are survival , both light .
we &apos;ll get back to these people later .
in most of my activities , i have two hatches .
under a hat , i &apos;m dealing with the history of anatomy .
i was an historian , a reporter , and in this case , i study how people went around anatomy -- meaning human body , animal body -- as they were thinking about body fluids , with body content .
the other hat that i wore in my work is the activist , as a patient &apos;s lawyer -- or , as i say sometimes , as an impatient lawyer -- from people who are patients .
in this case , i &apos;ve worked with people who have social norms in question .
so , for example , i worked with people who are siamese twins , two people in a body .
i &apos;ve been working with zwarf , so people who were smaller than common .
and very often , i &apos;ve worked with intersexual people whose gender is atypic -- so people who don &apos;t have the average male or female body types .
and as general , we can use the word intersexual .
intersexuality comes in many different forms .
i &apos;ll just give you a few examples of the kinds of guys of sexual variation that are not in the male or female standard .
in a case , you may have someone with a loyous basis , and the sry gene of the y chomosoms leaves the post , which we have all of the time to grow up .
and that &apos;s why the testicles are giving testosterone to testosterone .
but because this individual is missing the receptors to detect testosterone , the body doesn &apos;t respond to testosterone .
and this is called androgenreceptor bug .
so much testosterone , but no reaction to it .
as a result , the body evolves more to the typical female course .
if the kid is born , she looks like a girl .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s raised as a girl .
but it takes most of the time to get puberty and grow their breasts and develop them , but they don &apos;t get their period until someone comes to it .
and they do a couple of tests and find out that instead of iron and utero , it &apos;s actually teaming in and that they have a y chromosome .
it &apos;s important to understand that you could actually hold this person for male , but they &apos;re not really .
women , like men , have something called adrenaline silk .
they are in the back of our bodies .
and the side kidders make androgenic , which is virilisizing hormones .
most women , like me -- i think a typical woman -- i don &apos;t know about being my real chromosome , but i think i probably don &apos;t have the typical -- most women like me are actually talking to android .
we produce androgenic and we talk to androgenic .
the consequence is that someone like me actually has a brain that was exposed to more androgenic than a woman who was born with testicles and a androgenreceptor bug .
so gender is really complicated ; things aren &apos;t just in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in some sense , you can be distributed across the whole range of bandwidth .
another example , a couple of years ago , i received the call of a 19 year-old man who was born as young as a boy , he had a friend , had sex with his girlfriend , lived with his girlfriend , and he had just figured out that he had vanessed and a utero .
he had an extreme form of an innate bykidney cattle .
he has xx chromosome , and in the womb , his side kidders were so highly active that they basically created a male hormone environment .
and as a result , his gene was ingested to male , his brain was exposed to the crossmale part of the hormone spectrum .
and when he was born , he looked like a boy -- no one imagined anything .
and only as he was 19 years old , he got enough medical problems , in fact , because he did it inside , that the doctors found that he was inside his female .
okay , just a quick example of an intersexual form .
some people with xx chromosomes are creating something that is called the octal tissue , which is exploited by hodenan tissue .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this happens .
so gender can occur in many different varieties .
the reason why children with this kind of body -- whether it &apos;s been zwarf or siamesic twins , it &apos;s intellectual -- it &apos;s often adapted to the norm , is not because of surgeons .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
the reason why you &apos;re doing surgery often is because you &apos;re threatened by our social categories .
most of our system is based on the idea that a certain anatomic auinterview is about a certain identity .
so we have the concept that a woman &apos;s identity is a female identity ; a black person is meant to have an african anatomy in terms of their own history .
so we have this awful idea .
and if we faced with a body that is actually something very different for us , it confused us in terms of this monument .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas in our culture of individualism .
and our nation is really based on a very romantic concept of individualism .
now you can imagine how amazing it is when kids are born , which are two people in a body .
where i saw most of the time in the last time , the south american transplant was in caster seieya last year , whose gender was asked to be asked in berlin .
many journalists call me the question : &quot; what test are you going to do , who tells us whether caster is female or male ? &quot;
and i had to explain the journalists that it didn &apos;t exist .
we now know that gender is complicated enough that we have to admit that nature is not going to take us a line of male and female , or between male and intersexually and female , and the female , of course , we are , of course , that line that line .
so we have this kind of situation where , the further our science continued , we have to look around more and more , that these categories that we had thought of as robust anatomic categories to create permanent identical settings to create permanent identical ideas than we imagined .
and that &apos;s not just about gender .
it &apos;s also true of race , which is a lot more complicated than our terminology allowed .
in our words , we get into all sorts of unplacents .
for example , we &apos;re looking at the fact that we have at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees .
what are we supposed to do with the fact that we only differ from a few of them ?
as we move our science forward , we &apos;re increasingly moving into a zone of unfold where we need to recognize that the simplical categories we &apos;ve probably had are very simple .
we see this in all sorts of places of human life .
one of the areas that we see that we &apos;re looking at , in our culture today , in the united states today , are the struggle and the end of life .
we have difficult conversations about what a body is going to be like to humans , so that it has a different right than the adult life .
we have a very difficult thing to do today -- perhaps not as public as in medicine -- about the question , when someone is dead .
our ancestors never had the question to fight when someone was dead .
you &apos;ve got somebody who &apos;s held your nose under the nose , and if you moved , you don &apos;t have it buried .
if you didn &apos;t move anymore , you &apos;ve buried it .
but today we &apos;re in a situation where we &apos;re taking people &apos;s lives , and they want to reproduce other people .
and as a result , we &apos;re going to start with the really hard question when someone is dead , and that brings us into a really difficult situation where we don &apos;t have that simple categories as we used to .
now , you might think that the whole thing was going to break together from categories of somebody like me .
i &apos;m politically progressive , i defense people with unusual bodies , but i have to admit it makes me nervous .
now , to understand that these categories are really much more insecure than we thought it was .
and it makes me hooked in terms of thinking about democracy .
so to tell you about this tension , i have to first know that i &apos;m a big fan of the green fathers .
i know they were working , i know they were fine , but they were great .
i think they were like the copper and very strong , and so radical , in which they were doing all the years , i &apos;m going to take a look at the toys of 1776 , and it &apos;s not because of the music that &apos;s absolutely forgotten .
it &apos;s because of what happened 1776 with the green fathers .
the green fathers were from my view of the original anatomic activists , which is why .
and what she was suggesting was an anatomic concept , and they were putting it through another , which was radical and beautiful , and 200 years for us .
as you all remember , our greening fathers did the concept of monarchy , and the monarchy based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy .
the glory of the old world had no concept based on dna , but they had a concept of birth on the right .
they had a concept of blue blood .
they were the notion that people who had political power would have to have this political power , because of the prosecuts of the grandfather to the father and so on .
the green fathers suggested this idea , and they put them through a new anatomic concept , and this concept said that all people have become equal .
they were playing the game , and they decided that anatomically , the commonings , the common , not the differences , and that was very radical .
now they made this part because they were part of an education system in which two things grew together .
democracy grew up , but at the same time , science grew .
if you look at the story of the green fathers , it becomes clear that many of you were very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of nature .
and they went away from explanations to natural species , and they sort of suggested things like a supernatural concept of power , back where the transmission on a very , very high concepts of birth .
they moved to a nature concept .
and if you look at the independence of independence , you talk about nature and the god of nature .
they &apos;re not talking about god and nature .
they talk about nature &apos;s power to tell us who we are .
and as part of this , they created a concept of anatomical similarities .
and they really prepared the future civil rights movement .
they didn &apos;t think about it , but what they did for us was great .
so what happened next ?
for example , women used to use the election properly , the concept of the green fathers , which says that anatomic is more important than the anatomic difference , and they said , &quot; that we should have an inference and an egg , etc . , etc . , etc . &quot;
and women argued the successful .
next was the successful civil rights movement , where we saw people like sostafner leganer , who said , &quot; am i not a woman ? &quot;
we find men in the class line of the burden of justice , saying , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , human skin color , which is on anatomical similarities differences , again , successful .
we see the same thing on the disabled legal movement .
of course , the problem is that , as we begin to look at all the similarities , we have to start asking in question , why do we sustain specific ?
well , well-consciously , i want to keep sharing certain ties , anatomically , in our culture .
for example , i don &apos;t want to give the same rights to a fish like a human .
i don &apos;t want to say that we should take away from the anatomy .
i don &apos;t want to say that 5-year-old is supposed to have the right to get your understanding of sex or getting married .
so there are some anatomical contacts that make sense for me , and we think i should keep .
but the challenge is to try to figure out what it is and why we keep them and whether they &apos;re sense .
so let &apos;s come back to those two creatures that have been put into the beginning of the talk .
we have two creatures in the middle 1979 , both the same day .
let &apos;s imagine that one of them was born , maria , three months old , so she was born on june 1 .
heinrich , on the other side , is born to the center of march , so he was born on march 1 .
just because maria was born three months old , she takes all kinds of rights three months ago -- the right to have sex , the right to choose , the right to drink .
heinrich needs to wait for all this , not because he actually has a different biological age , just because of the time of the time of his birth .
we find other weird skills about what their rights is .
heinrich , because you &apos;re assuming that he &apos;s a male -- although i didn &apos;t tell you that he &apos;s at the mit -- because you suspect he &apos;s a male , he can now be moved , what maria doesn &apos;t need to worry about .
maria and maria can &apos;t perceive the same right to all states , the heinrich in all states , and that &apos;s the right to marry .
heinrich can marry a woman in every state , but maria can only marry a woman in a few states today .
so we have these permanent accelerated categories that are in many ways that are problematic and fragmented .
and for me , the question is : what are we going to do , because our science is doing such progress in the anatomy of anatomy that we &apos;re going to have to get a point where a democracy is based on anatomy that could fall down to anatomy ?
i don &apos;t want to give up science , but at the same time , sometimes it feels like the science is self-changing .
so where do we go ?
it seems like our culture is going to take a kind of pragmatic posture : &quot; well , we have to pull a line somewhere , so we pull them somewhere . &quot;
but a lot of people start in a very strange position .
so for example , texas , in a point , decided to marry a man , that you didn &apos;t have y chromosome , and a woman to marry that you had a y chromosome .
now , in practice , people are not tested on their chromosome .
but it &apos;s also very bizarre because of the history that i told you about the android receptor bug .
if we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us in his &quot; i have a dream . &quot;
he says we shouldn &apos;t be people in &quot; skin skin , &quot; but after the property of their character , &quot; judge , &quot; and it goes beyond anatomy .
and i want to say , &quot; yes , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
but how do you do that in practice ?
how do you express people from their character properties ?
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we &apos;re going to be able to do right in terms of people , because i need to admit that i &apos;ve ever had a series of golden heights that are likely to make most of the most important people i know .
i want to predict that i probably know some of the light labs that are more capable of funditional , intelligent and over-profit decisions on their sexual relationships than some of whom i know .
so how shall we make the question of the character of the character ?
it turns out to be really hard .
and a part of me wonder , what if the content of a personality would be something that could be done in the future in the future ?
do we really want to go into this direction ?
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
what i know is that it really seems to be important to think about the idea that the united states is leading to make thoughts about the questions of democracy .
in our effort , we &apos;ve done democracy really well , and i think we would make our thing good in the future .
we don &apos;t have the situation , for example , in iran &apos;s case , where a man who &apos;s attracted sexually to other men is going to be suffering to the death of death , because he &apos;s ready to underforce an ethnic environment in which he can stay alive .
the states of this kind exist with us .
i &apos;m glad to be able to say that we don &apos;t have these conditions -- a surgeon i talked about a few years ago , which had a few siamesian twins with each other to separate them , partly to make a name .
but when i was with him , and he asked him why he made these trade-offs -- it was up to the top surgeries -- his answer was that in his country , these children would be treated very badly , and so he had to do it .
i said to him , &quot; well , have you taken political asyles to consider it , rather than separate a surgery ? &quot;
the united states spends incredible opportunities to allow people to be able to change without the rest of the state .
so i think we need to be leaders .
well , just to conclude , i want to see that i talked very much about the fathers .
and i want to think about the possibilities of how democracy could look , or looked at if we had more involved .
and i want to say something that &apos;s radical for a feminist thing , and i think that there might be different kinds of insight that led by different types of anatomy , especially when people apply a group thinking .
since years , because i was interested in intersexuality , i was also interested in research in gender .
and one of the things i really found interesting is the difference between men and women in terms of how they think and operate in the world .
what we &apos;ve learned from cultural surplus studies is that women , in average -- not every one , but in average -- tend to tend to have complex social relationships and care for people who are in the group of vulnerable .
and so , if we think about it , we have an interesting situation .
years ago , when i was making a graduate student , one of my graduate students who knew my interest in feminism -- i looked at myself as a feminist , so doing it -- a really strange question .
he said , &quot; tell me what the feminism is female . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , this is the most stupid question i &apos;ve ever heard .
feminism is about solving stereotypes about gender , which is why feminism is nothing female .
but the more i thought about his question , so i thought that there could be something female in feminism .
this is to say , there could be something , in average , which is female brains of male males , which makes us attention to highly complex social relationships , and make sure more carefully for the protective .
so where the green fathers were extremely considerable to find out how individuals could be protected before the state , it &apos;s possible that if we put more mothers in this concept , we have more idea of a concept , not just how to protect them .
and maybe it &apos;s where we need to go to the future when we take democracy over anatomy -- less than to think about the individual bodies of what identity is about , and more about relationships .
so , when we try to make a more perfect connection , we think about what we can do for each other .
thank you .
i &apos;m jessi and this is my suitcase .
but before i show you what i have in it , i &apos;m going to make a very public confession , and this is : i &apos;m obsessed with outfits .
i love to find a different kind of colorful , madky outfit , to be able to find and blogging in recent times .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
i get all my clothes from the second hand , and in a single-hand catalog .
thank you . thank you .
it allows me shopping hand to reduce the impact of my garoobe on the environment and also reduce my money services .
i meet all kinds of great people ; my dollars usually serve a good purpose ; i look pretty unique ; and it &apos;s shopping to my personal search .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
will it have my size ?
am i going to like color ?
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
if all the answers , i feel like i won .
i come back to my suitcase , and i &apos;ll tell you what i came up with here for this exciting week at ted .
i mean , what does someone bring with so many outfits ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i &apos;ve brought .
i brought up seven couple of pants , and this is all .
so for a week , it &apos;s all i &apos;ve done in my suitcase .
i &apos;ve led that i &apos;ve got everything else that i would like to wear when i came to palm springs .
and because she &apos;s not heard of me as the woman who &apos;s running around at ted in her underwear -- called this , i found a couple of things .
and i really want to show you my outfits for this week .
does that sound good ?
while i do that , i &apos;m also going to give you some of the lessons that i , whether you believe it or not , from this adventure , has learned nothing new .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
i call this the beam tiger .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look great .
you can almost look great for less than 50 dollars .
this whole outfit , including the jacket cost me 55 , and it was the most expensive piece that i carried in this whole week .
monday : color is something powerful .
it &apos;s almost impossible to be bad , if you &apos;re wearing light red pants .
if you &apos;re happy , you draw other happy people .
tuesday : adapt all the time .
i spent a lot of my life trying to be trying to be myself , and at the same time .
just be who you are .
if you &apos;re surrounded by the right people , you won &apos;t just understand it , you &apos;ll appreciate it .
wednesday : embrace your inner child
sometimes people say , i looked at people , i saw the games , or i remember her seven-year-olds .
i &apos;d like to smile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
thurday : confidence is the key .
if you think you &apos;re looking at something good , it &apos;s almost safe .
and if you think it doesn &apos;t look good , you probably have right .
i grew up with a mother who taught me a day for day .
but only when i became 30 , i really understood what that means .
and i &apos;m going to wrap this up for you .
if you think they &apos;re inside and outside a wonderful person , there &apos;s nothing you can &apos;t wear .
so there &apos;s no excuse for somebody here in this audience .
we should be able to rocking everything we want .
thank you .
friday : a universal truth -- five words : golden pailleites fit to everything .
and finally , saturday : one , unique , personal style , is a great way to tell the world about one word without having to say a word .
it was always proven to me and always proved when people came to me this week , just because of what i was wearing , and i had great conversations .
obviously that &apos;s not going to fit all in my tiny suitcase .
so before i go home to brooklyn , i &apos;m going to donate it all back .
because the lesson that i &apos;m trying to learn this week is that it &apos;s okay to leave .
i don &apos;t have to make these things emotional , because at the same time , it will always be a different kind of crazy , colorful , intense outfit , which is just waiting for me when i love a bit of love , and it &apos;s looking for it .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good afternoon , all together .
i have something that i want to show you .
think of this as an image , flying image .
this is what we call the perceptual design in our lab .
let me tell you a little bit about it .
now if you take this picture -- i &apos;m italian , and every boy in italy grows with this picture in his room , but the reason why i &apos;m showing you this is a very interesting one in the last decades .
a couple of time ago , if you wanted to win a formula , they took their budget and they put their money on a good driver and a good car .
and if the car and the driver was good enough , they won the race .
now , today , if you want to win a race , it actually takes something like this -- something that &apos;s the car in real time , some thousand sensors that have information out of the car , and then change the information on the system , and then change things in real time as information is collected in time .
this would call them , in engineering teams , a real-time control system .
and basically , it &apos;s a system that &apos;s made out of two parts -- a sense of a sense and an argument .
what &apos;s interesting today is real-time control systems in our lives .
our cities became , in the last few years , with networks and electronics .
they become computer in the free .
and as a computer in the free , they start reacting to other kinds of ways , they &apos;re being driven and driven .
if we go to cities , that &apos;s actually a big deal .
by the way , i want to mention that cities are only two percent of the earth &apos;s land , but 50 percent of the world &apos;s population lives there .
they &apos;re 75 percent of the energy consumption -- to 80 percent of co2 emissions .
so if we do something with the cities , it &apos;s a big thing .
beyond the cities , all of this sense , and drive into objects of everyday life .
this is from a show , the paola antonelli for moma later in the year of summer .
it &apos;s called &quot; smoke . &quot;
well , all of our objects , our environment , start to talk to us .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost like every atom out there will be out there , a sensor and a frog .
and this is radically changing interaction that we have with our environment .
in a way , it &apos;s almost like the old dream of michelangelo ...
you know , as a michelangelo shaped the moses , it says he took the hammer , and he threw it on moses -- in fact , you can still see a little bit of a spot -- and said , &quot; perop shorter parli ? why don &apos;t you ? &quot;
now , today , our environment begins to respond to us .
i &apos;m just going to show you a few examples -- again , with the idea of taking our environment into the environment .
let &apos;s start with that .
now the first project i want to introduce you to is really one of the first of our labs .
it emerged four and a half years ago in italy .
and what we &apos;ve done was actually to use new kinds of network that was used throughout the world -- that &apos;s a mobile phone net -- and anonymously and gathering information from this network that will be collected from the operators to understand how the city works .
the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
it was as the pedestria world championship .
some of you will remember , it was as italy against france , and then at the end , the headhead .
and no matter in italy .
now you &apos;re looking at what happened in this day , just watching the activity that happens in the network .
here you see the city .
you see , in the middle , the giant seum , the flight .
the morning , before the game .
you see the timeline up there .
earlier afternoon , people here and there , the phone calls and moving .
the game begins -- silence .
france makes an tor . italy makes an tor .
at the time , people do a short call , go on toilet .
second half . end of normal play .
first longevity , second .
quote , in a moment of head .
italy wins . yeah .
well , in this night , everybody went to the center to celebrate .
they saw the big bang .
the next day , all of us went to the center of the seal and the prime minister at the same time .
and then everybody went down .
you can see the picture of the scene of circo massimo , where , since the roman time , the people go to celebrate -- to have a big party , and you see the impact on the end of the day .
now , this is just an example of how we can feel the city today , in a way that we couldn &apos;t do it a few years ago .
so quickly , another example of feeling : this is not about people , but it &apos;s not about people that we use and consume .
now , we know all about where our things come from .
this is a map that shows you all the chips from which a mac computer has come together .
but we only know little about where things go .
so in this project , we actually designed some little markers to track the garbage while it comes through the system .
so we started with some volunteers that are taught us something more than a year ago , in seattle helped to mark things that they were able to throw away -- different kinds of things , like you can see -- things that you would throw out .
and then we have the little chips that put little brands on the trash and start tracking it .
here are the results that we &apos;ve just got .
by seattle ...
after a week .
with this information , we realized there &apos;s a lot of inefficiency in the system .
we can make the same things with less energy .
the data was not available before .
but that &apos;s a lot of unuseful plants , and more complicated things .
but the other thing is , we believe that if we see every day , the cup that we throw , we don &apos;t just go away , that it &apos;s still somewhere on the planet .
and the plastic bottle that we still throw every day there .
and if we would show the people , then we can move a change change .
so that &apos;s the reason for this project .
my colleague at mit , assaf biderman , could tell you a lot more about the experience and the many other wonderful things that you can make with sense , but i &apos;d like to talk to the second part that we talked about at the beginning , and that &apos;s our environment .
and the first project is something we did a few years ago in tenagoza , spain .
it started with a question of the civil citizenship , which came to us and said that spain and south india have a beautiful tradition , in public places as part of architecture .
and the question was , how could you do technology , new technology ?
and one of the ideas that have been trained in a workforce was , imagine this sort of mammal , and valves , magnetic valves , functions that open and close .
they &apos;re going to cause a water set of water points from water .
if this plot falls down , you can write patterns , you can write patterns , images , text .
and you can approach him , and he &apos;s going to open up to leave you through , like you can see on this picture .
well , we introduced the mayor of belhole .
it really loved him .
and we got the mission to design a building in the expo .
we called it the digital water pavillion .
the whole building was water .
there &apos;s no doors or windows , but if you &apos;re approaching it , it will open up and leave it .
the roof was also covered with water .
and if you &apos;re going to reduce the syringe , you can even drop the roof down .
or you could close the building and the whole architecture , like in this case , you know , this day when you go down the roof , you get pictures of people who were there and say , &quot; you &apos;ve destroyed the building . &quot;
no , they didn &apos;t destroy the building ; it &apos;s just that architecture almost disappears .
here &apos;s how the building works .
you see the person who says what happens inside .
and here you see me when i tried to test the sensors of the sensors that opened the water .
now , i should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors were to work .
but actually , it was a greater great fun night .
all the children from tenagoza came to the building , because the way they were playing with the building was very different .
no longer a building that would open open to you , but a building that still had pause and holes in the water , you had to jump without getting wet .
and that was , for us , very exciting , because as architects , engineers , as designers , we think about how people are using things that we design .
but reality is always unexpected .
and that &apos;s the beauty of creating things that are used and interact with people .
now here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical imaging points , the image points from water and the projections .
and this is what brought us to think about the following project that i &apos;m going to show you now .
imagine that this image could really start flying .
imagine you could have little helicopters that fly through the air , and every one of you with a small picture of an interaction with the light -- almost like a cloud that can move through the space .
here &apos;s the video .
imagine a helicopter that you saw before , which moves to others , completely in synchrony .
you can have these cloud .
you can have a kind of flexible screen or an ad , like this -- an equal formation in two dimensions .
or unregular , in three dimensions , where what changes , what &apos;s changing is not the position of imaging points .
you can play with different types .
imagine the screen could just appear in different formats or sizes , in different ways .
but then it could be just a 3d cloud from image points that you can go to , and through that you can move through , which you can look at from many , many directions .
so here you can see a real flyfire-controlling control that goes down to form an equal v .
if you turn the lights out , it looks like this . so , just like we saw before .
imagine every single one of the people being controlled .
it could have a impulse every single point that comes from people , from the movements of people or whatever .
i want to show you something here first .
we worked with robert to bolle , one of the best ballet dancers of our time -- the étole at the metropolitan theater in new york , and the scala in maan -- we took his movement in 3d to use it as an impulse for the flyfire .
here you see robert to dance .
on the left side , you see the image of the picture , the different ones .
it &apos;s a real-time 3d scan , and a movement shot .
so they can understand all the movement .
you can do that all the time .
but then , if we have all the points , you can play with it and gravity and play motion .
we want to use that as a possible impulse for the flyfire .
i want to show you the latest project that we &apos;re working on .
it &apos;s something we work on for the olympics in london .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
so the idea is , again , imagine that we can engage people with something to do , and to change the environment -- almost like we call it , cloud movement as you can , but with a cloud .
imagine that everybody can give a little donation for an image .
i think that the remarkable thing about what happens for the last decades is that we have changed from a physical world to a digital world .
it has digitized everything , knowledge , and makes it available by the internet .
today , for the first time , we can -- and the campaign has shown this -- we can do it from the digital world , from the organizing forces of the networks to the physical world .
that can be in our case that we use it to design and create a symbol .
this is something that &apos;s built in the city .
but tomorrow , to give us the next challenges -- think about climate change or co2 emissions -- how can we change from the digital world to the physical ?
so the idea is that we actually bring people together , in which they do things together .
the cloud is again a cloud of imagery , in the same way that a real cloud is a cloud of particles .
and these particles are water , as our cloud is a cloud from image points .
it &apos;s a physical form in london , but with imaging points .
you can move inside and make different kinds of experiences .
you can actually look at it from the bottom , which is the most important moments for olympic 2012 and darover , and it &apos;s a kind of connection to the community .
so both the physical cloud in the sky and something that you can go to the top of it , like london new mountain summit .
you can go inside .
and a kind of digital look at the night -- but as most important , a new kind of experience for all that want to go to the top .
thank you .
as an artist , i &apos;m very important .
through my work , i try to express that people are not separated from nature and that everything is connected .
the first time i was in antarctica 10 years ago , where i saw my first ice mountains .
i worried awe .
my heart , my heart , was faldelig , while i tried to grab what was going on .
the ice mountains around me racked 60 feet from the water , and i was able to just wonder that this was a snowflake on a different snow .
ice mountains are born as the calb of a glacier or by breaking out of ice cream .
every ice mountain has its own individual personality .
they &apos;re interacting with their environment and their experiences .
some of them are going to give up and pass up until the bitter end , while others don &apos;t get more and more dramatic in a case .
if you look at an ice mountain , you think that they &apos;re isolated , separated and alone , as we often see people .
but the truth is far away from that .
now , during an ice mountain , i wind up its foretime atmosphere .
as the ice ice melts , it &apos;s mineral rich drinking water , which has a lot of life .
i go to my footage of these ice mountains as if i was going to make portraits of my ancestors , where consciousness , that you can see in these individual moments , and never exist again .
it &apos;s not a death , if you melt ; it &apos;s not the end , it &apos;s an ongoing state of your pathways .
a part of the ice in the ice mountains that i was a very young -- some thousand years old .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
the last pictures i &apos;d like to show you is a ice mountain that i &apos;d like to show in clubs in greenland .
very rarely , you &apos;re actually witnessing a wheelberg iceberg .
here it is .
on the left , you see a little boat .
that &apos;s about five feet long .
please look at the shape of the iceberg and where it &apos;s in the water line .
you can see here , he starts running , and the boat has moved to the other side , the man is there .
this is the average size of a mass iceberg .
it &apos;s about 120 feet from the water , or 40 feet .
and this video is in real time .
and just like that , you show a different page of your personality .
thank you .
my life is truly blessed by the work of some amazing projects .
but at the end of what i &apos;ve ever been working on , it was about this guy .
his name is fracking .
fracking was one of the leading graffiti artists in the &apos; 80s .
then one day , he came back from walking back and said , &quot; dad , my legs . &quot;
and that was the outbreak of the accident .
temple is completely paralyzed today .
it can only use his eyes .
i stood up to him .
so i have a company that makes design and animation , so it &apos;s essentially a complex part of what we admire in the art of art and attention .
so we decided , tony -- temple -- and his thing to support .
i met with his father and his brother and he said , &quot; we &apos;ll give you this money .
what are you going to do with this ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk back to tony .
i just want to go back to him and ask me , &quot; wait a minute , is this not -- i &apos;ve seen stephen hawking -- can &apos;t all of the paralyzed people communicate using these devices ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , just if you heard about a higher layer , and a remarkable insurance can really do that .
normal people are not available . &quot;
and i said , &quot; well , how do you communicate ? &quot;
did anybody see the movie &quot; butterand deaf bell ? &quot;
so they communicate -- so their fingers walk along .
i said , &quot; very archacally , how can that be ? &quot;
so i came up with the need , just to put a check , and instead , i put a check out of that i didn &apos;t know that i was supposed to solve .
i commit to the place , and at the end of his brother , and his father -- with the words , &quot; well , my proposal is this : tony will speak , we &apos;ll get a device and we &apos;ll find a way of doing his art .
because it &apos;s a farce that someone who &apos;s still involved in it , it can &apos;t communicate . &quot;
so i talked about a few months later .
i met these people from grel , graffiti research lab , and they have a technology that allows them to put a light on every surface of any surface , and then to draw with a laser triangle that &apos;s just affecting the negative space .
so they pull around and they make art installations like this .
they say all things that are shown up there will follow a life cycle .
it starts with the sex , then the radiant words , after the bush rains , and finally the people are doing art .
but there was always a life cycle in your presentation .
so i went home , and i went home with my wife and i told her about everything and we thought , &quot; well , second time , if there &apos;s this technology , you can use your eyes to control things , then we should find a laser a laser . it would be brilliant . &quot;
that was the beginning of the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a lot of organization and a lot of things , we &apos;ve done some things .
first , we &apos;ve dropped the insurance doors , and actually have a device to get a device that he can communicate with -- a stephen hawkger machine .
that was incredible .
and he &apos;s really , really funny -- i call him yoda , because you talk to him , or you get an email , and thinks , &quot; i &apos;m so unworthy , this guy is incredible . &quot;
we also have seven programmers from all over the world -- literally from all over the world -- to us home .
my wife , my children and i are raised in the garage , and these hackers and programmers and the programmers and a conspiracy have taken our house .
many of our friends thought we were beautiful to do that and that we were coming back and we were all about the walls on the walls .
but for over two weeks , we &apos;ve been programmed , we went to the radio sample in venice , my children were involved , my dog , and we created this .
it &apos;s called eyewriter and you can see the description .
this is a cheap sunglasses that we bought on the radio proverade of venice , some copper wire and a few things from the building market and the electric trade .
we took a pin card , they put them apart , they put them on a led-light , and now we have a device that &apos;s freely available -- you can build it yourself , we put the code free , you can download the software free .
so we created a device that &apos;s completely freely free .
no insurance can make up .
no hospital .
every paralyzed can actually actually communicate with his eyes , or draw .
thank you .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back in temple room .
i love this picture because it &apos;s the room of somebody else and that &apos;s his room .
now , there &apos;s all this sort of thing about the big unveiling .
and after about a year of planning , two weeks of programmable work , nuodparties and making sewards , tony &apos;s first time after seven years .
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and he looks beyond his life support system .
we put his bed , so he can see it outside .
we set up a projector against a wall of the parking hospital .
and he drew again for the first time , in his family , and friends -- and you can only imagine what a feeling that was on the parking lot .
we also had to break up in the parking parking , so we felt like a part of the spray scene .
at the end of the sand he gave us an email with the content , &quot; for the first time , i &apos;ve drawn something .
i feel like i got stuck under water , and i finally pulled out of water , and i pulled up my head , so i can breathe . &quot;
isn &apos;t that mind-blowing ?
this is something like our fight cry .
it &apos;s holding us on the pole and we &apos;re going to move on .
and we have to improve a lot of this device .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s a magic panel .
and someone who has such an artistic potential deserves so much more .
so we &apos;re trying to figure out how to make it better , faster and stronger .
since that time , we &apos;ve got all kinds of recognition .
we won a couple of awards .
remember , it &apos;s free , none of us deserve .
it &apos;s all from our own pockets .
so the drawings were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
armstrong twitter was talking about us and then in december , the time magazine honored to be honored when one of the 50 best inventions was in 2010 .
the coolest thing about this -- and that includes the whole circle -- that it will give this april in the city of los angeles in the city of los angeles , called &quot; sort of the streets . &quot;
and there &apos;s probably so much the hardest representative of the road art scene there -- banking , shepard , cawws , caws -- all these guys are going to be there .
fracking is going to be part of the show , which is pretty rough .
so basically , when you see something that is impossible , it &apos;s possible .
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this microphone , the eyewriter -- everything was impossible .
make it possible -- you all here .
i &apos;m not a programmer , and i &apos;ve never had anything to do with oydents technology , but i &apos;ve just got something to do with amazing people so that we could put something together in the legs .
and that question should be all of you , and at any single day , where you noticed something that needs to be done , if not now , when ? and if not i , who ?
thank you .
so , i write for kids , and i &apos;m probably america &apos;s most likely child book writer .
and i &apos;m always saying the people i don &apos;t want to get as a scientist .
you can have me as a farmer , or in leather , but no one has ever elected farmers .
today , i want to tell you about circles and disagreement .
well , an epiphany is usually something you find because you drop it somewhere .
you go to the block and you take it as a revelation .
this is a painting of a circle .
one of my friends has made it -- richard bollywood .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle that i want to tell you today .
my circle began in the &apos; 60s at high school in stow , ohio , where i was the classroom .
i was the one who was beaten every week in the juvenile toilet and blue until a teacher saved my life .
she saved my life by using the toilet in teacher &apos;s room .
they did it .
she did it for three years .
and i had to look out of town .
i had a thumb , i had 85 dollars , and it proposed to me to san francisco in california -- i found a lover -- and then i found it in the &apos; 80s in the &apos; 80s .
about three or four years ago , i received a call in the middle of the night of this teacher , writer , who said , &quot; i have to see it .
i &apos;m sad that we &apos;ve never met each other as adults .
can you please come to ohio , and please come together with the guy i know you &apos;ve found .
and i should say , i &apos;ve got a lot of construction glals , and i want you to look at it . &quot;
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
we looked at them , we laughed , we cried , and we knew they had to be in a hospice .
we found one for them , we brought them down , and we went around and we gave them , and we gave them eight , because they needed it .
it was something we knew .
and just as the woman was trying to learn me as adults , i learned it turned out to be filled in a box , and put it in my hands .
what happened was that the circle had closed , it was a circle -- and the revelation of that i spoke to .
the revelation is that death is part of life .
she saved my life , and my partner and i saved her .
and you know , this part of life needs everything the rest of life needs .
he needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so happy that this is often mentioned here .
he needs the same way -- he would need , love and pleasure , and it &apos;s about giving these things .
thank you .
imagine a big explosion , as you move on 1,000 feet .
imagine a plane full of smoke .
imagine a engine , the blade , tripack , trigs , trigs , trigs , swack .
that sounds scary .
well , i had a unique place that day ; i was sitting on 1d .
i was the only person to talk to the airplane .
so i looked at it right now , and they said , &quot; no problem , we may have caught some birds . &quot;
the pilot had already demonstrated the machine , and we weren &apos;t so far away .
you could see manhattan .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
the pilot made the machine from the hudson river .
it &apos;s usually not route .
it stops the engine .
imagine a sound plane .
and then he said three words -- the smartest words i &apos;ve ever heard .
he says , &quot; let &apos;s do it . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the borsy staff .
i could see it in her eyes , there was horror , life was at the end .
i want to share with you three things that i &apos;ve learned about me this day .
i learned that in a moment everything is different .
we have this life plan , we have these things that we want to do in life , and i thought about all the people i wanted to make a hand , and it didn &apos;t work , all the tough ones i wanted to make and never did .
while i was thinking about it later , i fell a saying , which is , &quot; i collect bad whales . &quot;
because when the wine is , and the person is there , i open it up .
i never want to move anything in life .
and this urgency , this goal , has really changed my life .
the second thing i learned about this day -- and that was when we launched the george washington bridge , pretty much about hair &apos;s width -- i thought , there &apos;s one thing i really thought there is .
i had a good life .
in my own humanity , and with my mistakes , i applied to getting better in everything i was doing .
but in my humanity , i &apos;ve given myself my ego .
and i took the time that i wasted for meaningful things , with people who mean something .
and i thought about the relationship with my wife to friends , to people .
and after that , when i thought about it , i decided that i decided to put negative energy from my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
i didn &apos;t wear two years in my wife .
it feels great .
i &apos;m not trying to get more right ; i decide to be happy .
the third thing i learned -- that &apos;s when the inner clock starts , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 , 13 . &quot;
you see the water coming .
i said , &quot; please fly into the air . &quot;
i don &apos;t want this thing to break in 20 parts as you know it from documstrations .
while we fall down , i had this feeling , man , to die .
almost as if we were preparing our lives for a long time .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and that sadness really is in a thought , which is that i just wish one thing .
i wish i could grow my children .
about a month after , i visited a performance of my daughter -- first graders , not much artistic talent ...
not .
and i &apos;m packing , i &apos;m like a little kid .
and in the world , everything was a sense of me .
i realized that by the time i got the dots together , it was just about being a great father .
more than anything , everything else is my only goal to be a good father .
i became a miracle of dying that day .
i got another gift , which is to see the future , and go back and live differently .
my call to all that fly today is : imagine that the same thing happens on your flight -- please not -- but imagine it , and how would you change ?
what would you do that you &apos;re going to do , because you think you &apos;re there forever ?
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in it ?
and more than anything else , are you the best parents you can just be ?
thank you .
the idea behind the stuxnet computer worm is pretty simple .
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bomb .
the most important thing for the development of nuclear weapons is the ancient incentives in nato .
the gray boxes that you see here are real-time control systems .
now , if we can do that , the systems , which are the numbers and the valves , then we can actually create a lot of problems with this centrifuge .
these gray boxes are not running with wind software ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
but if we can do it , a more effective wind virus on a laptop is used to be used by a warping engineer to disprove this gray box , then we &apos;re in business .
and this is the planning behind stuxnet .
so we start with a winy dropper .
the use of data is transgenerated into the gray box , damaged the centrifuge , and the iroriginal nuclear energy program is taking place .
that &apos;s a car game , right ?
i want to tell you how we found that .
when we started studying our research six months ago , it was completely unknown what the meaning and purpose of this procedure was .
the only thing we knew is very , very complicated , which is the winding part , the drone -- part of it , he made up by subjects .
and it seemed to have something to do with these gray boxes , that real-time control systems .
this is our attention , and we started a lab project , where we infected our environment with stuxnet infected , and we studied this constructed .
and then something weird happened .
gexnet negotiated like a laboratory rat that didn &apos;t like our cheese -- sniffed , but didn &apos;t want to eat it .
it didn &apos;t make sense in my eyes .
and after we were experimenting with different kinds of cheese , i went to see that this is a one-eyed attack .
completely on a certain destination .
the dropper is active on the gray box , when a special configuration was discovered , even if the special program , which is trying to infect it .
and if not , nothing does nothing .
so , the ticking really my interest and we started working , almost around the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
it could be , for example , an american power plant , or a chemical plant in germany .
so we should soon find out what the goal is .
so , extrators and decompited , we found the attack code code and found that it &apos;s built in two digital warheads -- a smaller and larger one .
and we also realized that they were constructed very professionally , from people who obviously had all the pluders .
they knew all bits and bytes that they had to attack .
they even knew the shoe size of the machine .
so they knew everything .
and if you &apos;ve got , you know , the drone of stuxnet complex and high-tech is , let me tell you , the use of data is a science for itself .
it &apos;s much more sophisticated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
here you see a clip from this attack code .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 lines of code .
it looks pretty much like owners .
and i want to tell you how we were able to be able to be smart from this code .
so after what we were looking at as the first , systems function , because we know what this is doing .
and then we were looking for tien and data structures and trying to bring these to the real world -- with potential goals in the real world .
so we needed theories about these goals that we could demonstrate or dissect .
in order to make this theories , we call ourselves in memory that it &apos;s definitely about high-level sabotage , it has to be a high-quality goal , and it &apos;s very likely to be in iran because most of the infections have been killed .
now , in this area , there &apos;s not several thousand targets .
in fact , it &apos;s going out on the buke of nuclear power , and it &apos;s the uranium facility in nato .
so i said to my assistant , &quot; bring me a list of all experts for centridity and abuse of our client . &quot;
and i called them and drove their knowledge to know what to do with what we found in the code and in the data .
and that worked very well .
so , it was possible to get the small digital warhead associated with the rotorcontrols .
the rotor is this moving part within the centrifuge , these black object that you see .
and if you manipulate the speed of this rother , you &apos;re actually able to crack the rotor , and finally , the centrifuge explode .
what we &apos;ve also found is that the goal of the attack was actually to make it happen , and it &apos;s incredibly accurate -- obviously trying to leave engineers , so they wouldn &apos;t be able to get quickly behind it .
the great digital warhead -- we got a glimpse by looking very closely at data and data structures .
so for example , the number of 164 styles are very out of this code ; you can &apos;t miss it .
i started working with scientific literature , which is how this centridity was built in natasha and found out that they are structured in what kaskaden , and every kaskade contains 164 centridity .
so that made sense to fit it together .
and it was even better .
this centridity in iran is divided into 15 levels .
and guess what we &apos;ve found in the attack code ?
almost identical structure .
so again , that &apos;s really good together .
and that gave us great confidence for what we studied here .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , not just that .
these results were done by several weeks hard work .
and often we just run in a dead store and we just had to collect it .
anyway , we found that both digital warheads in reality were actually on one and the same target , but from various directions .
the little warhead takes a caskade , and overlines , and slowed down and slowed down and the big warhead starts with six kaskads in interaction and manipulating .
so , in the big and all of us , we &apos;re very hopeful , actually , what the goal is .
it &apos;s natasha and it &apos;s just nato .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that others could be met by gexnet .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we discovered -- has really come out of the sow .
there &apos;s the gray box down there , and it &apos;s looking at the centridity .
now , what this thing is doing is that it &apos;s beginning to decrease the amount of sensors -- for example , of printing sensors and vibrational sensors -- and it provides legitimate code , which is going on during the attack , with false data .
and in fact , this false set of data is taken from stuxnet before .
so it &apos;s just like in hollywood movies , where it &apos;s going to be fed by the surveillance of surveillance , with the propentions of surveillance videos .
that &apos;s cool , isn &apos;t it ?
the idea of this is obviously not just the machine operator in the control room .
in fact , it &apos;s much dangerous and more aggressive .
the idea is to overlist a digital security system .
we need digital security systems where a human machine worker can &apos;t respond fast enough .
so in a power station , for example , if the big steam turbine becomes too quick , you &apos;ve got to open it inside of milliseconds .
of course , this can &apos;t be done by a human machine leaders .
so at this point we need digital security systems .
and when the endangered is , then really bad things happen .
the power power can explode .
and neither the media leaders , the security system will notice it .
that &apos;s scary .
but it gets worse .
and what i &apos;m saying now is very important .
think about it . this is generic .
it has nothing to do with centridity , with uranium wealth .
so , for example , it would work so well -- in a power plant or a car factory .
it &apos;s generic .
and you don &apos;t have to -- when the sales -- you don &apos;t have to get the benefit of the data over a usxnet , like we saw at stuxnet .
you could also use ordinary worm technology to spread .
you just have to spread it as far as possible .
and when you do that , you get a cyberweapon of mass destruction .
that &apos;s the consequence we have to imagine .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of goals are not in the middle east .
they &apos;re in the united states , in europe and japan .
so all of these green areas , these are the richest environments .
we have to put the consequences and we &apos;re going to start getting better .
thank you .
i have a question .
ralph , it became a lot of it that people assume that the mossad is the main organization behind it .
is that your opinion ?
okay , you really want to know ?
yeah . okay .
my opinion is the mossad , but the driving force is not israel .
so the driving force is the cyber superpower .
there &apos;s only one and that &apos;s the united states -- fortunately , for happiness .
because otherwise our problem would be even bigger .
thank you for having a fear of fear . thank you ralph .
i spent the last few years studying myself in situations that usually are very difficult and somehow dangerous .
i went to jail -- difficult .
i worked in a coal factory -- dangerous .
i filmed in war areas -- difficult and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days trying to eat nothing like this -- fun at the beginning , a little bit difficult in the middle , very dangerous at the end .
in fact , i &apos;ve exposed the largest part of my career to terrible situations , and that &apos;s all just for trying to study social care that they &apos;re most compelling and interesting , and hopefully in a way that makes them fun for the audience .
so when i knew that i was going to come here to look at a tedtalk the world of branding and sponds , i knew i would do something a little different .
some of you may have heard that i turned off a couple of weeks ago at ebay .
i sent a couple of facebook messages , some twitter messages , and i gave people the opportunity to stand on my tedtalk 2011 .
really , some happy people and companies , disciplders and non-verbal , got the unique opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris anderson never will let the talk again -- the name of buying the issue that was actually going to be .
so what you got was this : you put your tedtalk here : my tedtalk , from which you don &apos;t know what the subject will be , and the one who could ever be after the content to the ears , especially if i &apos;m stupid .
but even apart , it &apos;s a very good way of meditation .
you know how many people look at these tedtalks ?
a whole lot .
this is just the work of the labor .
so despite that warning , i knew anybody would buy the rights rights .
now if you had asked me this one year ago , i wouldn &apos;t have been able to tell you that with certainty .
but in the new project that i work on , my new film , we study the world of marketing , advertising .
now , as i said , i went to some pretty awful situations over the years , but nothing could prepare me , nothing i could do , to make nothing so hard and so dangerous with these guys .
you know , i had the idea for a movie .
what i want to do is a film about the level of magnitude , marketing and advertising , where the whole film is funded by product customization , marketing and advertising .
and the film is called &quot; the tinkering . &quot;
so what happens is that , in the &quot; the blend , &quot; is that , from the top up to the end , from the beginning to the end , it &apos;s completely covered by brands -- the cover you &apos;re going to see in the movie , that &apos;s the brand .
now this brand , exccomm stadium , which is the action center ...
these people will be connected to the movie , forever .
and so the film is going to study this whole idea -- that &apos;s what ? in eternal , forever ?
i &apos;m an redundant person .
that was more concrete .
it was &quot; eternal , forever . &quot;
but we will not only have the brand as a cover , but we &apos;ll make sure that we &apos;re going to sell every possible category in the movie .
so maybe we &apos;re selling a shoe and he &apos;s going to sell the greatest shoe you ever ever wore ...
the greatest car you ever have , from &quot; the dodgers ever rehab , &quot; which you &apos;ve ever had , a attention of &quot; the tinkering . &quot;
so the idea is , besides showing that brands are part of the life , actually , to provide the film ?
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
the goal of the whole film is transparency .
you &apos;ll see the whole thing in the movie of prostate kingdom .
so this is the whole concept , the whole film , from the beginning to the end .
and i would enjoy if ceg would help this .
you know , it &apos;s funny , because when i first heard it , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience .
i don &apos;t know what people will be like .
do you have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use &quot; angle , &quot; because this has a negative connotation -- but you know how to develop it ?
how much money is needed to realize that ?
1.5 million .
i think it &apos;s hard to meet , but i think it &apos;s worth it in every case , some really familiar brands .
who knows when the movie comes out , we might look like a lide vollidiust .
what do you think the answer is ?
the answer is most likely no .
but is it a difficult thing about the film or a difficult thing to me ?
jk : both .
so ... so , not so optimistic .
so , sir , you can help me ? i need help .
i can help .
okay .
fantastic .
we need to think about what brands .
yeah .
if you look at the people who you have to do .
there are some places that we can apply to .
imagine the camera .
i thought , &quot; imagine the camera , &quot; that we wanted to have a background conversation .
it turns out it meant it , &quot; we don &apos;t want to do anything with your film . &quot;
and just that , all these companies disappeared , one after another .
no one wanted to do something with the movie .
i was amazed .
they didn &apos;t want to do anything with the project .
and i was confused , because i thought the whole concept of advertising was the idea of advertising , your product as many people as possible as possible .
especially in the world today , at this intersection of new and old media , and the body media landscape -- it &apos;s not the idea of being in this new exciting device , that the masses of this message is .
no , that was what i thought .
but look , the problem was that my idea had a sweet mistake , and that was the following .
actually , no , it wasn &apos;t the mistake at all .
that would have been no problem at all .
that would have been okay .
but what this picture is , is a problem .
you see , if you put transparency in google , that &apos;s one of the first images that seems .
i really like your way , sergey brin .
that was the problem : transparency -- free of deception and cardboard , just to discover and look through , immediately , acting , acting from perspective and access to information , especially what business business -- the last line is certainly the biggest problem .
you know , we &apos;re now listening to a whole bunch of transparency .
our politicians say it , our president says it , even our ceo .
but when it comes to it , it &apos;s supposed to change something .
but why ? well , transparency is scary -- like this strange bear , still smokes .
it &apos;s unpredictable -- like this strange land .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
what else is that risky ?
a whole dish cool .
this is very risky .
so when i started talking to the companies and tell them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to be a story .
we want you to be a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
see , when i was a kid , and my father turned me into lying -- and he &apos;s sitting there , and he &apos;s looking at me -- he would say , &quot; my son , there &apos;s three versions .
there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the real version . &quot;
so you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the real version .
but there &apos;s only one company that was prepared to help us -- and that &apos;s just because i &apos;ve known john bond and richard kirshentree for years -- i found that i had to do it alone , and i had to deal with my team .
so what you suddenly started to understand -- or what i started to understand -- was that if you start talking with these companies , the idea of how your brand gets understood , a bigger problem .
i have friends who make great , giant hollywood movies , and i have friends who are little striev-films like me .
and my friends , the great , big hollywood movies , are saying that the reason why their films are so successful , in the brand partners they have .
and then my friends , who are doing little catev-films , &quot; well , how are we going to compete with these big , gigantic hollywood films ? &quot;
and the film is called &quot; the tinkering . &quot;
so how exactly are we going to see ban in the movie ?
whenever i do it on the way , and whenever i open the medical closet , you &apos;ll see ban deodorant .
and every time i interview someone , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ?
are you ? you see a little nervous .
i want to help you calm down .
so maybe you should put a little bit of this on the interview . &quot;
and then we offer one of these great chilons .
either &quot; fln fusion &quot; or &quot; paradise wind , &quot; they &apos;ll have choice .
we &apos;re driven to both men as well as women and for women -- , in fact , on , or a stick , whatever .
that &apos;s the short amount .
now , i can answer all of your questions and give you an excuse .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
as you &apos;ve been talking about the smaller movies , we &apos;re a very challenging .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other brands .
so to make these things -- you know , people remember ban -- that &apos;s sort of why we &apos;re interested .
what words would you describe ?
ban is tinkering .
that &apos;s a great question .
woman &apos;s technology .
technology is not the way you should describe something that someone &apos;s supposed to do .
we talk about bold , fresh .
i think &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word that this particular category is really doing something positive , unlike fighting odor and humidity .
it keeps you fresh .
how can we keep them longer -- better fresh , more fresh , three times more ?
these things have a more positive effect .
and this is a million corporation .
what about me ? what about the prints ?
i have to talk to the guy on the street that &apos;s like me , otto-normal consumers .
you should tell me something about my brand .
how would you describe your brand ?
hmmm , my brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i really like beautiful clothes .
in &apos; 80s , he meets skate responses , except the washing day .
all right , what is the brand ?
unique .
i think the gene that i &apos;ve got is &quot; dark glamour . &quot;
i like a lot of black colors , lots of gray sounds and so on .
but usually i have a accessories , like sunglasses , or a jewelry and something like that .
if dan was a brand , he would probably be a classic merceder walrio .
man 2 : the brand i &apos;m , i would say , nigue fly .
woman 2 : part of hippie , partly yogi , part of the frost -- i don &apos;t know .
man 3 : i &apos;m the bemuseum guy .
i sell a museum animals throughout the country .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
this is my brand in my little , distorted industry .
man 4 : my brand is fedex , because i was free .
man five : brand failed alcoholes write .
is that ?
lawyer : i &apos;m an anca stamp .
i &apos;m tom .
well , we can &apos;t all be the tom-brand brand , but i often look at the interface of darkglamour and worger fly .
and what &apos;s realized was that i needed a experts .
i needed somebody who could get into my head , someone who could really help me understand what you call &quot; brand personality . &quot;
and so i found a company called olson zold .
they &apos;ve helped companies like nezzy , hallbreke , hallmark , to discover this brand personality .
if you could do it , you could also help me .
they brought their pictures , yes ?
i have this . the first picture is a picture of my family .
just tell me a little bit about how that is connected to your thoughts and feelings about you .
these are the people who form my view of view .
tell me about this world .
md : this world ? i think the world is the world in which you live -- how people around you , the friends , the family , the way you live life , the work and the work .
all of these things come from and start from a place , and for me , and start with my family in west virginia .
what &apos;s next to you want to talk about .
the next . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
what context is that to mind and feelings about yourself ?
it &apos;s like i &apos;d like to be .
i like things that are different .
i like things that are special . i like weird things .
tell me about the &quot; why &quot; phase -- what does it bring us ?
what &apos;s the machete ? what puppet you are right now ?
why is it important to start novelty ? what represents the red ?
tell me a little bit about this part .
a little more about you , not you .
what other metals have they gone through ?
you don &apos;t have to be afraid . what kind of achteraster are you ?
eeeeee ! no , thank you .
thank you very much for your patience .
yeah . well . okay .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to be like .
there &apos;s a lot of crazy things going on .
the first thing i saw was this idea that their brand paint was two separate , but it turned out to be -- the morgan is a eight-/ light brand brand .
add very good .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction .
and i think some companies are going to focus on a strength rather than both of them .
many companies tend to -- and that &apos;s the human nature -- to avoid things where they &apos;re not safe , they &apos;re going to avoid fear , these elements , and that &apos;s what they &apos;re going to be called , and they actually turn them into something positive , and that &apos;s a layered chess .
what other brands are doing ?
the first one is a classician , apple .
and you can also see this , target , wii , mini of mini coopers and jetblue .
now , there are tags , and eight-times brands , these things that come and go , but one of them played , eight , a half is a pretty strong thing .
one eight-hour , did brand play . how is your brand ?
if someone asked them to describe their brand identity , their brand , how would they be ?
you put them up there ? are you something that brings your blood into wet ?
or are they more likely to lower ?
are you something that &apos;s a little quiet , a little quiet , more conservative ?
and the attributes are things that are hidden , like the fresh prince , according to the adventure , the adventurous , outfall and love like eromn , agile and agile like gandalf .
or are they more like a downstatic ?
are you eight thirds and mongls like 1,000 ?
are you organized , traditionally , use , protective , compassionately like oprah ?
are they reliable , stable , family , safe , definitely born , excitement and way like the dalai lama ?
over the course of the movie we had more than 500 companies who were up and down and down and they said , &quot; no , they didn &apos;t want to be part of the project .
they didn &apos;t want to do anything with this movie , because they didn &apos;t have control , no control over the finished product .
but , in fact , 17 brand partners who were willing to give up on this control , who wanted to do business with somebody like this , wanted to take care and play like i was , and to tell us the stories that we usually didn &apos;t have -- stories that would never support .
they used us to tell the story of the neuromarketing story , as we tell the story in this movie , that you &apos;re using mri today to take the lustcenters of the brain , both to make advertising as well as films and films .
we went to sao paulo , where the foreign advertising was banned .
in the entire city for five years , they have no poster , no poster , no spacecraft , nothing .
and we drove in school district , where companies are moving their way into the schools , in very america .
the incredible thing for me is that the projects i got most of the feedback , or where i had the greatest success , those are where i started interacting with things .
and that &apos;s what these brands have done .
because they went to the mediterranean , they went to the authorities , and they said that the agencies might not really have their interest in purpose .
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artist directly .
i &apos;m going to work with him and create something completely different , something that people can do to think that our world is challenging .
and how was that for you ? what do you succeed ?
now , since the movie movie film festival , we can look at this .
according to burreller was the first time in january , and since then -- and that &apos;s not even the whole thing -- there was 900 million remarks of this film .
this is actually one of two weeks from two weeks .
this is just online -- no press , no television .
the film was still not balanced .
it doesn &apos;t even have it online . no manual .
he &apos;s not gone out in other countries .
well , finally , the film has a very big momentum .
and that &apos;s not bad for a project where almost every commercial agency that we talked about has recommended with their clients , the fingers of that .
something that i think is what i think is that if you get your chance to get risks , you get risks in these risks .
i think if you stop people , you get them closer to failure .
i think that if you train your employees to avoid risks , you &apos;ve prepared the whole company to get a profit .
i feel that we need to encourage people to take risks .
we need to encourage people to have no fear of possibilities that you might be afraid of .
finally , we should be welcome to fear .
we should put the bear in the cage .
they welcome the fear . they welcome to the risk .
one big lion , so we welcome the risk .
and finally , we should welcome transparency .
today , more than ever before , give us a little bit of honesty .
and that said , with honesty and transparency , my entire talk &quot; is welcome to transparency , &quot; they presented by my good friends , who paid $ 7100 for the name of ebay .
big data will be turned into large opportunities around the world .
emc : &quot; you welcome transparency &quot;
thank you .
now , morgan , in the name of transparency , what &apos;s going on with the $ 7100 ?
that &apos;s a great question .
i &apos;ve got a check in my pocket , on top of the ted organization of the ted organization , the saop foundation -- a check in the height of $ 7100 to provide my ted performance next year .
my name is amit .
18 months ago , i was doing something different at google , and i went to do something with museums and art . my cheracy , which is now , i had green light .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of fun negotiations and stories that i can tell you about , 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the show .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we &apos;ve done this .
i think my personal view is very simple to explain with this slide and access .
i grew up in india .
i became a great training part -- i didn &apos;t use myself -- but i had not had access to many museums and i didn &apos;t work .
when i traveled , and these museums come to visit , i started learning a lot .
and while i was working for google , i was trying to look at this desire -- to make art accessible with technology .
we then put a team , a great team , and we started with it .
i &apos;m going to start with the demonstration , and tell you some interesting things that happened since the start .
so you &apos;re just going to be a conservative project.com.
you can see in all these museums here .
there &apos;s the uffizi , the moma , the rickets , the rijks , the van gogh .
i even come in one of my favorite , the metropolitan museum of art in new york .
you come in two ways -- very simple .
click , you &apos;re in this museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where they are -- bombay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t make any difference .
you go around and you &apos;re familiar .
you want to be in the museum ?
open the map , and jump with a click .
they &apos;re in there , they want to end up .
only further . a lot of fun .
hold them .
thank you , but the best one is coming .
so now i &apos;m in front of one of my favorite pictures , a torter of beuils in the met .
i see this plusmark .
if the museum gave us the picture , they click on it .
now this is one of the images .
this is all metadata .
those of you who are really interested in art can click here -- but i click away now .
this is one of the images we &apos;ve captured with the so-called &quot; gigapixel technology . &quot;
for example , this picture is about 10 billion points , i think .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you get for 10 billion points ? &quot;
that &apos;s what i &apos;ll show you now .
you can zoom in very easily and zoom out .
you see something funny here .
i love this guy ; his expression is unaffordable .
but then they really want to go deep .
and so i started playing around , and i realized that there was something going on there .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
i went close , and i realized slowly that these kids actually beat something .
i was talking a little bit about a couple of familiar people in the met , and actually , it turns out that it &apos;s a game called fleail , which is a goose at the bottom of a stick .
it seemed quite popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
to really go close to that , you can go to the wild .
just to give you a picture of that , i find out what you &apos;re getting .
here we were , and this is the painting .
the best thing is , but in a second .
let &apos;s jump fast to moma , again in new york .
another favorite picture of me , star night .
at the very best example , it was about finding details .
but what if you want to see the pint ?
and what if you want to see van gogh of this masterpiece ?
you zoom in . you can really go in .
i &apos;m going to zoom in one of my favorite trees of this picture , until i really am in the wild .
this is star night , probably never seen before .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
there are many more , but i don &apos;t have time .
this is the really cool part , it &apos;s called &quot; collections . &quot;
every one of them , every -- if you &apos;re rich or poor , whether you have a great house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
you can go and create your own museum online , and from all these images you can put your own collection .
simple , you go in -- and i &apos;ve created this , it &apos;s called the power of the biotechnology -- you can zoom around .
this is it , in the national versions .
you can put it all on note , send your friends and start a conversation on what you feel when you look at these masterpieces .
i think , finally , the main thing for me is that all the wonderful things don &apos;t come from google .
they &apos;re not even coming out of the museums .
i should not say that .
they come from artists .
and that was an experience in humility for me .
i mean , i hope that we &apos;re going to be doing this with this digital medium of art , and they &apos;re quite right online .
the biggest question that i recently asked : &quot; did you do that to replicate the experience of a museum visit ? &quot;
the answer is no .
it &apos;s supposed to add the experience .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . thank you .
thank you .
this is a representation of your brain . your brain can be split in two camps .
this is the left half , which is the logical side , and then the right half that the intuitive side is .
if we would have a scale to measure the ap- every hemisphere , we could tell her the brain .
for example , this one would be the one who &apos;s completely logical .
this would be someone who &apos;s completely intuitive .
now , where would you relate your brain to this scale ?
some of us may have chosen for one of these extreme , but i think that , for most people in the audience , the brain looks like this -- with a high aphost , the same thing in both hemisphere .
it &apos;s not like they &apos;re both exclusive or so on .
you can be logical and intuitive .
and so i think of myself as one of the people in common with most other experimental quantum physicists that need a good fraction of logic to bring the complex ideas together .
but at the same time we need a good fraction of intuition to actually perform experiments .
how do we develop this intuition ? well , we love to play with things .
so we go out and we &apos;re going to go out and see how it follows , and then we start to develop our intuition .
basically , they do the same thing .
so one of the intuitive ones that you &apos;ve developed is probably that one thing can be at the same time at a time .
i mean , it may sound strange to think about a thing at the same time in two different places , but they were not born with this idea .
i remember watching a child at a bottom of the ground .
he was a little kid and not very good at it , and he fell down constantly .
but i bet that play is a very valuable lesson at the bottom of the ground , which is the big things you don &apos;t just teach , and that you stay at a point .
and this is a great conceptual model of the world , so long they &apos;re not a particle physicist .
it would be a horrible model for a particle physicist , because they don &apos;t have to play with soil , but with these little odd particles .
and if you play with your particles , you have all kinds of weird things -- like you fly directly through walls , or you can be at the same time at two different places .
and so they all wrote these observations , and they called them the theory of quantum mechanics .
this was the state of physics several years ago ; you needed quantum mechanics to describe the little tiny particles .
but you didn &apos;t need them to describe the great everyday objects around us .
this has not liked my intuition , and maybe just because i &apos;m not so often with particles .
well , i sometimes play with you , but not very often .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
i mean , nobody ever saw a particle .
but my logical aspect of it has not liked it .
because if all of these things are out of particles and all these particles the rules of quantum mechanics , then they shouldn &apos;t just follow the rules of quantum mechanics ?
i don &apos;t see why it shouldn &apos;t be that way .
so i &apos;d better feel more accurate with the whole thing , if we could somehow show that everyday objects also could follow the rules of quantum mechanics .
so i did a couple of years ago , just to do that .
i created one .
this is the first object you can see , in the quantum mechanical superposition .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and you can see that green dot there in the middle .
this is the piece of metal that i &apos;m going to talk about .
this is a picture of the object .
here i am . we look at the center here .
and here &apos;s a really big close-up of this little piece of metal .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little bit of metal that &apos;s like a spring board , and it &apos;s over the edge .
so i made this thing in similar ways to make a computer chip .
i went to a clean space with new fields , and racked for 100 hours of all the big devices .
for the last bit , i had to build my own machine -- to make this kind of a swim pool and get the thing .
this thing has the ability to be in the quantum mechanical superposition but it takes a little help to do it .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you know how uncomfortable it is in a full elevator ?
i mean , if i &apos;m alone in the elevator , i &apos;m going to do all kinds of weird things , but then other people get up and i &apos;m listening to all these things because i don &apos;t want to be comfortable with it , or , frankly , they &apos;re going to go .
so quantum mechanics says that unmoving objects are just as feeling .
the driver for immoving objects are not just people , but also the light that seems to you and the wind , the wind of the space , and the heat of the space .
and so we knew that if we wanted to see that this piece of metal is quantum mechanical , we had to throw out quantum tunneles .
and that &apos;s what we did .
we turned off the light , we put it into a vacuum , and it made the whole air out of it , and it was cooling up to almost almost , in the elevator , it was the piece of metal to behave like that .
so we measured his movement .
we found that it really sucks .
instead of just being there , it &apos;s going to vibrate . the way it vibracts it , it &apos;s about like this -- like a moving one and together , and together , and together , and together , more and more .
in which we gave him a little push , we could encourage it to illuminate at the same time and not illuminating -- something that &apos;s just in quantum mechanics .
so what i &apos;m telling you is what &apos;s truly fantastic .
what does it mean to illuminate for an object at the same time and not vibrating ?
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
so the first case : all of these trillions of atoms are still silent , and at the same time , the same atoms are moving up and down .
only more precise points are true .
they &apos;re the rest of the time .
that means that every atom at the same time is two different places , which is that the whole piece of metal is two different places .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
really .
it was worth taking me into the clean space for all this year , because , you know , the scale difference between one atom and this piece of metal is about the same as the difference between the metal and you .
so if a single atom can be at the same time at two different places , this piece of metal can be two different places , why not you ?
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logical page says .
so , imagine you &apos;re at the same time in several places , how would that feel ?
how would your consciousness handle that your body is in the room ?
there &apos;s another aspect of history .
when we opened up the lights , and the box looked down , we saw that the piece of metal was always in a piece .
and so i had to develop this new intuition that it looks like all the objects in the elevator actually are just very hot objects that are together in a small space .
you hear a lot about how quantum mechanics says that everything is connected to everything .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
there &apos;s more and deeper behind that .
it &apos;s that these connections , their connections with all the things around them , literally define who they are , and that &apos;s the profound and strange quantum mechanics .
thank you .
in 2007 , i decided that we should be able to rearrange how we think about economic development .
it should be our goal that when families think about where they live and they want to work , they give you the opportunity to choose between at least one hand full of different towns that are all in competition .
now we &apos;re far away from this goal .
there are billions of people in developing countries who don &apos;t even have a single city that they would welcome to .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they &apos;re so much more value than it costs them to build .
so we could be very simple in the world , maybe even hundreds of new cities .
this may sound absurd for you , unless you &apos;ve never thought about new cities .
you can just trade the building of apartments from cities .
imagine half the people who want to live in homes , did this already ; the other half still don &apos;t .
they could try to expand the capacity of the existing apartments .
but you know what they would be looking at , in these homes and their environment , to avoid the laws of influence and access .
so it turns out to be very hard to get out of all of these extended units .
but you could go to a completely new place , build a completely new residential block , and the laws would support such a building and not prevent it .
so i &apos;ve suggested that governments can create new surfaces that provide enough space for a city and gave them a name : charter cities .
i found out later that , in about the same time , ja4 and octavio about the challenge of reform in hong duras .
they knew that every year , about 75,000 honans left their country to go to the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to make sure that these people can stay in their country and do exactly the same thing in hong african .
in this point , jafour has said to octavio , &quot; what happens when we take an unsetted surface of our country , what if we just put them in a message -- a part of the american embassy , and if people want to work , they want to work , whatever they do to canada or america ? &quot;
in the summer of 2009 , honduras was suffering under a highly extensive violation .
in the next plangy election , peep lobo won in an equilibrium , whose program , both both innovation , promised .
he asked octavio to become a stable seat .
in the meantime i prepared myself to tedglobal .
through improvement , trying and through the study of consumers , i tried to reduce this complicated concept of charter city .
the first point is the importance of laws , laws that determine that you can &apos;t bother existing housing .
we pay for new technologies , but for the progress requires technologies and laws , and it &apos;s usually laws that keep us back .
in the fall 2010 , a friend of guatemala octavio was sending out the ted tedtalk .
again , he showed him ja4 .
the two calls me .
and said , &quot; let &apos;s present the head of our country ! &quot;
so we met in december of a hotels in miami .
i &apos;ve tried to make sure how valuable cities are , how much value they are as they cost .
and i used this chart to show how valuable it is in a place like new york . think about a surface in some cases per square square meter .
but it was a pretty abstract discussion , at a point when there was a pause , in octavio said , &quot; paul , maybe we could look at the tedtalk . &quot;
so the tedtalk asked in very simple shape that a charter city is a place whose early country is uninhabited , a green contract , the laws of the laws , which are there and the ability to decide to be able to live either under these rules or not .
and that &apos;s why i was asked by the president of honduras , who meant that we have to make this project , that it &apos;s important , and that this is our country .
i was asked to come to tegucia galpa , and at the fourth and fifth january a lecture .
so i &apos;ve given another thing with facts , which is a graph like this , which has been trying to prove that if you want to create a lot of value in a city , it must be a very large city .
this is a picture of the city , and the sketch represents the new airport , which was built in denver .
this airport alone has a surface of 100 square miles .
so i &apos;ve tried to convince the honans of this when you want to build a new city , you have to start with an area at least 1,000 square miles .
these are more than 250 thousand acres .
luckily , everybody applausts .
the face of the audience were very serious and careful .
the head of the convention came to the stage , and he said , &quot; professor romer , i thank you very much for your talk , but maybe you could look at the tedtalk .
i &apos;ve got it on my laptop . &quot;
so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk .
and i came to the core point that a new city gives people new possibilities .
there would be the opportunity to live in a city that &apos;s in hong duras , rather than hundreds of miles away from the north .
and a new city also includes new possibilities for leaders .
the leaders of the government , in hong duras , would depend on the help of schools , and they could benefit from their partner countries that they would get in the laws of the law and to support that the charter is really going to be unlocked .
and the realization of president lobo , was that the confidence of the consent that i &apos;ve been thinking about as a way to get the foreign investors and build this city could be significant for all the parties for many years .
we are in an area .
this picture is from this place .
it cuts a thousand square kilometers .
and shortly after that , at the 19th of january , they voted for a change of the constitution to have a disvoluted platform for the specific development areas .
in a country , which has just been a very strong crisis behind , in the congress , it was voted with 124 to a voice .
all the parties , all the questions of society , supported this .
in order to become part of the constitution , it has to be approved twice by congress .
on february 17th , it was approved for the second time with 114 to a voice .
immediately after this election , between the 21st and the 24th , february , a delegation of about 30 boelans were traveling to the two places that were most interested in the business of the city .
one place is south korea .
this is a picture of a large , new city city , which is built in southern korea , big than the city of the city .
everything you can see on this picture was built within four years after it took four years to get approved .
the other place that was very interested in cities is singapore .
there were two cities built in china , and the third is in preparation .
so if you think about it virtually , it &apos;s where we are today .
they already have a construction site ; they &apos;re already looking at this area for the second city .
it &apos;s been working on a legal system , that deprivation allows you to participate , and it &apos;s working on an external legal system .
a country has already offered to provide its supreme court , as a court for the disconcepent appeal of the world .
also urban designers and farmer are very interested .
they even get funding with one .
one thing you already know has been done , there &apos;s a lot of miwers .
there &apos;s a lot of businesses who would like to put themselves in america , especially at a place with a free-trade zone , and there are many people who would like to live there .
all around the world there are 700 million people who say they want to live permanent to another place .
a million people rely on latin america , and they go to the united states .
many of you are fathers who are forced to let back your families to work on work -- sometimes it &apos;s single mothers who have to earn enough money to eat food and clothes .
unfortunately , it &apos;s sometimes children who are trying to find their parents again that they have , in some cases , for a decade .
so what &apos;s the idea of trying to think about it in hong duras a whole new city ?
or is it even duzend of these cities , or hundreds of links around the world ?
so what is it for an idea to get every family to have a choice between multiple cities that are in competition in competition ?
this is an idea that &apos;s worth spreading .
my friends have asked me to say , thank you ted .
you know how many choices you do in a typical day ?
you know how many choices you meet in a typical week ?
i &apos;ve done a survey recently with over 2,000 americans , and the average number of choices that are dependent on a typical american is about 80 .
it was also done recently a study with ceos where they saw the ceo for a week .
and these scientists are just documenting the different themes that these ceos have been documenting with , and how much time they were making decisions with the issues .
and they found that an average ceo is working with 139 tasks week .
each of these themes , of course , was from many , many smaller decisions .
50 percent of their choices were made within nine minutes or less .
just about 12 percent of their choices took an hour or more of their time .
think about your own decisions .
you know how many choices you meet in the nine minutes of the subject in one hour ?
how good do you think they &apos;re the decisions to deal with ?
today , i want to talk about one of the biggest decision-making problems of our modern time , the decision-making problem .
i want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions .
now , if i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions , and i want to know your answers .
if i ask you a question , raise up , because i &apos;m blind , just when you want to burn some calories .
otherwise , i ask you , if i ask you a question , and your answer is yes , so my first question is , are you ready to hear something about the decision problem ?
thank you .
when i was a graduate student at stanford university , i went to this very exclusive life store ; at least he was really exclusive .
it was a store that was draeger .
this business , it was almost like a delight .
they had 250 different kinds of mustard and shelter and over 500 different kinds of fruit and vegetables and more than two dozen different kinds of water -- and that was a time when we actually drink water .
i loved going to this business , but at one point , i asked myself , well , how is it that you never buy something ?
here &apos;s the olive oil entrance .
they had all sorts of different varieties of olive oil , including those who were in boxes including a thousand years old .
so i decided one day to visit the branches , and i asked the chief , &quot; works this model , that they really offer all these possibilities ? &quot;
and he showed up on the bus charges of tourists that came every day and usually had their cameras .
we decided to do an experiment , and we chose marmelade for our experiment .
here &apos;s her marmelde gang .
they had 348 different kinds of marmelade .
we put a little bit of fears right on the entrance right now .
we put in six different ways of flavor of mormelade or 24 different directions , and we looked at two things : first , first of all , i would get more people standing , and marmelade try ?
it &apos;s more people standing when it was 24 percent , about 60 percent , when it was six , about 40 percent .
and after that we looked at the people who were more likely to buy a glass of mars .
now we saw the impact .
from the people who were standing as it was 24 , only three percent actually bought a glass of mars .
from the people who were standing when they were six , now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a glass of mars .
now , if you calculate it , people bought six times a glass of marmelade , who they had six to the choice when they had 24 to the selection .
now , not to buy a glass of marmelade is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our taille -- but it turns out that the decision overload is going to affect us with very big decisions .
we don &apos;t decide to decide even if it comes to our own best interests .
so , the theme of the day : funded saving .
now i &apos;m going to describe a study that i &apos;m going to do with gur huberman , eenica kamang , i did , where we were looking at the decisions for the retirement plans for almost a million americans in the entire united states .
and what we looked at was whether the number of people who were able to be able to do a pension plan that could affect the 401 plan , the probability of being saved for tomorrow .
and we found that there was a context in fact .
so in these plans , we had about 657 plans that gave people something between two to 59 .
and what we found was that the more fund was offered , that , in fact , was lower .
now , if you look at the extreme , the plans , the plans , the two fund , had a divided in the seventh -- still not as high as we want it .
in the plans , the almost 60 fund fund , the subdition now fell on the sixth percentage .
now it turns out that even if you &apos;re going to get to participate , if you were more options , even then , it has negative consequences .
so , the people who chose to participate in the way that the more possibilities were available to them , the more they were willing to choose and choose to vote .
the more opportunities they were available to , the more they put their money in pure water market .
none of these extreme decisions , to the decisions that someone would recommend , if you care about the future financial well-being .
now , in the last 10 years , we &apos;ve seen three essential negative consequences in humans that provide more and more choices .
they push the decision -- push them , even if it comes to their own best interest .
they &apos;re more likely to meet higher decisions -- worse resources and worse medical decisions .
they &apos;re more likely to decide to make things feel less happy , even if they make an objective better .
the main reason that we might enjoy this is that we might enjoy looking at these giant shelves of mayonaise , mustard , oil and marmelade , but we don &apos;t actually get the comparison and then choose something out of the fantastic supply .
so what i want to suggest today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we &apos;ve tested in different ways and different research places -- they can just apply them to their business .
first of all , limited .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never true as today that less .
people are always concerned when i say , &quot; limit . &quot;
they always worry that they lose the galapagos .
but in fact , we see it more and more and more and more and more that if you &apos;re willing to limit , and you &apos;re going to get rid of the unimportant possibilities , well , then there &apos;s a rise of sales , it &apos;s going to reduce the cost , the cost of decision-making .
and as a proctor and gamble , the different head of the different sleep and the pepper species of 26 reduction , they experienced a rise to 10 percent .
when the golden moumates sold her 10 at the worst , kattous was going to be sold , that the winning to go to 87 percent -- a result of sharing the rise of the sales and the cost of cost .
you know , the average supermacrates today gives you 45,000 products .
a typical wal-mart gives you 100,000 products today .
but the largest largest supermarket that is in the world today is aldi , and they only offer 1,400 products -- a kind of tomato sauce in doses .
now in the world of savings , i believe one of the best examples that have recently come on the market , about how to best be the choice of employees , was something that david laibm has designed very much , it &apos;s a program that is offered at harvard .
every single harvard employees now take place at a life-time fund .
those who really want to make a choice will be offered 20 fund , not 300 or more fund .
you know how people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to limit it .
it &apos;s all important opportunities . &quot;
and the first thing i &apos;m asking is , &quot; tell me how the possibilities are different from each other .
and if your employees can &apos;t keep them apart , they can &apos;t do it . &quot;
now before we started today , i had a conversation with gary .
and gary said that he would be willing to offer all the people in this audience , including the world &apos;s most beautiful holiday in the world .
here &apos;s a description of the road .
and i want to read you the one .
and now i &apos;m going to give you a couple of seconds to read them , and then i ask you to clap if you &apos;re willing to pick it up .
okay . everyone &apos;s ready to take a bite .
are they all ?
well , let me show you a little bit more about it .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
well , who &apos;s ready for this journey .
i think maybe i &apos;ve heard more hands .
good .
the fact is , you look at objective , the first time you had more information than the second time , but i would be a car that you &apos;ve found it in the second time .
because the images made it for them .
what brings me to the second technology is that it helps you deal with the problem of decision-making , it &apos;s the tangible .
it &apos;s about the fact that people , to understand the difference between opportunities , have to understand what consequences are associated with the single possibilities , and the consequences have to be beneficial and specific .
why are people in average 15 to 30 percent more if they use an ec-map or a credit card , when they &apos;re using cash ?
because it doesn &apos;t really feel money .
and it turns out that if you create something that feels specific , it &apos;s a very good tool to make people save more .
so we have done in a study that i &apos;ve done with shlomo benarro , alessandtero and alessandro , we &apos;ve made a study with the people who have been working for ring -- employees that have been working for ring -- and these people were all in one place in a meeting .
and as this gathering , we have this meeting just like you &apos;ve always been , and we &apos;ve added a small thing .
the small thing we added to it was that we asked people to think about all the positive things that would happen in their lives if they could save money .
in which we did this simple thing , there was a growing rise of participation to 20 percent and there was a rise of the number of people who were willing to save or a rise to four percent that they were willing to pay for the savings accounts .
third technology : categorization .
we can deal with more categories than more choices .
here &apos;s for example , a study that we did in a timeline .
it turns out it turns out to be supermarkets , and down in the northeast area , the number between 331 different kinds of magazines up to 664 magazines .
but you know what ?
if i show you 600 papers , and you put them in 10 categories , or i &apos;ll show you 400 magazines , and these in 20 categories , you think i &apos;ve given you more selection and a better experience than i &apos;ve given you 600 .
because the categories tell me how to keep them apart .
here are two different pieces of light .
one is called &quot; jazz , &quot; and the other is called &quot; tinkering . &quot;
if you think that the left display is a relational display , and the ad on jazz is , then you clap into the hands .
okay , there &apos;s a couple .
if you think that the one on the left is jazz , and you &apos;re on the right , you &apos;re clapping , please clap .
okay , some more .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
the one on the left is jazz and the right , but you know what ?
this is a highly sensitive categrement .
categories have to say something like that , not to provide the choice .
and this problem is often when you look at the long lists of all this fund .
who do you really want to express ?
my fourth technology : timing for complexity .
it turns out we can actually deal with more information than we think we need to simplify it .
we have to increase complexity .
i &apos;ll show you an example of what i mean .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : buy a car .
here &apos;s a clear car manufacturer that gives you the opportunity to disprove your car completely yourself .
you have to make 62 different choices to create your car completely .
now these decisions are different in the number of choices they offer a decision .
car colors , foreign color of the car -- i have 56 opportunities .
so , motors -- four ways .
now what i &apos;m doing is i change the order that comes to the decisions .
half of the customers are going to go from the many possibilities to the number , 56 car colors .
the other half of the customers go from the low possibilities , four of them , to the 56 car colors , many ways .
what do i look at ?
how interested you are .
if you used to use the standard choice in the decision , it means that you &apos;re going to overcare , that &apos;s the most powerful , i lose it .
what you find is that the people who are going to go from a lot of the chance to the number of choices are all over and over and over again .
we lose them .
go from the little choice to the many , then stay on it .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
the only thing i &apos;ve done is to change the sequence in that information .
if i start with the simple start , i &apos;m learning how to choose .
even though the motions choose , i don &apos;t say anything about my own preferences in the equipment , it still makes me choose .
it also brings me into excitement about the big product that i put together , and so i &apos;m willing to get ready to be with interest .
let me summarize .
i &apos;ve told you about four techniques , the problem of decision-making superstation -- limited -- you &apos;ll get rid of the liquid alternatives ; you &apos;re going to make it real ; categorize it -- we can do better with more categories , less opportunities .
each of these techniques that i &apos;m going to describe today is to help you to manage the possibilities -- good for you , you can use them for yourself , good for people who offer service .
because i think the key to the best choice is that you &apos;re voting with choice .
and the more we choose to choose , the better we will be able to practice the art of choice .
thank you .
hi . i &apos;m kevin allocca , trends manager on youtube . i &apos;m looking at youtube videos .
that &apos;s true .
today we want to talk about how videos are viral , and then why is that important at all .
we all want to be stars -- celebrities , singers , itunes -- when i was young , that was so powerful .
but web videos have allowed us to be able to get rid of all of our creative activities , in a part of the culture of our world .
every single one of you could be on the internet until next saturday .
but in youtube , more than 48 hours of video are uploaded to a minute .
again , it &apos;s going to be a tiny percentage , and it &apos;s ever going to look at thousands and thousands of times .
so how does this work ?
three things : tastemaker , subpity communities and the unexpected .
well , then we want .
oh my god . oh my god .
oh my god !
woah !
whohhhh , wowwww !
last year , vasvasiled , this video he photographed before his house in yosemite national park .
in 2010 , it was 23 million times .
this chart shows how it looked like the video was popular for the first time .
it really didn &apos;t want to make a virus video .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
because you do this as you do yosemite mountain .
he had a lot of natural videos .
and this video was actually been sent in january .
what &apos;s happening here ?
there was jimmy kimmel .
jimmy kimmel senged the tweet that made the video so popular .
because tastemaker like jimmy can represent us new and interesting things , and show you a big audience .
it &apos;s friday , friday . get get down on friday on friday . you can reach the investor to the investor , clone , friday , friday .
rs : one of the most popular videos of the year .
it was looked at almost 200 million times this year .
so the graphics looked like this .
just like &quot; double rainbow , &quot; it seems to be out of nowhere .
what happened in this day ?
well , it was friday , right ?
if you want to know , these other peaks are also free .
but what about this day , that particular friday ?
now , tosh.0 fori , a lot of blogs started writing about it .
michael j. nelson from the pr science theater was a first one that made a joke for twitter .
and what &apos;s important is that a single person or a group of tastemaker took a point of view , with a big audience , and so on .
and then this community was formed people who shared this big deadline , and they started to play around and playing it around .
now there are 10,000 dilemmas of &quot; friday &quot; in youtube .
already in the first seven days , there was a memorial for every single week .
unlike the 20th century entertainment of the 20th century , participation is our way of becoming part of this phenomenon -- either by spreading it , or something new .
&quot; nyan cat &quot; is animation and music in endless loop .
that &apos;s it , very simple .
this year was looked at almost 50 million times .
and if you think that &apos;s crazy , you should know that there &apos;s a three-mile version that has been looked at four million times .
even cats look at this video .
cats look at cats who look at this video .
what &apos;s important is that creativity , which is in the internet culture of techies and geeks .
there were remixes .
somebody made an old-fashioned version of it .
and then it became international .
a whole recox community shot out of the ground that made it funny to something that we can all participate in .
now we don &apos;t just find pleasure on something , we do .
who could have been looking at this ?
who would be able to predict &quot; double rainbow &quot; or rebecca black or &quot; nyan cat ? &quot;
what are the books that you can write about , which is this ?
in a world where every minute is uploaded to two days , two days of video , it can be really unique and unexpected .
i &apos;m not interested in it , i was not very interested in a friend , i said , i should look at this great video , about a guy who protested in new york for driving cycles .
i got a ticket , because i &apos;m not going to go on on the plane , but often there &apos;s challenges that don &apos;t let you go on the hill .
so this is completely surprising and humorous , a casey nifish &apos;s funny idea , and his argument was at 5 million times .
this approach is true for all new , which we do .
and that all leads us to a big question ...
what does that mean ?
whohhh .
what does that mean ?
tastemaker , creative community communities , totally unexpected , are the characteristics of a new media type of media and culture that everyone has defined , and in the audience popular .
as i said , one of the biggest stars -- justin bieber -- made his early youtube .
no one has to give your ideas green .
and today we &apos;re all feeling as owners of our pop culture .
and these are not the characteristics of the old media and they hardly meet the media of today , but they will determine the conversation of the future .
thank you .
how can i talk about the interconnectedness between women about three generations , and how the amazing strength of these interconnectedness in the lives of a four-year girl manifest , when they were sitting in front of 30 years ago with their little sister , their mother and their grandmother five days before they speak today ?
the story is not over .
it &apos;s a puzzle that will be put together .
i want to tell you about some of the puzzle bits .
imagine the first piece : a man that burns his life .
he &apos;s a poet , a writer , a man whose whole life of the simple hope of unity and freedom of his home .
think of it in the 1940s of the communist in saigon , as he has to stand , that his life was a single waste .
the words , as long as his friends , screted his .
he moved back to silence .
he died , broken through history .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i never met him personally .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
my grandmother never forget his life .
i had to make it not for free , and it was my job to learn that the story was really trying to beat us , but we were overstanding .
the next puzzle part shows how a boat is quiet in the early morgenred of lake .
my mother may have been 18 when her father died -- in an arranged marriage , with two little girls .
for them , their lives had a job : the escape of their family and a new life in australia .
it was completely disconnected that it could fail .
after a four-year-old and movie saga soga , a boat silent on the lake as fishing .
all adults were aware of the risks .
they had the biggest fear of pirates , rape and death .
like most adults on the boat , my mother was wearing a little toxic bottle .
one of my sister would have only had my sister and i , then you and my grandmother .
my first memories are from this boat -- the steady tucker of the engine , the clapping of a single wave on the bug , the vast and blank horizon .
i don &apos;t remember the pirates that came up with many times , but from the death of men on our boat , let &apos;s say , or in the case of the engine , the six hours didn &apos;t want to start .
but i remember the lights of the oil platform before the malaysia coast , and the young man who broke together and died , the end of the journey was too much for him , and on the taste of the first aprock , i gave one of the men on the platform .
no apple ever looked like this again .
after three months in a refugee camp , we landed in melbourne .
and the next puzzle piece is about four of women in three generations that together build a new life .
we had to let ourselves down in football , one from the class class , which is the population of immigrants .
in other words , in the middle of the middle class , their existence was completely unknown to me , there was no more sophisticated thinking .
the smell from the laads came from the rest of the world .
and the fat broken english has been spread between people who had one thing in common : they started fresh .
my mother worked on farms , then on a treadmill in a car factory , six days , twice .
you kind of managed to find the time to have english and acmentcations .
we were poor .
every dollar was divided , and it was put in another education for english and mathematics , no matter what we had to do for this . mostly , the new things were coming out of the second hand .
two panels for school , each , to cover the holes in the other .
a school uniform to the buttons , because she had to pass six years .
and there were the rare ones that were painful of &quot; bad eye &quot; and here and there , and there , &quot; asians , go home . &quot;
home where ?
something kept in me .
there was a meeting for reconciliation and quiet voice said , &quot; i &apos;m going to go out of the way . &quot;
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
my mother was exhausted every night , but we told each other about our day , and we heard the movement of our grandmother in the house .
my mother suffered dreaming from the boat .
and it was my job to stay awake every night until her nightmare came , so i could make them .
they opened a computer business , then they made a cosgue , and they opened a company .
and the women came with their stories about men who didn &apos;t have change , angry and unflexible , and well-filled kids in between two worlds .
loans and sponsors were searching .
centers were built up .
i lived in parallel worlds .
in one case , i was the classic asian student , the unbitting demands of himself .
in the other hand , i was involved in uncertain life that wore the tragic scars of violence , the drug abuse and the insulation .
but so many got over the years .
and because of this aid , i went out in my last year of judaism as a young semester of the year .
and i was introduced by a puzzle piece to the next katapuli , and the edges of the fit were not together .
tan le , anonymous sparber from football , was now tan le , refugee and social activist , who was invited to talk to places that they never heard of , and in homes , they could never have imagined .
i was not familiar with the labels .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the bribe .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i wanted to go back to the routine and the comfort of life of an unknown preference -- a grandmother and two daughters , a mother and two daughters who were doing it every day for 20 years by telling each other of their day , and we were still sleeping in the same bed .
i said my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
she reminded me that i was as old as she left , when we went to the boat .
no one was never a way .
&quot; just do it , &quot; she said . &quot; and not what you &apos;re not . &quot;
so i talked about jugenesis and education , and the disproportionation of the marginalized and disformed .
and the more open i spoke , the more i should tell .
i met people in all sorts of places , so many of them did what they loved , they lived in the limits of possible .
and even though i had my degree , i realized that i couldn &apos;t find myself in law a career .
there had to be another puzzle piece .
and i realized , at the same time , that it &apos;s okay to be an underdog , to be new in the image -- and not just okay , but something you need to be grateful , maybe a gift of the boat .
because in dazuins so easily , the horizontal can lead to collapse so easily that you can accept the assumptions of the environment .
i &apos;ve now gone out of my convenience to know that , yes , the world disappears , but not as you fear it .
possibilities that were not allowed would have been very distorted .
there was a energy , an incomplete optimism , a strange mix of humility and faith .
so i followed my gut feeling .
i collected a little team of people around me for the high school , which is not an unfair challenge .
we didn &apos;t have a year for a year .
at the end of one day , i was a huge floating soup that we shared .
we worked late to the night .
most of our ideas were crazy , but it was a few brilliant , and we created the breakthrough .
i met the decision to pull in the u.s.
after just a trip there .
my gut feeling again .
three months later , i was moved , and the adventure went on .
before i finish the talk , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up in a time where the social norm and the local prisoners was the most important person .
life had not changed for centuries .
her father died soon after her birth .
her mother did it alone .
with 17 , she became the second woman of a sabbatical whose mother suggested her .
without the support of her husband , she worried for a great deal by bringing him to court , and she was in her own case , and a more significant task than she won .
&quot; don &apos;t hit it . &quot;
i just duked in a hotel room in sydney when she died . 1,000 miles away in melbourne .
i looked through the shock wall and saw it on the other side .
i knew she was coming to say goodbye .
my mother called me a few minutes after that .
a few days later , we went into a buddhist temple in football and sat around her sarg .
we told her stories and insurance that we were still in her .
and by midnight , the monk and he said he had to close the sarg .
my mother asked us to grab her hand .
she asked the monk , &quot; why is your hand so warm and the rest of your hand so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because she has been holding it tomorrow , &quot; he said .
&quot; they didn &apos;t leave them . &quot;
if there &apos;s a band in our family , it &apos;s through the women .
you see who we were and how life has shaped us , we can now see that the men who might be in our lives would have come to us .
the defeat would have been too simple .
now i &apos;d like to have my own kids , and i think of the boat .
who would ever have a wish ?
yes , i &apos;m afraid i was afraid of privilege , suffering .
can i give you a bug in your life in your life , the courageous wave of every wave , unspeaked , stesty tucker of the engine , which doesn &apos;t guarantee anything ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give this , and i could make it clear , i would do it .
the mother is here today in the fourth or fifth row .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
is it even photography ?
because , of course , this is a picture you can &apos;t take with your camera .
yet , my interest in photography , when i got my first digital camera , at age 15 .
i combined it with my earlier introduction of drawing , but it was a little different , because using the camera was actually the process in planning .
and if you put a picture with a camera with a camera , the process ends when you press it .
so for me , it seemed to be more like photography to be the right place at the right time .
i believed anybody could .
so i wanted to create something else , something where the process is going to begin .
photographs like this : a building along a much lower road .
but it has an unexpected twist .
and yet , it &apos;s a realistic level .
or photographs like this -- dark and colorful at the same time , but everyone with the shared goal to keep a realistic level .
when i say reality , i mean photoreality .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can really capture , but i want to let it look like you could have , on a photograph .
photos where you have to think a short moment to figure out the trick .
so it &apos;s more likely to capture an idea than really a moment .
but what is the trick that makes it realistic ?
is it about the details or the colors ?
is it about the light ?
what creates the illusion ?
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
but ultimately , it &apos;s about how we interpret the world , and how it can be done on a two-dimensional surface .
it &apos;s not about what is realistic , but what we think is realistic .
so i think the basics are very simple .
i see them as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces and put it together to create an alternative reality .
and let me show you a simple example .
we have three perfect physical objects that we can all identify with in a three-dimensional world .
but in a certain way , you can create something that is still three-dimensional , as if it could exist .
but at the same time we know that that &apos;s not possible .
so we overlist our brains because our brains are not really making sense of it .
and i see the same process in combining photographs .
it &apos;s really just about combining different realities .
so the things that make a picture of realistic , i think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t think about around us , the things around us .
but if we combine photographs , it &apos;s really important to think about it , because you just look kind of wrong .
so i would say there are three simple rules to follow a realistic outcome .
as you can see , it &apos;s not three special images .
but you can combine something special like this .
so the first rule is combined photos should have the same perspective .
secondly , put together photographs of the same light .
and these two pictures have to fulfill these two demands -- from the same altitude , and the same light .
third , it &apos;s about making it impossible to make it possible where the individual images begin and end up by connecting them underwater .
makes it impossible to say how the photo was actually put together .
so by adding color , contrast and helliity on the edges of the individual images , and photographic men , in the field of field , are mapped by fish , like spatial , discharged colors and disorders , we can basically take the boundaries between the different images , even though a picture can basically contain hundreds of levels .
here &apos;s another example .
you might think that this is just a country &apos;s picture , and the bottom part has been manipulated .
but this picture is actually completely composed of photographs of different places .
i personally think it &apos;s easier to create a place when you find a place , because you don &apos;t have to have a compromise with the ideas in your head .
but it requires a lot of planning .
and when i had this idea in the winter , i knew that i needed several months to plan them to find different places for the pieces of the puzzle .
for example , the fish had been taken on a treadmill .
the bank comes from a different place .
the underwater part comes from a rock .
and yes , i even put the house up on the island of red to let it look .
so to get a realistic outcome , it goes from me to planning .
i always start with a cartoon , an idea .
after that , it &apos;s the combination of different images .
and here &apos;s a very good job .
and if you make good pictures , the result can be pretty beautiful , and also pretty realistic .
so there are all the tools there , and the only thing that we do is we have our imagination .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to talk to you about why so many electronic health projects failed .
and i think the most important point is that we stopped talking to our patients .
and one of the things that we introduced in the manra university was to take a major audience .
it &apos;s not particularly scientific -- it &apos;s a cup of coffee or tea , and asks the patients , families , relatives , &quot; how is it ?
how can we help you ? &quot;
and we think we want to think that this is one of the main problems , why all of them -- maybe most of the electronic health projects fail , because we stopped listening .
this is my wlan-waage . a very simple thing .
it &apos;s got a button , it &apos;s out .
and every morning i wake up .
and yes , i have a job as you might recognize .
i put my job on 95 pounds .
it works very simply : every time i leave on the floor , you send my data to google health .
and you &apos;ll also be called from my general doctor so that he can see where my weight problem is , and it &apos;s not just in the moment that i need kardigic support or something , but also in the past .
but there &apos;s something else .
maybe you &apos;re familiar with this , i &apos;ve got over 4,000 commandments who are on twitter .
so every morning i run on my wlan-white age , and people talk to me before i sit in the car , &quot; lunch just a little salad today , lucien . &quot;
but this is the most net , what can happen , because this is the group pressure , group pressure , to help patients , because that could be used against obesity , or it could be used by patients .
but it could also be used to get people out of their chairs , and they &apos;re trying to play some kind of game to control their health better .
next week , this comes on the market .
it &apos;s going to give you a little blood pressure device that you put on an iphone or something like that .
and it will allow people to measure their blood pressure from home , sending it to their doctor and share it for more than 100 dollars .
at this point , the patients come into play . they can &apos;t just take control of the control , the captain on their own ship , but can also help us be in health care with the challenges that are before us , and the cost of healthcare , twice , and so on .
make ways that are easy to use and start to hug them with that , patients in the team .
and you can do that through these kinds of techniques , but also crowdsource .
and one of the things we did , i want to share with you through a short video .
we all have navigational systems in our cars .
maybe even in our cell phones .
we know exactly where all of the money ms are around maastrids .
we know one more where all the gas stations are .
and sure , we can find fast food chains .
but where would the next aed to help this patient ?
we wondered , and nobody knew it .
no one knew where the next life rescue was in this moment .
so , what did we do ? we did crowdsource in the netherlands .
we built a website , and a human mass asked , &quot; if you see an omed , please share with us where he is , when he &apos;s closed , &quot; because sometimes he &apos;s closed during business times , of course .
and over 10,000 , over 10,000 have been released in the netherlands .
the next step was to find the apps for this .
and we created an ipad app .
we &apos;ve developed an app for layar , integrated reality to find these aeds .
and if you &apos;re in a city like maastrique , and someone collapses , you can use your iphone , and within the next few weeks , you can use microclinical phones to try and find life .
and today , we don &apos;t just want to do this as aed4u , as the product is called , but also introduce as an aed4us .
and we want to put this on a global scale .
and we ask our colleagues all over the world , from other universities , to help us behave like kacting points , to crowdsource these aeds around the world .
and if you &apos;re in vacation , and someone collapses , it &apos;s your own relatives or somebody else , you can find such an aed .
the other thing we want to ask is that companies all over the world are helping us with this ayn .
for example , that could be fun , or technicians , just to make sure that the previous one is still in its place .
please help us and try and improve the health of the health , but to take the hand .
thank you .
today i &apos;m going to report from unexpected discoveries .
i work in the solar system .
and my little startup wants us to force ourselves by ...
... it makes it clear .
here &apos;s a quick video about what we do .
oh . a moment .
it might take you until it &apos;s downloaded .
now -- we can just skip this -- i &apos;m going to skip the video instead .
no .
that &apos;s not ...
okay .
solar technology is ...
oh , my time is over ?
okay . thank you .
so a few years ago , i &apos;ve started a program to get the stars in technology and design to take a year back and work in an environment that &apos;s pretty much everything you actually hate .
the program is called &quot; code for america , &quot; and it &apos;s a little bit like the peace set for computer geeks .
we &apos;re choosing a few fellows every year and we &apos;re going to let them work with neighborhoods .
instead of sending them to the third world , we send them into rathents .
and they developed great apps , working with urban workers .
but what they really do is show what &apos;s possible today with technology .
so they meet al .
al is a hydrant in boston .
here it looks like he &apos;s looking for a date , but what he really looks like is someone who opens him up , if he &apos;s at the time , because he knows he &apos;s not very good in the branding when he &apos;s covered by a meter of a foot .
how did he get to look for this particular kind of help ?
we had a team of fellows in boston in the last year , the code for america .
they were there in february , and it &apos;s been a lot of time last february .
and they realized that the city never dripped these fires .
but a particular fellow , a man named erik drake eler obhe , he noticed something else , and that was that the united states is free for the civil walks .
so he did what every good developers would do , he wrote an app .
it &apos;s a nice little app where you can exploit a hydrant .
you agree to keep it free if it hits it .
if you do that , you can give him a name , and he called the first al .
if you don &apos;t do that , somebody can take it away .
so there &apos;s a nice little game dynamic .
this is a modest little app .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of the 21 apps that fellows have written last year .
but it does something that doesn &apos;t do any other government technology .
they &apos;re spreading out .
there &apos;s this guy in the i.t. department of the city of hong olulu , who has seen that he could use these app , not for snow , but , to the citizens of the citizens .
it &apos;s very important that these tsunami work , but people steal the batteries .
so he got the citizen to check .
and then seattle decided to use the app to get the citizens to clean the hairs .
and chicago has just introduced them to open the budge up when it hits it .
we now know nine cities that are planning to use these app .
and it &apos;s unregulated , organic , of course .
if you know something about government technology , you know it &apos;s usually not going to happen .
the power of software takes a few years to rule .
we had a team that worked last year on a project in boston for three people , two and a half months .
it was about a way to find out the parents who are the right public schools for their children .
we got told later that if it was going to go over the normal channels , it took over two years , and it would have taken over two million dollars .
and that &apos;s nothing else .
there &apos;s a project in california right now in california , which has cost the tax for two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this on every level of government .
so an app , which is written in a few days , and then comes out of seluned , is a kind of shot of the bug on the institution of the government .
it shows how the government could work better -- no more like a private company , how many people think they should .
and not even like a tech company , but rather like the internet itself .
and that means free access , which means open and productive .
and that &apos;s important .
but more importantly , this app is that they represent a new generation , which is the problem of government -- not as the problem of scarcity , but as a problem of collective trade .
and this is a very good news , because it turns out we &apos;re very well in collective action with digital technology .
now there &apos;s a big community of people making the tools that we need to put things effectively together .
it &apos;s not just &quot; code for america &quot; fellows , there are hundreds of people all over the country that write up and write government apps every day in their own communities .
they don &apos;t give up the government .
they &apos;re terribly frustrated with their , but they don &apos;t complain about it , they fix it .
and these people know something we lost from the eyes .
and that &apos;s when you all forget about politics and the queue of labor , and all the other things that we really forget about is the government that we really get excited about is government , in the core of tim o &apos;splly , &quot; what we can do in common . &quot;
now , a lot of people have given up the government .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , i want you to think about it , because things are changing .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; government is in change .
and because the government eventually gives their power out of us -- remember , &quot; we the people ? &quot; -- how we think about it , will affect how this change happens .
i didn &apos;t know much about government when i started this program .
and as many people , i thought it was mainly about choosing people in a office .
now after two years , i &apos;ve come to the conclusion that it &apos;s mostly in communities to go to the thylacine .
this is the call center for service and information .
you usually come out when you &apos;re in your town 311 .
if you &apos;ve ever got the chance to work in your urban call center , like our fellow scott silentman as part of the program -- in fact , you &apos;re going to do it all -- you &apos;re going to see that people who are calling the government for many different problems , including , in their house .
scott is getting this headass .
he &apos;s &quot; thylacine &quot; in the official database .
and he didn &apos;t really have an idea . he begins with the animal cattz .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , can you just open all the doors in your house and play very loud music , and see if the livestock is abesting ? &quot;
and that worked . hand for scott .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the thylacine .
it wasn &apos;t just a call center .
it has an app , a web- and manual app , called &quot; regulation . &quot;
we didn &apos;t write this app .
this is a lot of work people in the office of the new urban catalog in boston .
one day -- this is an actual report -- came in in my trash , and i can &apos;t say if she &apos;s dead .
how do i get them away ? &quot;
but what happens was different .
scott underended himself from human beings .
but on &quot; regulation &quot; is all public , so everyone can see it .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
and the next post that we got was , &quot; i went over there , the garbage was behind the house .
thylacine ? yes . alive ? yap .
turned the trash on the page . went home .
good night , sweet thylacine . &quot;
pretty simple .
this is great . here &apos;s the digital thing .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how the government is getting into crowdscale .
but it &apos;s also a great example of the government as a platform .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition of the platform .
i &apos;m more likely to talk about a platform for people to help themselves and help others .
a citizen helped another citizen , but the government played a central role here .
they communicate these two people .
and you could have been able to connect them with government services if they had been needed , but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative to government services .
if a neighbor helps the other , we exploit our communities .
let &apos;s call it the animal , it costs a lot of money .
one of the most important things is we need to think that government is not the same as politics .
and most people understand what they believe is the input of the other .
that our contribution to the system is to vote .
how often do we have elected a political leader -- and sometimes we &apos;ve used a lot of energy to choose a new political leader -- and then we get back and we expect , and we expect the government , and then not much changed ?
this is because the government is like a further ocean , and politics is the top 15th .
and what &apos;s underneath is what we call bureaucracy .
and we use this word with such a contempch .
but it &apos;s this contempt that we own , that we pay for , and we pay to be something that works against us , something else , and then we made ourselves .
people seem to think politics is sexy .
if we want these institution to work , we have to make bureaucracy sexy .
because that &apos;s where the government works .
we need to take a government of the government .
so the debt movement has done it .
did you see these guys ?
it &apos;s a group of concern , which has written a very detailed 325 glider report , which is an answer on the sec memo to financial reform .
it &apos;s not politically active to be active .
now , for those of us who have given up the government , it &apos;s time that we think about the world that we want to leave our children .
you have to think of the enormous challenges that you have to imagine .
do we really think we need to achieve what we need to do without improving the institution that can act in the name of us all ?
a government is absolutely necessary , but it has to become more efficient .
the good news is that technology makes it possible to change the function of government in a way that can actually achieve something by empowering society .
and there &apos;s a generation that &apos;s grown up with the internet , and the white knows that it &apos;s not so hard to do things together , you have to build it properly .
now the average age of our fellows is 28 , so i &apos;m , unfortunately , almost a generation older than most of you .
this is a generation that grew up with their voice as granted of granted .
they &apos;re not fighting this struggle that we &apos;re all going to fight , therefore , who can talk to them .
you can make your opinion , to every channel at any time , and you can do it .
so , if you &apos;re faced with the problem of government , you don &apos;t care so much about using your voices .
they use their hands .
they use their hands to write applications that improve the work of government .
and these apps allow us to use our hands to improve our communities .
it could be free to open a hydrant , uncured , to put a vendor with a thylacine .
and sure , we would have these hydrant fires all the time , and many people do that .
but these apps are like small digital memories that we &apos;re not only consumers , and we &apos;re not only consumers who pay taxes and sustain taxes .
we &apos;re more than that , we &apos;re citizens .
and we &apos;re not going to improve government until we improve the federal citizenship .
so the question i have for you all here : if it comes to the big , important things that we have to do together , all together , will we just be a lot of voices , or will we be a lot of hands ?
thank you .
and usually , my role is to explain the people how wonderful the new technologies are coming up , and i thought , because i &apos;m here among friends , i would tell you what i really think is going to happen .
i &apos;m going to start by showing you a single , boring slide .
if you could just show the slide .
this is a slide i &apos;ve chosen from my folder .
it &apos;s not about the details of the slide , but rather , the general form .
this slide shows you data from a analysis of risk processors compared to the performance of a local area networks .
the interesting thing here is that this slide , like so many others , which we often meet in our field , is a sort of a semi-logarithmic curve .
in other words , every step here is a force in the performance scale .
and this is a new body that we have to use this guy scale on semi-logarithmic curves in technology .
something very strange happens here .
this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about .
so , if you could make the light again again .
something else , because i &apos;m going to draw something on the paper here .
now , why do we draw graphs in technology on semi-logarithmic curves ?
the reason for this is if i would draw it on a regular curve , where , say , this is the years of a kind of time , so the time of a kind of technology , and this is a continuous scale of technology that i want to share with you , then the graph becomes silly .
you look like this .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us a lot .
now , if i want to record a different technology , let &apos;s say a transportation technology , then it would come very unreasonable , in a flat line .
but if something like this happens , it changes the quality of life .
so if the transportation technology would continue as fast as the microprocessor technology would move , then we could get over to a taxi and would be in 30 seconds in tokyo .
but that &apos;s not so fast .
we &apos;ve never had this before in the history of technology development , this kind of recursive growth , through which the scale all of us are growing exponentially .
the question i want to ask you is , if you look at this exponential curves , you don &apos;t see it forever .
it &apos;s not possible that everything forever and forever evolved as fast as it is .
there are two ways .
either it &apos;s going to be a classic curve like this , or something completely new , or it will happen here .
it &apos;s about it .
well , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think something like this is going to happen .
it &apos;s really that , then it means we &apos;re in the middle of a transition right now .
we &apos;re here on this line , in a transition of the world has a new kind of world .
so the question i &apos;d like to ask , and i also often want to ask myself , is this new world ?
what is this new state that keeps the world slowly ?
because the transition seems very , very confusing to be in the middle of it .
when i was a kid , there was the future somewhere in 2000 and people talked about what would happen in the year 2000 .
now we have a conference where people talk about the future , and you realize that the future is still in 2000 .
we don &apos;t keep going .
so in other words , the future of every year has passed over a year since i &apos;m on this world .
i think the reason is that we realize something is happening .
the transition happens . we can all feel it .
and we know that it doesn &apos;t make any sense to try to look at 30 or 50 years into the future , because everything is going to be so different that there &apos;s a very simple calculation of what we &apos;re doing now .
so i want to talk about what this might be , this transition in which we are right now .
to make this happen , i &apos;m going to first talk about some other things that really don &apos;t have to do with technology or computers .
because i really think to understand this , we have to go back and look at the thing on a longer scale scale .
and that &apos;s what i want to look at on time scale of the earth .
i think the whole picture makes sense when you split it in a few billion steps .
so let &apos;s go back , and it &apos;s 2.5 billion years . the earth was a big , more prolilized blade of chemicals .
now , if you look at the way these chemicals were organized , then there &apos;s a pretty good picture about how they did it .
i also think there &apos;s theories that start to understand how it started with rna , but i &apos;m going to tell you a simplified story about what &apos;s happening at this time , that there are little oil drocks around the chemicals .
now , some of these oil drocks developed a particular combination of chemicals which allowed them to integrate chemicals from outside and to grow .
all those were so , started sharing .
these little oil drocks were the most primitive cell form .
but these oil drocks weren &apos;t about living in the other sense , because every single one of them was just a small , random recipe of chemicals .
and every time it divided , it has spread the chemicals in it .
so every drip was a little different .
in fact , the dropbacks , which had an asset for growth , more powerful than others and integrated more and more chemicals from outside and divided .
so these biases tend to survive longer , and they increased into scale .
so this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but more interesting it will be , if these drip drops learned a trick about abstraction .
in a way that we don &apos;t quite understand yet , these drip will learn the ability to cover information .
they &apos;ve learned to store the recipe of the cell as information , and in a particular chemical form that we call dna .
in other words , you &apos;ve found in this intellectual way , an evolutionary way that allowed you to write out what they were doing , so that this information could be stored and copied .
the amazing thing about this is that this kind of information to store about the time of 2.5 billion years in which they were born .
in fact , the recipe for us , which is our genes , from exactly the same code and the same writing .
and every being uses exactly the same letters and the same code .
we are as though we can write only to the purpose of it , even in this code .
and i have 100 micrograms here , which i &apos;m trying to keep in airports from security gloves .
there &apos;s -- what i &apos;ve done is i &apos;ve taken this code -- the code is made of normal letters that we use to use -- and i wrote my business card on a piece of dna , and i wrote it 10 ^ 22 times .
so if someone wants a hundred million copies of my business card , i have enough for everybody in this room and even for anyone in this room , and it &apos;s right here .
if i was in fact a egoist , i would have written it on a virus and put it into the room .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
the copenhagen of the dna was an interesting step .
and that gave these cells -- that made them happy for another billion years .
but then another thing happened , very interesting step , where things were completely different , which is that these cells began to communicate and share information , so communities were born .
i don &apos;t know if they knew that , but bacteria can actually replace their dna .
this is the reason why it grows to antibiotics .
some bacteria have found how you can think of penicillin and have written this information together with other bacteria into the dna and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin because the bacteria communicate .
now this communication allowed for some of the reasons that were in a certain sense of the same boat ; they were synertic .
so they either survived , or they went together , and that meant that if a community was successful , all the individuals of the community were repeated more and more .
now , this is where these communities are so close together , that they decided to write the recipe for the whole community in a sign chain on the dna .
and the next interesting phase took about a billion years .
at this point , we have more poral communities , communities of many changes of cell activity , which together as individual organism .
in fact , we &apos;re also such a bit of a virtual community .
we have a lot of cells that are not put on themselves .
your skin cells are useless without heart cells , muscle cells , brain cells and so on .
so these communities began to evolve , so that the level , on which evolution was happening , not the single cell , but the entire cell community , which we call organism .
the next step happened within this community .
the cell communities began to abstract information again .
and they developed special structures which didn &apos;t do anything else than information within the organism .
and these are the neural structures .
so the neurons are the information processing of information that these cell communities have built .
they started to train specialists within the community , special structures , which were responsible for learning , understanding information .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
this gave them an evolutionary advantage .
because at this point , an individual -- learning has happened within the time of a single organism , rather than about this evolutionary period of time .
so an organism could learn , for example , a certain kind of fruession , because she didn &apos;t want to eat bad and made it sick , the last time he ate it .
now , this could happen within a single organism , whereas hundreds of thousands of years ago , because this information had to be taken by the individuals who died because of this fruitment , because they were not there .
so the nervous process has the evolutionary process of this particular information , because the evolution could now live within an individual .
it could happen within a period of time learning .
what happened after that is that the individual organisms found a way to communicate with each other .
as an example , the most subtle we know of this communication form is human language .
it &apos;s a pretty amazing invention when you think about it .
i have a very complicated , unreasonable and confused idea in my head .
i &apos;m sitting here , and i &apos;m just sitting in the case of my hope to create a kind of confused idea in your head that has a certain resemge with my original idea .
so we &apos;re taking something very complicated , it &apos;s going to turn it into sound , a sequence of sound , and produce something very complicated in the head of others .
so this allows us to work again as a unified organism .
and what we actually did , we , the humanity , is we started to abstract .
we &apos;re going through the same stages , which have made more cellular organisms -- the abstraction of our methods , how we capture data , we process it .
for example , the invention of language was a little step in this direction .
telephone , computer , video , cd-roms , and so on , are all our specialized mechanisms that we built in our community to have this information .
and it connects us all together to something that is much bigger , and also able to move faster than we &apos;ve been .
so today evolution can happen in time by microseconds .
you &apos;ve also seen a little bit of evolutionary example where he showed a bit of evolution in the convolzy program , right before your eyes .
so we have the timeline again again .
the first steps of history , which i told you , was a billion years per year .
the next steps , like the nervous system , and the brain , a few hundred million years .
then the dawn , as language and so forth , would have fewer than a million years .
and these next steps , like electronics , only few decades to take .
the process is feeding itself from itself , and so i think car catalytic is the word for it -- if something changes its change .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
and i think that &apos;s what we see here in this exploding curve .
we see the process that feeds itself from itself .
i live a living from the building of computers and i know that i &apos;m using the mechanism that i &apos;m using to build computers , not using the recent progress in computer technology .
my current activity is to design objects with such high complexity that it &apos;s impossible to design this in the traditional sense .
i don &apos;t know what every single transistor is doing in the commitment machine .
it has billions of them .
what i do instead , and what the designers of thinking are doing is we think of a certain abstract level , which is the machine and the machine makes it something that goes far beyond our capabilities , better and faster than we could ever do .
and it makes it part of what we don &apos;t even understand right now .
one way , which is particularly interesting , and what i &apos;ve used most recently is the evolution itself .
we put an evolutionary process in the machine , which is happening in the microwave area .
in order to call an example , in the most extreme cases , we can create a program which evolved from random inexction instructions .
we say , &quot; computers , generated a hundred million random sequences of inexction sequences .
now , you &apos;re all going to run these randomly elected instructions , take all the programs out of it , and pick the people who are the next . &quot;
so , in other words , i first define what i want .
let &apos;s say , i want numbers , that would be a simple example that i &apos;ve used for it .
so find programs that can tap on the former numbers .
of course , the opportunity with random suppstructed instructions is very small , that it &apos;s a number of visible numbers , so you &apos;re probably not going to do that .
but one of those people who might be lucky about the right order of backs .
now i say , &quot; computers , take the 10 percent of the sequences that i &apos;ve come up with the next .
it goes down , it waats the rest .
now , reproducting all the remaining ones that have the numbers .
and with a method of reforming , analog to reproduction . &quot;
take two programs and produce kids through the exchange of their subroutines , and the kids are making the characteristics of the subroutines of the two programs .
so now i have a new generation of programs that came through combinations of programs , which came up with a little bit closer than others .
tell , &quot; please repeat this process . &quot;
do it again .
run some mutations .
and try again with another generation .
all these generations need a few milliseconds .
and so i can go through an evolution over millions of years in the computer , or in more complex cases , some hours .
finally , i get programs that can make numbers perfect .
in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i could ever write from hand .
when i look at these programs , i can &apos;t say how they work .
i tried to understand them .
it &apos;s seductive and strange programs .
but they do the job .
i know and i &apos;m sure that they do the job , because they come from a series of 100,000 programs that have done the job .
because your life depended on whether you did the job right .
i sat down once in a 747 with marvin minsky , and he set up a map and says , &quot; oh look . look at that .
it says , &quot; is this airplane made out of tens of smaller parts that are working together to make their flight safer . &quot;
we know that a development process is not optimal when it becomes too complicated .
so we &apos;re starting to rely on computers for a process , which is very different from classical engineering .
he allows us to do things with a much higher complexity than it would allow us to produce .
and yet we don &apos;t understand the possibilities yet .
so , in reality , technology overcuts us .
we now use these programs to make the computer much faster , so that we can do these processes even faster .
so it creates feedback feedback .
it gets faster and faster and faster , and i think that &apos;s why it seems to be so confusing .
because all these new technologies of today are feeding themselves .
we &apos;re going up .
we are at a point , which is the analog to then when the cell organisms have developed too much cell organisms .
so we &apos;re the amox and we can &apos;t quite do what we &apos;re doing on the hell .
we &apos;re in the middle of it .
but i really think something else happens .
i find it very high to say that we are the end product of evolution .
and i think we all here are part of the creation of what &apos;s going on next .
now , lunch is before and i think i &apos;m going to hear right now before i get selected .
my story starts right here in rajasthan , about two years ago .
i came together underneath the starsky in the desert with sufi singer muckens ali .
we talked about nothing changed since the time of ancient indian era , &quot; mahabharata . &quot;
if we wanted indians back at the time , we were going to go into a car and put it on the sky .
now we do this with airplanes .
at the time , when the great indian warrior was the prince arjuna durst , he took a bow , took it into the floor and water .
now we &apos;re doing this with power and machines .
we came to the conclusion that magic and magic were replaced by machines .
it really made me sad .
i got something scared of technology .
it made me feel that i could lose the ability to enjoy the sunset without camera and no tweet to my friends .
i found that technology should make magic and not kill .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little silver bag .
the piece of 50 years old technology became the most magical thing for me .
it became a golden access to a world full of pirates and contaminated ships , and in my imagination .
i came up with this when i thought we were sending clocks and cameras out of it .
they were inspired to be inspired by us .
and so i went to the world of technology to see how i could use it to allow magic to kill .
with 16 , i started illucating books .
when i saw the ipad , i saw this as a device for storytelling that can connect readers around the world .
it can know how we hold it .
it can know where we are .
it picks up images and text , and animation , sounds and touch .
the storytelling always took more sense .
but what do we do with it ?
i &apos;m just going to khoya , an interactive ipad app .
it says , &quot; your fingers on every light . &quot;
and so -- here is , &quot; this box belongs ... &quot; i write my name .
and i get a character in the book .
and again , a letter goes down to me -- and the ipad knows through gps where i live -- that &apos;s right to me .
the child in me is really excited about this possibility .
i talked a lot about magic .
i mean , i don &apos;t mean magician and kites , but the magic of childhood , those ideas that we all had as children .
fireflies in a glass i found quite exciting .
so you have to leave the ipad out here and the fireflies .
and the light path through the rest of the book .
another idea that &apos;s fascinated me as a child is that a whole galaxy can put in a single murmel .
and so every book here is going to be a little murmel that i &apos;m wearing here to the magic device .
and this opens up a map .
fantasy books always had maps , but these maps were static .
this map grows and lights up , and it &apos;s using guidance in the rest of the book .
it also shows in other places of the book .
i go in here .
it &apos;s also important for me to create something that is inpractical but also very time-based .
this is the apsaras .
we &apos;ve all heard of feeins and nysions , but how many people know outside india , the apsaras ?
the poor apsaras was caught thousands of years in indras &apos; 90s , in an old pit book .
and we bring them back to a contemporary story for kids .
a story that has come apart with new issues like the environmental crisis .
the environmental crisis , a big problem of the last 10 years , is that children in their rooms are sitting in their rooms , without getting out .
but now , with mobile technology , we can take our kids into the natural world with their technology .
in an interaction of the book , you &apos;re sent to a search , you have to go out and collect with the camera of the ipads of natural objects .
as a child , i had collections of story , rocks , cuesles and shells .
somehow the kids don &apos;t do it anymore .
this is a childhood ritual coming back . you have to go out to make a picture of a flower and mark it .
in another chapter , you have to be a piece of construction mri and tag .
so you actually create a digital collection of photos that you can put online .
a child in london shows the picture of a piece of fusion and says , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve seen a fusion . &quot;
a child in india says , &quot; i &apos;ve seen a monkey . &quot;
this creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photos that you actually recorded .
there &apos;s a variety of opportunities to connect the world and the technology .
in the next book , we &apos;re planning a interaction where you &apos;re using the video of the ipads , and through augmented reality , you see an animation coming out of the house .
at one point , the screen is moving with leaves .
you have to make the sound of the wind , you blow away and read the rest of the book .
we all move to a world where nature is closer and closer in the magic and technology .
we use the energy of the sun .
we bring our kids and closer to the natural world , and the magic , fun and love of our childhood through the simple medium of a story .
thank you .
this is really an extraordinary honor for me .
i spend most of my time with people in research , prisons or death cells .
i spend most of my time with the socially poor in the social budget and places where there is a lot of hope .
being here at ted , to see and hear how motivates this is , i &apos;ve given a lot of force .
in the short time here , i realized that ted has an identity .
you can say things that have influence worldwide .
and sometimes if something comes over ted , it gets meaning and force that otherwise wouldn &apos;t have .
i say that because i think identity is very important .
we saw some amazing presentations .
i think we &apos;ve learned that the words of an educational meaning , but the words of a dedicated educational teacher are especially meaningful .
as a doctor , you can do good things , but you can still do more .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
i didn &apos;t know that in my work as a lawyer .
i learned that from my grandmother .
i became big in a family , a traditional african-american household , who was dominated by a matriarch in , and this matriarch was my grandmother .
she was a taffe , strong woman , she had effect .
she had the last word in every family .
it was also the beginning of a lot of rules in our family .
she was the daughter of a slave family .
her parents were born in the 1840s in virginia as a slave .
it was born in 1880 , and the experience of slavery was very strong .
my grandmother was strong , but she was loving .
if i met her as a little boy , she came up to me and hugged me .
she hit me that i couldn &apos;t breathe . then she left me .
one or two hours later , if i published her , she came up to me and said , &quot; do you feel my hug ? &quot;
and if i said , &quot; no , &quot; she would admit me again . if i said , &quot; let me leave you . &quot;
she was something that was made that you wanted to be near her .
the only problem was that she had 10 children .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
sometimes if i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to get your attention .
my cousins went around everywhere .
i remember , i have to be eight or nine , that i woke up one morning and went into the living room . all my cousins went around .
my grandmother was at the end of the room , and i went on .
first of all , i thought that was a game .
i looked at her and smiles , but she looked very serious .
and that was so 15 or 20 minutes , and then she stood up and came to me over . she took me on my hand , and she said , &quot; come on , we have to talk . &quot;
i remember when it was yesterday .
i &apos;ll never forget it .
she took me out , and i said , &quot; bryan , i &apos;ll tell you something , but you &apos;ve got to say that you don &apos;t say it . &quot;
i said , &quot; grandma . &quot;
she said , &quot; excuse me ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
she sat down and looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to know that i watched you . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re a little special . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do anything you want to do . &quot;
i &apos;ll never forget that .
then she said , &quot; you just have to promise me three things , bryan . &quot;
i said , &quot; ok , grandma . &quot;
she said , &quot; first of all , i want you to always love your mom . &quot;
she said , &quot; your mom is my baby , and you have to promise that you &apos;re going to take care of you . &quot;
my mother , so i said , &quot; yes , grandma , i &apos;ll do that . &quot;
then she said , &quot; next i &apos;m always going to do the right thing . &quot; even though it &apos;s hard to do the right thing .
i thought , &quot; yeah , grandma . i promise . &quot;
finally , she said , &quot; the last thing you promise me is that you will never drink alcohol . &quot;
well , i was nine years old and i said , &quot; yeah , grandma . i promise . &quot;
i grew up on the land in the old , rural south and i have a brother who &apos;s older , and a year older sister .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day , my brother came home and brought this sixth pack beer for my sister and went to the forest .
we just mixed around there as well .
then he took a hock beer and offered my sister to one of my sister , and she took me to one .
i said , &quot; no , no , no , no . just do it . i don &apos;t want a beer . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; well , do . we &apos;re doing this today , you &apos;re doing everything else we do .
i had what , your sister had what . go , drink a beer . &quot;
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want . just do it . just do it . &quot;
my brother kept staring at me .
he said , &quot; what about you ? &quot; now , what about you ?
then he looked at me and said , &quot; oh no , you don &apos;t always make you crazy because of the conversation with grandma ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; grandma tells all of us that they are special . &quot;
i was devastated .
i &apos;m going to give you something .
i should probably not .
this may be established public .
i &apos;m 52 years old , and i &apos;m standing , i &apos;ve never drink a drop of alcohol .
i &apos;m not saying that because i think it &apos;s pure . i say that because identity is power .
if we create the right kind of identity , we can tell people things that they don &apos;t believe .
we can get them to do things that they thought they could not .
of course my grandmother would say , they &apos;re something special .
my grandfather was in prison during the prohibition .
my uncle died of alcoholinduced diseases .
and she believed that this was the issues that we need to take care of .
i tried to say something about our justice system .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
in 1972 , 300,000 people in prison and prison were in prison .
today , it &apos;s 2.3 million .
the united states today has the highest incarceration rate of the world .
seven million people are released on a currency or with conditional criminal justice .
i think , in my opinion , mass divers are fundamentally changing our world .
in social and black parts of the population , philanthropy and sms share despair , because of that change .
one of three male black blocks between 18 and 30 is in freezing , in prison , on currency , or with unconditional parking .
in urban communities all over the country -- from los angeles about philadelphia , baltimore to washington -- are 50 to 60 percent of all black young men either in prison , in the prison , on a currency , or with inconditional criminal .
but our system is not just shaped by questions that have to do with lorcity , it &apos;s also caused by poverty .
we have a justice system in this country that you &apos;re treating much better when you &apos;re rich and guilty than poor and innocent .
assets , not debt , affect the outcome .
yet we seem to be happy with that .
a policy of fear and anger has convinced us that these problems are not our problems .
we &apos;ve lost the contact .
i find that interesting .
there are some very interesting developments .
my home state , in alabama , pulls them permanent , when they &apos;re prosecuted .
and today , in alabama , 34 percent of the male &apos;s black population has been permanently lost .
we predicted that in 10 years , the rate of the civil honor is going to be so high as the end of the election rule .
the silence is osternumb .
i offer kids .
many of my clients are very young .
the united states of america is the only country in the world that was convicted of three years of death in prison .
in this country , there are children living in life for children without transmission .
we have a lot of practice already .
the only country in the world .
i offer people in death cells .
the death issue is an interesting question .
we think , because you &apos;ve taught us that the real question is , does a human mind deserve to die for one of him ?
this is a very intimate question .
but you can also think differently about how we see our identity .
the other view is not , did anybody deserve for a crime , but : did we deserve to kill ?
i find that fascinating .
the death penalty workers defined by error .
on nine people that we &apos;ve been executed , comes from one that we &apos;ve found for innocent , who &apos;s been released and made out of death .
an amazing error rate . one of nine innocent .
i find that fascinating .
we would never let anyone fly with an airplane , if for nine planes , that drop down .
but somehow we do it from this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden .
it &apos;s not our fight .
i &apos;m talking a lot about these questions .
i talk about race and the question , whether we have the right to kill .
and it &apos;s exciting because i teach my students african-american story , i talk about slavery .
i talk about terrorism , the time at the end of reconstruction , to the beginning of the world war .
we don &apos;t really know very much about it .
but for the african-american in this country , it was a time of terror .
in many areas , people had to have fear of lynchmobs .
or before bombs .
it was the fear of terror that shaped her life .
these older people are now coming to me and say , &quot; mr. , stevenson , you &apos;re talking , you &apos;re talking to the people that you should stop saying that we should stop doing it for the first time in our nation . &quot;
they say , &quot; no -- tell people that we grew up . &quot;
and then , of course , after terrorism , the rasacings came and decades of the rassistic motivated and apartheid .
and yet , in our country , there &apos;s a dynamic -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
and that &apos;s why we don &apos;t really understand what our actions are in the historical context .
we &apos;re constantly chasing each other .
we create new tensions and conflicts .
it &apos;s hard to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to approach the process of truth and reconciliation .
in south africa , people have understood that the rasacets are not overcome without the willingness to get to truth and reconciliation .
even after the genocide in rwanda , there was this willingness , but not in this country .
i &apos;ve given some talks in germany about death .
it was fascinating because one of the scientists stood after my talk , and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply disturbing , you &apos;re talking about listening . &quot;
he said , &quot; there &apos;s no death in germany .
and of course it can never give you more . &quot;
it was very silent . then a woman said , &quot; with our history , it &apos;s impossible that we &apos;re ever talking to the systematic killing of people .
it would be about us , consciously , and informed people . &quot;
i thought about it .
what it would feel like to live in a world where german state would set people up , especially if there were a lot of jews .
it would be outrageous .
it would be knowledge .
and yet , here in this country , in the states of the modern south , we set people down -- here &apos;s the risk of being convicted of death , 11 times higher , if the victim is white , and the victim knows the body right now in the same states .
and yet there &apos;s this mental impact .
i think our identity is threatened .
if we don &apos;t deal with that , with these difficult topics , the positive and wonderful things are also affected .
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity .
we love entertainment .
but then finally , these realities are going to overend by suffering , abuse , reformers .
i think it seems important to unite both .
because we ultimately talk about that we need more hope that we need more hope , more commitment , more commitment to a complex world .
for me , the time to try to think and talk about the poor , the disadvandent , that never will be at ted .
but think of a way that is embedded in our own lives .
we all need to think about things that we can &apos;t see .
we do that . so we &apos;re also rational , so we value the intellect .
innovation , creativity , and development doesn &apos;t just come from our heads .
they come from ideas that are driven by the belief in our hearts .
it &apos;s this headheart connection that i think is driving us , not just being open for all the light and excitement things , but also for the dark and problematic .
vaclav hahar , the great cheechan politician once said .
&quot; when we fought in eastern europe , we wanted to do all sorts of things , but what we needed most was hope , a mental orientation that , sometimes to be hopeful , and witness . &quot;
this mental orientation is the core of what i believe that the ted communities have to get involved in it .
there &apos;s no disconnect for technology and design that allows us to be very , very , very human , as long as we don &apos;t have eyes and ears for poverty , which is , and injustice , and injustice .
i want to warn you . this kind of identity is a lot more of us than if we don &apos;t care about it .
it &apos;s going to touch it deeply .
when i was a young lawyer , i privilege to meet pink parks .
woman was always back back to montgomery , where she was giving two of her oldest friends , these older women , johns never carr , who had organized the montgomery bus -- an incredible african-american whose husband , clifford durr , dr. king .
so these women met , and they just turned out .
and then the woman named carr then , and then he said , &quot; bryan , a church comes into the city . we want to talk .
do you want to come and listen ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yeah , very like . &quot;
she said , &quot; and what are you going to do when you &apos;re here ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
and i went over and i just heard .
it was so inspiring , so it was so inspiring .
and one day i was sitting there , and i heard these women , and after a few hours , a woman turned to me to tell us , &quot; well , bryan , you tell me what &apos;s right to be right .
what do you try to achieve ? &quot;
i started with my usual talk .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to go to injustice .
wr , people want to help the innocent ones .
we want to fight premissions and discrimination in the criminal justice system .
we want to be able to make habitats of life without transmission for children .
we want something against death companies .
we want to lower the number of sharks .
we want to create mass gridlock . &quot;
i gave my usual talk , and then she looked at me and said , &quot; mhmm . mhmm . mhmm . &quot;
she said , &quot; it will be very , very tired . &quot;
then he refused to me , put a finger on my face , and i said , &quot; and therefore you have to be very , very big . &quot;
and that &apos;s why i think the ted community should be .
we have to rethink ways of making these challenges : these problems , this suffering .
because ultimately , our humanity depends on our humanity .
i learned very simple things in my work .
i learned a few very simple things .
that we &apos;re all more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
i think that &apos;s true for everybody on the planet .
if someone is lying , it &apos;s not just a liar .
if someone takes something , it &apos;s not just a prib .
even who kills somebody is not just a killer .
and because that &apos;s a fundamental human dignity that has to respect the law .
i also believe that in many parts of this country , and with safety in many parts of the earth , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i don &apos;t believe that .
i think that too many places the opposite of poverty is justice .
and finally , i believe that even though they &apos;re so dramatic , so beautiful and inspiring , and so inspiring , we &apos;re not based on our technology , not in the things that we &apos;re developing , not our intellect and minds .
and then finally , a society is not measured by how they get their rich and powerful and privileged and privileged , but how they deal with the poor .
because in this context , we start to understand the truly amazing things that make us .
sometimes i get the balance . a story to end .
sometimes i urge too much .
i &apos;m getting tired of how we all are .
sometimes these ideas are present to our thinking , in a very important way .
i offer these kids to be convicted of very hard property .
i go to prison , and i go to a client who may be 13 or 14 years old , and it should be as adults .
then i ask myself , how could this happen ?
how can a judge transform somebody who &apos;s not ?
the judge looked at him as adults , but i see a child .
one night i stayed too long , and i thought , oh , if a judge can turn us into something else , it must have magic .
right , bryan , the judge has magic .
you should also wish you .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t really think of it properly , i started working on one of them .
i had a 14-year-old , poor black boy as a client .
and i started with this one , and the headline was , &quot; encourse , my arms , 14-year-old black cobes like a privileged , white , 75-year-old jaws . &quot;
in my head , i explained that failure is the state of state , and the police as well as making it possible .
there was a crazy line about that that in this country , there &apos;s nothing more than that there is still misbehavior .
the next morning i woke up , and i didn &apos;t know if i just dreamed of this crazy , or actually written it .
and i didn &apos;t just write him , but also sent him to the court .
a few months went over and i had just forgotten everything .
but finally , i decided , my god , i must be in the court , and this crazy case .
i went into the car and i was really overwhelmed .
so i went to the court .
and i thought that &apos;s going to be so difficult , so painful .
finally , i went from my car and i went to the court .
when i moved the stairs to the court , there was an elderly black man , black men in the court .
when he saw me , he came to me and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
he came to me and donated me .
then he went to the ear .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of them . &quot;
and i have to say , there was power .
it touched something very deep in me , identity , the ability to contribute every single one , to a community of hope .
well , i walked on the court .
once the judge saw me .
he said , &quot; mr. stevenson , did you have that crazy one ? &quot;
i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and then we started to discuss .
more people came in , just because they were angry .
i wrote that crazy stuff .
police officers came in and placed in the state of state and office workers .
in hand , the court was full of people who were angry , that we were talking about color , about poverty , about inequality .
i looked at the janitors in my eye , and i went down .
he always looked through the window and could hear the whole tohuwbean .
he went down and down .
finally , this older black man came out with a very rich facial face in the court and sat right behind me , almost on the defense bank .
ten minutes later , the judge quit a break .
during the pause , police officer came in , which was disturbing that the janitors was in court .
this deputy ran over to the older black .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do in the court ? &quot;
the older black man stood up . he saw the deputy , then he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;ve come to say that this young man doesn &apos;t lose the end of the eyes , don &apos;t give you the goal . &quot;
i &apos;ve come to ted , because i believe that many of you have understood that the moral pendel of the universe is far out of the universe , but it &apos;s the justice of justice .
that we are not fully developed as humans , as long as we don &apos;t care about human rights and values .
that all of our survival is connected to each individual .
that we need to connect our visions of technology and design , entertainment and creativity with humanity , compassion and justice .
and most of all , i want to tell you about that , just simply saying , lose the goal not from the eyes . don &apos;t give up .
they have seen in this audience , this community , a very apparent wish and heard to help them do something .
what can we do ?
bryan stevenson : well , there are opportunities everywhere .
if you live in california , there &apos;s an underserd in this spring where it &apos;s about , actually , a effort to reframe something from the money that &apos;s going on in the policy of punishment .
here , for example , california is going to be a billion dollars in the next five years for death . a billion dollars .
and yet , 46 percent of all the panels don &apos;t count with one .
56 percent of rape cases don &apos;t come in court .
here &apos;s the opportunity to do something .
this issue is going to suggest the money in more security force and security .
i think there &apos;s opportunities everywhere .
during the last three decades , the crime rate is huge in america .
the fact is , this is a lot of a relationship with the growing rates .
what would you say to someone who believes that ?
well , in fact , the number of nonviolent crimes has not changed very much .
most of the mass divers in this country didn &apos;t really find in the class of nonviolence .
it was the absence of deposited to drugs .
so the dramatic high numbers are coming in the prison inmates .
we were sweating from the rhetoric of punishment .
now , we have &quot; three-fold laws , &quot; the laws of people behind bars , for a bicycle theft , for the theft , rather than that you force them , the things that give back the sacrifice .
i think we need to do more to help people who have become victims of a road , not less .
and i think our current punishment is not helping anybody .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
and bryan , they really have a string to vibrate .
they &apos;re an inspiring personality .
thank you for having been at ted . thank you .

oh my god .
so these are just a few of the clips i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- but they could have been the last six days , or the last six years .
in fact , the media would prefer to show us negative issues , because our minds are paying attention to these issues .
and there &apos;s a very good reason for this .
every second day , our senses will catch much more information than our brain can ever process .
and because we &apos;re not more important than our survival , the first stop for all the information is part of our temporal lobe , the amygdala .
so the amygdala is our early warning system , our risk detector .
it frees and swicks through the whole information on the search for each other to a danger of danger in our environment .
so if we see the news , we prefer to look for negative news .
and the old adage , &quot; if it goes up , the demand is very true . &quot;
now , with all our digital devices that are seven days the week , 24 hours a day , all this negative news is not a miracle that we are pessimistic .
it &apos;s not a miracle that everybody thinks it &apos;s going to be worse .
but maybe it &apos;s not the case .
maybe that &apos;s the reality .
maybe the vast progress that we &apos;ve done in the last century through a series of forces are so strong that it will be possible for us to create a world of overriver .
now , i &apos;m not saying we don &apos;t have big problems -- climate crisis , species , water and energy problems -- we have already .
and as humans , we &apos;re much better at looking at problems in a very long way , but they eventually get to overcome .
let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve done in the last century , so we can see the development .
in the last 100 years , the average life expectancy has doubled more than doubled the average income of the world &apos;s population .
child mortality has a tenth .
and that is that the diet , electrical transportation and communication costs have reduced a vast amount of waste .
steve pinker showed us that we currently live in a very peaceful time of human history .
and according to charles kenny &apos;s literacy rate in the past 130 years of 25 percent .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and many people forget this .
and we increase our expectations constantly .
in fact , we have redefined poverty .
consider that a large percentage of americans who live under the poverty line are access to electricity , water , toilets , refrigerators , tv , mobile phones , climate change and cars .
the richest capitalists of the last century , the empires of the earth , would have never been able to have a luxury .
the basis of a lot of these technologies , and they grow expotentially .
my good friend ray kurzweil has shown us that every tool that &apos;s going to make information technology , on the curve of moore &apos;s law , is doubling all 12 to 24 months .
that &apos;s why the cell phone costs about a million times less and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer in the &apos; 70s .
now look at this curve .
this is moore &apos;s law for the last hundred years .
notice two things on this curve .
first of all , as smooth as it is -- in good times , war or peace , recession , depression , depression , depression .
this is the result of fast computers that build fast computers .
they slow down for none of our big problems .
also , despite yours on the left , it &apos;s moving up .
so the growth rate is accelerating .
and on this curve , on the back of moore &apos;s law , we find a series of extraordinary technologies that are available to everyone .
cloud d computing , something that my friends call in autodesk computing computing , sensors and networks , robots , 3d , games that allow the personal production to our planet , synthetic biology and artificial intelligence .
how many of you have seen the victory of ibm &apos;s supercomputer at risk ?
it was grandios .
i used to go through the newspapers , looking for the best headlines i could find .
i love this : &quot; watson forces human enemies . &quot;
&quot; risk is not a simple game . &quot;
it &apos;s about understanding the language of language .
imagine that this artificial intelligence every owner of a mobile phone is available .
four years ago , ray kurzweil and i launched a new university here at ted university .
we bring our students all of these technologies to focus on how they can be used to solve the great challenges of humanity .
and every year we ask the students to create business , products and services that can be positive within a decade of a billion people .
think of that a group of students today can influence the lives of billions of people .
30 years ago , this would have been ridiculous .
today , we can put together dozens of companies that have done this .
when i think about creating abundance , i don &apos;t mean a life full of luxury for everyone on this planet ; it &apos;s about creating a life full of possibilities .
it &apos;s about creating scarce goods .
so scarcity is conquote , and technology is a resource force .
here &apos;s an example .
this is the story of napoleon iii. in the middle of the 18th century .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
he invited the king of siam to dinner .
napoleon soldiers got silver bribe , napoleon himself , gold-bribe .
the king of siam , though , got marines .
aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet , more valuable than gold and platin .
this is why the dome of the wash sound monuments was made of aluminum .
although aluminum takes 8.3 percent of the earth &apos;s mass , it doesn &apos;t come as a metal .
it &apos;s connected to oxygen and copper .
but then the technology of electrolysis developed , and made aluminum so cheap that we use it with our limitations .
then let &apos;s put these analogy into the future .
we think of energy scarcity today .
ladies and gentlemen , we &apos;re living on a planet of 17000-times more energy than we use every year .
16 terawatts of energy is all 88 minutes on the earth &apos;s surface .
it &apos;s not about scarcity , the problem is accessible .
and there &apos;s good news .
in this year , you &apos;ve done it for the first time , the cost of solar power in india to 50 percent of the eco-stream -- 8,8 rupees compared to 17 rupees .
the cost of solar energy in the last year was 50 percent .
last month , this has been published with a study that shows that until the end of this decade in the sunny areas of the united states , solar is going to cost about 15 cents a kwh in the national average .
and if we have an energy overload , we &apos;ll also have water in it .
let &apos;s talk about water wars .
do you remember that as carl sagan is in 1990 , when it was pulled by saturn , back towards the earth ?
he took a famous photograph . how did it mean ?
&quot; a meritoc dot . &quot;
because we live on a water planet .
we live on a planet that &apos;s covered 70 percent with water .
yes , it &apos;s 93-5 percent of salt , two percent are exobed , and we &apos;re fighting 0.5 percent of the water on the planet , but there &apos;s also hope .
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
it &apos;s new nanotechnology on the way , nano-materials .
and from a conversation today , with dean kaman , one of the innovators of doing it , i want to share with you -- he gave me the permission -- he gave me the permission -- his technogshot , the &quot; slingshot , &quot; and a lot of you may have heard of . it has the size of a refrigerator .
it can produce a thousand gallons of clean water per day -- whether salt , polluted water , latrine -- and all that for less than two cents a liter .
the president of coca-cola has just agreed to launch a big test project with a hundred units in developing countries .
and if everything goes well , and i &apos;m very confident , then coca-cola will apply this technology to 206 countries all over the planet .
this is technology supporting innovation that is there today .
and we &apos;ve seen this in mobile phones .
you my goodness , we &apos;re going to get the 70 percent off of mobile phones in the developing world to the end of 2013 .
just remember , a maasman warrior with a cell phone in the middle of kenya has a better mobile communication than president reagan 25 years ago .
and if you look at google with your smartphone on google , you have more access to knowledge and information than president clinton 15 years ago .
they live in a world that has information and communication in how it would have ever predicted .
and there &apos;s even better things that you &apos;ve spent , and i &apos;ve spent a couple of thousand dollars -- gps , hd video and photograph , libraries and music , technology of books , and music , technology to medical imaging -- are literally being made and cheaper in your cell phone .
and the best part is perhaps what we expect in health .
in the last month , i had the pleasure with the quality foundation that was called &quot; $ 10 million power comhalds . &quot;
we challenge teams around the world , all these technologies with each other in a cell phone , that you can talk to the device , because it &apos;s with ai , you can test in husts or your blood values .
and to win , the device has to be a better diagnosis than a team of highly skilled doctors .
imagine this device . in the middle of a developing country , where there is no doctors , but 25 percent of the disease burden and 1.3 percent of the staff of healthcare .
if this device sequenced a rna-- or a dna virus that &apos;s not known , it calls the health care and prevents a pandemic in front of you .
but now the biggest power that will lead us to a world of overriver .
i call them &quot; the coming billion . &quot;
the white lines are the population .
we &apos;ve just released the seven-billion token .
and by the way , the biggest disproportionation of a population explosion is a better education explosion and nutrition in the world .
in 2010 , we &apos;ve been connected to two billion people online .
by 2020 , we face two billion internet users .
three billion new minds , which we &apos;ve never heard before , will join global communication .
what do people need ?
what are you going to consume ? what will you want ?
and instead of economics , i see one of the greatest economic supplies of history .
these people represent multiple trillion dollars in the global economy .
and they &apos;re going to become healthier through the use of the tricoon , and they &apos;re trained to be trained by the khan academy , and by using them to have the possibility , 3d computing , and so much more productive than ever before .
so what can we get three billion growing , healthy , educated , productive members of human community ?
how about a sentence of new , never heard before ?
how about it , the oppressed , where they are , to give you a voice to make sure and make change , for the first time ?
what will these three billion people bring ?
how about sharing that we can &apos;t even predict ?
one of the things that i learned by the x prize is that small teams that motivate through passion and focus can create extraordinary things , things that the great companies and governments can only create in the past .
i want to conclude with a story that really excites me .
there &apos;s a program that some might already know .
it &apos;s a game called the implication .
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
and it &apos;s a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids to explore how the protein will evolve .
depending on its behavior , we can predict the structure and function .
and this is very important in medical research .
so this was a problem for supercomputer .
and this game was played by university professors .
and it &apos;s now hundreds of thousands of people playing the game online .
and it turns out that today , human pattern recognition is the proteins of the proteins than the best supercomputers .
and when these people came and looked at who &apos;s the best of a life folder in the world , this was not an m.professor , even no caltech student , it was a woman who was working as an assistant of business office in a rejuring hospital at night , the best of the world .
ladies and gentlemen , which gives me enormous trust in our future , is that we have more power today than individuals to make us the great challenges of our planet .
we have access to tools with exponential technology .
we have the passion of a diy innovators .
we have the capital capital of technology .
and we have three billion new minds that we can work online to master the new challenges , and to do what &apos;s required .
we expect a few extraordinary decades .
thank you .
i think we need to do something against an operational value of medical culture .
and i think it starts with a medical doctor and i &apos;m .
and maybe i &apos;ve been in business for a long time when i can allow it to give me a piece of my own wrong preference .
but before i come to the actual issue of my talk , let &apos;s start with a little baseball .
hey , why not ?
we are the seasonal near and moving to the world championship .
we all love baseball , right ?
baseball is full of great statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
&quot; moneyball &quot; seems to happen soon and turn around statistics and to make this a great baseball team .
i &apos;m going to look at a statistic that i hope most of you have heard about .
it &apos;s the average performance of the bat .
we talk about a 300 , if a bat will beat 300 .
that means that the player &apos;s safe for three beats .
that &apos;s called the ball in the field , and he &apos;s coming up , he &apos;s not caught , and who &apos;s trying to throw the ball to the first base , it didn &apos;t have any time in time .
three out of 10 .
do you know how to call a 300000-year-old baseball baseball ?
well , really good , maybe a nuclear star .
you know how to name a 400ter ?
this is somebody in the rest of the 10 .
celebrity williams -- like ted williams legendary -- the last great singularity player player who met during a regular season over 400 times .
let &apos;s go back to my world of medicine , in which i feel a lot more good or maybe a little bit less than i &apos;ve talked to you about .
so suppose you have a blind arm , and you will overlay it into a operber , the average performance of 400 in terms of light .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
imagine if you live in a certain remote area , and you have a beloved man with clogged heart disease , and you &apos;ve got your home your home to a carrot , the average performance at 200 .
but you know what ?
it &apos;s a lot better this year . it &apos;s on the rise .
and she gets a 257 .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
what do you think the average performance for a carrot or a nurse or an orthopedier , should be an orthopjurer , a rescue of life ?
1,000 , very good .
the truth is that no one in the entire medicine knows what a good surgeon or a doctor should be , or a rescue stent .
but what we do , though , is that we have each of them , including me , in the world to be perfect .
never make any mistakes , but no one makes a difference about the details of how to do this .
and this is the message i took in medical school .
i was a retired obsver student .
in high school , a student said that brian goldmann would learn for a bloody test .
and so it was .
and i learned in my little box in the sisters in the sisters of the toronto general hospital , unfar from here .
i learned everything .
in my case , i learned the origins and the front of every muset , every branch of one of the world &apos;s aorta , which takes away from the aorta , shelter and ordinary differential diagnosis .
i even knew the differential diagnosis to classify renale tubuks .
and the whole time i got more and more knowledge .
and i was good , i went to laude .
and i left the medical school with the impression that i knew if i knew everything and knew everything , or at least as close as possible , that i could make immun against mistakes .
and it worked for a time until i met a printer .
i was resistant to a hospital hospital in toronto , as a woman &apos;s printer in the hospital department of the hospital .
at this point i was at the kardigic layer in the kardigic service .
and it was my mission when the emergency staff were searching to look at emergency patients .
and feedback to my high doctor .
i studied a printer and she was in breathing .
and when i listened to her , she made clubs .
and when i listened to her chest with the stethopad , i could hear a broken sound of the sound on both sides , which told me that she suffered under conventions heart failure .
this is a state in which the heart is failing , rather than pump the entire blood on , a part of the blood in the lung , and so gradually , it came out of the short term .
and that was not a hard thing to do .
i hired them and made me the treatment .
i gave her an idiot . i gave her medicine to take the pressure from the heart .
i gave her medicine , which we call diuretics , water pills , so that they put the liquid .
and over a period of time to two hours , she started feeling better .
i felt really good .
and i made my first mistake ; i sent them home .
i actually did two mistakes .
i sent them home without talking to my high doctor .
i didn &apos;t take the links and i did what i had to call a call in my high doctor &apos;s office , so he had a chance to make a picture .
and he knew it , he would have been able to control additional information .
maybe i did it with good reasons .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be a doctor &apos;s help .
maybe i wanted to be so successful , so i could be able to take more responsibility , that i would be able to make sure for my patients without having to contact it .
my second mistake was worse .
so that &apos;s what i sent you home , i did a quiet voice , i tried to say , &quot; goldman , no good idea . do not do that . &quot;
in fact , it lacked me so much of self-security that i asked the nurse , which was about a woman &apos;s printer , &quot; do you think it &apos;s okay if you go home ? &quot;
and the nurse thought about it , and he said , &quot; sure , i think it &apos;ll go well . &quot;
i remember when it was yesterday .
so i signed up the remarks and a hospital and rescue and rescue and brought them home .
and i went back to work .
the rest of the day , i had this one feeling in my stomach .
but i kept working on it .
and at the end of the day i grabbed my stuff , and i went to the hospital , and i went home to drive the car home , when i did something that i didn &apos;t do .
i went home through the emergency department of my way home .
and there was another nurse there , not the sister who had seen it after woman &apos;s printer , but another three words , and i fear those three words that i know .
other doctors are afraid , but the emergency medicine is particularly , because we see the patients just like that .
the three words loud : remember ?
&quot; remember the patient you went home ? &quot;
she asked the nurse .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said , &quot; she said this particular pitch .
so she was back .
she was back and dying .
about an hour after she arrived at home , after i sent them home , they came up and the family called 911 .
she &apos;s barely angelmeated and she was in blue .
the emergency staff did all strands .
they gave her blood pressure .
they went to the beatle machine .
i was shocked and in the back .
and i was living through these acheraster , because she stabilized the intensive care station , and i hoped she would recover .
and after two , three days became clear that she would never get back .
she had not suffered a brain damage .
her family gathered .
and over the course of the next eight or nine days , they gave themselves a handle .
on the day day , she would go -- wife printer , a woman , a mother and grandmother .
you say that you will never forget the names of the people .
and that was the first time i learned this .
the next couple of weeks , i turned out to suggest , and i first learned the unhealthy shame that exists in our medical culture -- i felt myself alone , not the kind of healthy shame that you feel because you can &apos;t talk about the colleagues .
you all know the healthy shame , if you give a secret of the best friend , even though that one on a disclosure , and then you hit the best friend , and then you hit the best friend , if you &apos;re not doing the bad thing , you can never make a mistake again .
if you do refine and never make the mistakes again .
this is the kind of educational shame .
the unhealthy way that i &apos;m talking about is that it &apos;s a very sick one .
it &apos;s the one that says that it &apos;s not what you &apos;ve done bad , but you &apos;re bad .
and that was what i felt .
and it wasn &apos;t on my head , it was very dear .
he spoke to the family , and i &apos;m sure he made the glass glass and sure that i didn &apos;t break .
but i hired to these questions .
why didn &apos;t i ask the high doctor ? why did i go home ?
and then in my worst moments , how could i make a dumb mistake ?
why did i go to medicine ?
but slowly , it made it safe .
i started feeling better .
and then in a single day , there was a hole in the clouds , and the sun broke up and i said , maybe i can feel better again .
and i was talking to myself that if i doubled my efforts to the perfection , and never put a mistake again , the voice could be silent .
and she did .
and i kept working on it .
and then it happened again .
two years later , i had service at the emergency center in an alien hospital north of toronto , and i hired a 25 years old man .
it was much more and i &apos;m in a hurry .
he always showed up here .
i looked in the hall and it was a little pink .
and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him .
and even when he went out of the door , he showed his head .
two days later , i came to my next emergency service and my chedyzine asked me a conversation in her office .
and she said three words : do you remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patients with the painted raws ? &quot;
it turned out he was a proptocock infection .
he had a potentially hostile disease called eglottitis .
you can google the google , but it &apos;s not an infection , but it &apos;s the upper respiratory lanes and causes the amount of breath .
and fortunately he didn &apos;t die .
he got intravenous antibotica and raised a few days later .
and i went back through the same torering of shame and self-doubt , felt , and went to work to work again and again and again .
in an emergency layer , i have two times a blind arm .
you know , there &apos;s a lot of things to think about , especially if you think about working in a hospital that had only 14 patients a night .
in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home and there was no man in their treatment .
i thought he had kidney stones .
i put an x-ray of the kidgue , and when it was without the fund , my colleague had a revision at the patient &apos;s perception of the patient in the lower right sector .
the other one had strong diarrhea .
i woke up to rehyids around him and asked my colleagues too .
and he did , and he did , as he pointed out , in the right sector , called the potato .
in both cases , operified and it was good .
both of those cases me , ask me .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst mistake happened only in the first five years , which many of my colleagues claim , but total nonsense .
some of my clones happened over the last five years .
alone , damage and without support .
here &apos;s the problem : if i don &apos;t end with my fault and talk about it , if i can talk to the quiet voice , if i can tell you what happened to me , how did i do it with my colleagues ?
how can i teach them my mistakes so that they don &apos;t commit the same ?
if i was in a room -- now , i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re thinking about me .
when did you hear the last time of someone who talked about misbeat over failure ?
oh yeah , you go to a cocktail party and you like to hear about any doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody talking about your fault .
if i was in a room full of colleagues , and i would ask them to share their immediate support and to tell them what i &apos;ve just told you , i &apos;m not going to reach the end of the second story before it really would get a joke , you would get a joke and forget the rest .
and in fact , if i knew or knew my colleagues that an orthopedian in my hospital would have taken the wrong leg , believe me , i would have trouble to look at it in the eyes .
this is the system that we live in .
it &apos;s a totally denial of mistakes .
it &apos;s a system in which there are two basic positions -- the ones who make mistakes and those who don &apos;t make them . those who are sleeping , who are sleeping with bad outcomes and with good outcomes .
it &apos;s almost an ideological response like antibodies , which is a human attack .
and there &apos;s the idea that if we make those who make mistakes out of medicine , that we have an secure system .
but there are two problems .
in my about 20 years of the medical experience , journalism , i &apos;ve created a personal medical study about medical errors and wrong treatments to make all kinds of difference for one of my first papers , which i wrote for the toronto star , black , black , wrote , learning .
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely irrelevant .
we &apos;re working on a system in which one of 10 media changes is either a false or wrong thing , in the hospital infections , and all of a sudden causes , or dead .
in this state , about 24,000 canapans are dying of rejuvenating mistakes .
in the united states , we added the institute for medicine in 100,000 .
both are strong , because we don &apos;t look at the problem as much as we should .
and it &apos;s the crux .
in a hospital system in which medical knowledge is doubling every two or three years , we can &apos;t keep up .
sleep scarcity is ubiquitous .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we have a cognitive error , so that we can take a perfect disease for a patient with breast pain .
and then i take the same patient with breast pain , and i &apos;m going to tear it up and give it a little bit of alcohol and give you a little bit of alcohol , and all of a sudden , the story goes through .
i don &apos;t take the same course .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things in the same way .
and my patients are not cars ; they &apos;re not always telling me their symptoms in the same way .
all this is inevitable .
so if you take the system like that , how i was taught it , and all of the flapping health care professionals , it &apos;s at the end nobody left .
and you know about people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
in my show &quot; white , black , &quot; i have the habit of saying , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; i would say , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; i would say , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , &quot; whatever ? &quot; and then i show the microphone .
and then your pups expand , you &apos;ve come out of your head , then you look down and it &apos;s hard , and you start to tell your stories .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
they want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t do the same mistake i made . &quot;
what you need is an environment that you can get into it .
what you need is a new medical culture .
and it starts with a doctor .
the new definition of defining physician is a human being knows about his humanity , accepted , it &apos;s not proud of making mistakes , but it does something that can be passed on .
they share their experiences with others .
they supported when they talk about their mistakes .
and it shows other people their mistakes , not to get their own , but in a loving way that all of them benefit from .
and she &apos;s working in a medical culture that recognizes that people fill the system with life , and when that is , people also make mistakes from time to time .
so that the system evolved to create backups , which make it easier to find mistakes that people are doing easier to create , and to create it as much as useful , to create the health care , in fact , things like that .
my name is brian goldman .
i &apos;m the defining doctor .
i &apos;m a person . i make mistakes .
i &apos;m going to do it . but i &apos;m trying to learn a best way of learning about it .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re holding from me , but i can live .
let me close with three words , i remember .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny little idea .
it &apos;s about changing externality .
and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i &apos;ll tell you three stories before to use time .
the first story is about charles darwin , one of my heroes .
you know , he was in 1835 .
you might think it &apos;s finken , but it &apos;s not .
he actually collected fish .
he described one of them as &quot; normal . &quot;
it was a group .
until in the &apos; 80s , he turned into great style .
now he stands at the red list .
this story , we &apos;ve heard many times of the galapagos , or from other places , is not very special .
yet , we still come to the galapagos islands .
we still think they &apos;re originally .
the brochells still describe it as untouched .
what &apos;s happening here ?
the second story is to be a different concept , the changing taillty .
because i experienced it when i was visiting a lagoin west africa .
i went there because i grew up in europe and i wanted to work in africa later .
i thought i could integrate .
and i got a terrible sunfire , and i was convinced i really wasn &apos;t born from there .
it was my first sunfire .
as you can see , the salmon of palgos and a couple of mangroves fell down .
there was buntbares of about 20 inches , schwarzkars , a subspecies of steam .
the fish of this bunse were very sophisticated and the fishermen lived well , and they were doing well in ghana .
when i returned 27 years later , the fish went back to half its size .
they &apos;re growing five centimeters .
they had been genetically charged .
it was still fish .
people were still happy .
and the fish had also been lucky to be there .
so it doesn &apos;t change anything , and yet everything has changed .
my third little story tells me about my co-tertership at the introduction of celebration in southeast asia .
in the &apos; 70s -- in the early &apos; 70s , europe has a lot of developmental development projects .
fishing funded countries that started 100 fish , the industrial fishing of this kind of ugly ship called squeara 4 .
i went to this , and we made gifts throughout the south south american ocean and particularly in the javasee .
we didn &apos;t have words for what we started there .
i know it was the bottom of the ocean .
90 percent of our fangs were fums , other animals that are connected to the bottom .
the largest part of the fish , the little dots there on the rubble , have been coral white fish .
basically , the bottom of the ocean was on deck and then thrown back .
these images are extraordinary , because the transition is very quick .
within a year you get a census and starts with the commercial fish .
the reason it &apos;s going to change is -- in this case -- it &apos;s a hard reason or a soft coral , or a soft coral .
this is a dead turtle .
they weren &apos;t eaten ; they threw them away because they were dead .
we started a living .
she wasn &apos;t drunk .
then they wanted to kill them because they could eat them .
in fact , this mountain will be collected by sexing every time you go in areas where you have never been fished .
it won &apos;t be documented .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
we fit our standards to the new level and don &apos;t call us in memory what there was .
if you generalize it , here &apos;s what happens .
on the y-axis , a few good things : biodiversity , number of orca , the green of your country , the water supply .
at the time , it changes . it changes because of the people , of course .
every generation you look at , the images that are going to take you at the beginning of your conscious life , as a standard and become it .
the difference is then being seen as a loss .
but they don &apos;t take the previous losses .
it can give a sequence of changes .
and at the end , they just want to get the lowest record .
that &apos;s exactly what our goal is now .
we want to get things that are gone , or things that are not anymore like they were .
now , you could think that the problem of people who certainly lived as they were living in predators , animals and only realized a few generations of what they did .
because obviously , an animal that was very often used only before it dies .
so you don &apos;t have to have a lot of animals .
you always lose rare animals .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not going to be a big loss .
at the time , we &apos;re focusing on the big animals and the sea are the big fish .
they become rare because we &apos;re catching them .
over time , there &apos;s a little fish left , and we think that &apos;s the disaster .
the question is , why people accept that .
now , because they don &apos;t know that it was different .
of course , many people , scientists , confirm that it was really different .
they &apos;ll confirm it because the evidence of how they were in an early form are not like they would like to get the evidence .
for example , the anecdote , for example , is that the report of a capitalist may look like this in this area , not being used , or by fishing scientists normally , because he &apos;s not going to be interested in scientific .
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , although we live in educated societies , because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
this shows the enormously huge role of a marine reserve .
because through marine reserves , we basically put the past back .
we put the past back , which people can &apos;t understand because the circuitry changes and very low .
so , with that , people who see a marine reserve and they can benefit from the point that allows them to go back .
what about the people that are not possible , because they don &apos;t have access -- the people in the middle west for example ?
here , i think , the art and the film might fill the gap , and simulation .
this is the simulation of chesapeake bay .
a long time ago there was gray whales -- 500 years ago .
and the color notes , you may remember , &quot; avatar . &quot;
if you think about &quot; avatar , &quot; if you think about why people were touching this -- apart from the pocaco tas-story , why were they so touched by the imagery ?
because there &apos;s something going on in a way that &apos;s lost in a way .
so my recommendation , the only one i &apos;m going to give , is in cameron , so he &apos;s playing &quot; avatar ii . &quot;
thank you .
in the &apos; 80s , in the communist east germany , you had to , if you had a typewriter , this one in the government .
they also had to escape a sheet with an unprecedented text machine .
the reason for this : the government could follow back , where a text came from .
they had an article with false thought , they could test the creator of this thought .
and we couldn &apos;t understand how anybody could do something like this , and how much that would hurt the speech .
in our own countries , we would never do something like that .
but if you buy a new color printer in 2011 today , if you &apos;re going to buy a new type of color on the top laser table and print a page , it &apos;s got the page yellow yellow spot on every page , in a pattern that makes the site clear to you and the printer .
this is what happens today .
and no one seems to rain on that .
and that was an example of what our own governments are the technology against us , the citizens .
and this is one of the three main sources of the online problems today .
let &apos;s look at what &apos;s really happening in the world : we can split the attacks in categories .
we have three main groups .
there are online criminals .
for example , this is mr. mckry golubach from fiw in ukraine .
and the theme of online criminals are very easy to understand .
these people deserve money .
they use online attacks to make a lot of money , a huge amount of money .
there are several known cases of online parts of online , mulmillionaire that caused their money through attacks .
this is wladist-sin from tartu in estonia .
this is alfred gonzbolz .
stephen watt .
bjdnn sundin .
these are matthew anderson , tariq al-daa and so on and so on .
these people have come to wealth , but they have acquired it , using it , by using desjan , to steal money from our bank bank , while we &apos;re doing our online banking , or keylogers that have collected our loans on the keyboard while we &apos;re shopping .
the u.s. intelligence agency drar two months ago , the swiss account of mr. sam jain here , and on this account , were 14.9 million dollars as it turned out .
mr. jain himself is on open foot , which is unknown .
and i want to argue that today it &apos;s more likely that we will become victims of an online , than one in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this will be even worse .
in the future , most crimes will play online .
the second group that we see today is not motivated by money .
they &apos;re motivated by something else -- protests about , or by their audience .
groups like anonymous are up to the last 12 months , and they have become one of the main players on the field of online attacks .
so these are the three main stages of attacks : criminals that are doing the money because of doing hackers like anonymous , but the last group are nations , but the last group are the attacks .
there are cases , like the diginotar .
it shows unprecedented what happens when governments attack their own citizens .
diinotar is a complete majustice certificate from the netherlands -- or was it .
in the last fall , it had to be insolted , because diginotar was hacked .
somebody was crushed , and the system had been messed .
and last week in a meeting with dutch administration , i asked one of the founding of this group , whether he was able to make it possible , because of the diginotar hacks .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
now , how are people dying in a row like this ?
diinotar is a certificate .
they sell a certificate .
what do you do with ceramics ?
now , a certificate requires , if you have a website with https , with ssl encrypted services , for example .
now we &apos;re all using , or many of us , gmail or one of their competitors , but these services are particularly common in totalitarian states like iran , where dissidents are using foreign lions like gmail , you know , the local government doesn &apos;t get into your conversation .
but you can do that if you &apos;re in a foreign .
charde-oritional sales , and the fake certificate broke .
and that &apos;s what happens in the case of diginotar .
how about the arab spring and things that have happened for example in egypt ?
well , in egypt , press lorollers in april of 2011 , the main headquarters of egyptian intelligence , and they found a lot of records .
in these records , a folder called &quot; finfisher . &quot;
and in this folder , notes were local in germany , which had sold a few programs to the egyptian government that they had -- in a very large framework -- in the egyptian state of the egyptian citizens .
they had sold this program for 280,000 euros to egyptian government .
the company headquarters is right here .
so western governments feed dead governments with aid , so that they can do their own citizens .
but western governments also help themselves .
for example , in germany , just a few weeks ago , they found the leader of the state of war , which was a trojan who was used by german government administration to put their own citizens .
if you &apos;re suspicious in a criminal case , you &apos;re going to be suspicious of the phone .
but today we &apos;re far beyond that .
they tap their internet connection .
they use resources like the state of the state to shoot their computers with a trojan , which allows them to monitor their entire communication , their online discussions , their paswords .
so if we think about things like this , the obvious answer would be people , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it &apos;s not because i &apos;m a braver citizen .
i don &apos;t have to worry !
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
and that argument doesn &apos;t make sense .
there must be privacy .
privacy is not the debate .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and safety .
it &apos;s a choice between freedom and control .
and as we do today , in 2011 , our governments like trust , though , is every right that we &apos;re willing to do forever .
and trust us , trust , we &apos;re blind to any future government , a government that we might have in 50 years ?
these are the questions that we need to spend the next 50 years .
it may seem strange , but i &apos;m a big fan of concrete blocks .
the first concrete blockstones were produced in 1868 , and in a simple idea , one of the simple ideas : elevation from cement measures that fit together .
concrete building blocks were very fast in the world .
they put us in the position to build things that were bigger than we , buildings , bridges , a rock after another .
essentially , the concrete building block was the building block of our time .
almost a hundred years later , in 1947 , lego came out .
it was called automatically distributed rock .
and within less years , lego raised in every household .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion rocks were produced -- or 75 stones for every person on this planet .
you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to create beautiful houses , beautiful bridges or beautiful buildings .
lego made it possible for everyone .
lego basically has the concrete building block , the building block of the world , and made a building block for our imagination .
in the meantime , in the same year , the bell labs announced the next revolution , the next building block .
the transistor was a little plastic unit that was given us from a world of static , publishing tiles to a world in all interactive .
like the concrete block , the transistor allows us to build much larger , more sophisticated circular spaces .
but there &apos;s a major difference : the transistor was only for experts .
i personally don &apos;t accept the building of our time for experts , and so i decided to change that .
eight years ago , i was at the media lab , and i started to explore this idea of how to do the power of engineers in the hand of artists and designers .
a few years ago , i started to develop littalive .
let me show you how they work .
littvivid is electronic panels that have a specific function .
they &apos;re preevident , light , clay , and sensor .
and the best thing about it is they connect with magnets .
so you can &apos;t put them down .
the rocks are coloring color .
green is a copy , blue is power ; it &apos;s pink , and it &apos;s orange .
so everything you need to do is to connect a blue and a green one , and you can build very quickly .
they add a blue one to a green , and they can make light .
you can put a switch in between and you have a little dimmer .
take the switch out for a pulsmodul , which is here , and you &apos;ve made a little blind .
add this buzzer for an extra effect , and they made a noise machine .
i &apos;m going to stop that .
beyond the simple play , littvivid is actually quite powerful .
instead of being able to program , you have to be able to code or solve , allow you to code with simple , intuitive gestures .
so to accelerate the blind , or slow it down , just turn it on this button , and it makes the impulse faster or slower .
the idea of littliving is that it &apos;s a growing library .
we want to put every single interaction on this world in a durable rock .
lights , sound , solar elements , motors -- everything should be available .
we &apos;ve spread into the kids , and they &apos;re playing with it .
and it was an incredible experience .
the most beautiful thing is , you start to understand the electronics you all around the world and not learn in school .
for example , as a night light works , or why the doors of the ability to go open , or how an ipod responded to touch .
we &apos;ve also brought ourselves to design schools .
so , for example , we had designers with no experience in electronic things that started playing with littliving material .
here we see , with filz , paper and water bottles , like george ...
so a few weeks ago , we brought to risd &apos;s life , and we gave them some designers that didn &apos;t have any technical experience -- just box , wood and paper -- they said , &quot; what . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project that you did , a motor confisent canary .
but wait , this is really my favorite project .
it &apos;s a hummer of dough , fear in the darkness .
for those non-engineers , littliving is another material , electronics just became another material .
and we want to make this material for all available .
so littvivid is open source .
you can go to the website , all the design models , and make it yourself .
we want to create the world of creating the inventor , because this world , in which we live , these interactive world , belongs to us .
so , pull it up and start to invent .
thank you .
