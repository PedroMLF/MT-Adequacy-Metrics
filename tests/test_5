you know , one of the great biases in travel and one of the pleasure in the ethnic research research is to live with the people who remember the old days , and the past that you can feel in the wind is to touch them from the rain glass .
just knowing that jaguz is still traveling beyond the milky way , or the importance of the oldest of the inuit of the inuit of the inuit , or that in the himalayas , the world that we &apos;re living on doesn &apos;t really exist in an absolute sense , which is the idea that the world that we live in , it &apos;s the idea that the world that we live in , is the idea that the world that we live in , is the idea that the world , in which we are living ,
and of course , we all share the same adability .
we &apos;re all born . we bring children to the world .
we run across rituals .
we have to deal with the incurary separation through death , and so it shouldn &apos;t surprise us that we all sing , dance and art .
but interesting is the unique sound of the song , the rhythm of the dance in every culture .
it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s in the forests of borneo , or the voodoo acolyths in haiti , or the warriors in the emperdesert of northern kenya , the cures of the world i &apos;ve traveled to a month in the sahara , or , by accident , is the goandero of the world i &apos;ve traveled to the desert , or even a carak-shepherd in the middle of the sahara .
all these people are teaching us that there are other options , other ways , different ways of guidance on earth .
and this is an idea that , if you think about it , can only compete with hope .
together , the individuous cultures of the world form a network of spiritually and cultural lives , which rotates the earth , and it &apos;s just as important for the earth as the biological life web that you know as a biosphere .
you can imagine this cultural life web as an ethnosphere , ethnosphere can be considered the total total of all thoughts and dreams , myths ideas , inspiration and intuitive , which has been generated by the human imagination since the beginning of consciousness .
race is the great legacy of humanity .
it &apos;s the symbol of all of what we are and what we are as astonishing for as an astonishing thing .
and the same as the biosphere got strong was happening with the ethnic sphere -- just greater speed .
no biologist would say , for example , that 50 percent or more of all species are short before the extinction , because it just doesn &apos;t be true , and yet , this -- the apocalyptic case of cultural diversity in the field of cultural diversity -- is hardly what &apos;s known as an optimistical case of cultural diversity .
and the key indicator is the extinction of languages .
when any of you were born in this room , there were 6,000 languages on earth .
now , a language is not just the sum of the vocabulary or a series of grammatic .
a language is the human mind &apos;s mind .
it &apos;s a means that the soul of a certain culture will find access to the material world .
every language is like an ancient forest of the mind , a turning point , a thought , an ecosystem .
and from these 6,000 languages today , as we &apos;re sitting here in monterey , the half of the people are not whispering into the ears of kids .
they &apos;re not taught more kids . that means that if nothing is done , they &apos;re actually dead .
what could be more important than being lost by the silence , to be one of the last people who speak your language , no way to have the wisdom of the ancestors , or hope to expect children ?
and yet , this horrible destiny actually drives someone on earth , about every two weeks , because every two weeks , one of the two weeks dies , one of the elderly dies and takes the last syllkets of an old language .
and i know some of you say , &quot; is it better ? &quot; would be the world not a better place if we &apos;re all going to speak a language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s be the language of yoruba .
let &apos;s be kogi . &quot;
and then suddenly they would recognize how if they couldn &apos;t speak their own language .
so i want to take you on a journey today through the ethnic sphere , a short journey through the ethnic sphere to try to understand what actually has been lost .
now there are some of us who forget that when i say , &quot; different possibilities of being , &quot; really different possibilities of being my .
so , for example , take this kid of barasana in the northwest of the amazon , the people of the anaconda , believe that they came up with mythologically .
this is a people that are not cognitively different between the colors and green , because the sky shows the forest that people depend on .
they &apos;re called a self-like language , and a marriage proposition that &apos;s called the linguistic exotic gamy : you have to marry somebody who speaks a different language .
all of these are initiated in the mythological past , and the strange thing about these big houses , in which because of the failed six or seven languages , is that you never hear anyone who learns a language .
you just listen and start talking .
or , one of the most fascinating tribes i &apos;ve ever lived with , which i &apos;ve ever lived in in the northeast of ecuador , is an amazing people , the first one in 1958 peace .
in 1957 , five missionaries were trying to get contact and made a great mistake .
they picked up shiny photos from the air , which we would rate as a friendly gesture , and they forgot that these people from the rainforest had never seen anything in their lives .
they took these photographs from the forest floor , tried to see behind the face or the character , didn &apos;t find anything and determination that it was business cards of the devil and killed the five missionaries .
but the waorani didn &apos;t just kill outside the spears .
they went through each other .
54 percent of the deaths happened through sales .
we went back to the genetiaology eight generations and found two cases of a natural death , and when we asked people a little bit of a deal about it , they gave one of the people that he died because of his age , and we killed him with the spears .
but at the same time , they had a clear knowledge of forests that was amazing .
their predators could smell the urine of a 40 steps away , and determine what animal species of this woman was .
in the early 20th years , i got a really amazing task when my professor in harvard asked me if i was interested in going to haiti and to punish the secret societies that were the foundation of duvalier and tonton that was used to make cement .
in order to make a sense of a sense , of course , i had to know something about this remarkable belief of the city of the city , and voodoo is not a cult of black magic .
in the opposite , it &apos;s a complex metaphysical world view .
it &apos;s interesting .
if i asked them to count the great world bank , what would they say ?
christianity , islam , buddhism , florism or whatever .
a continent will always leave , because the guess was that in sub-saharan africa , there was no religious belief in sub-saharan africa , of course there was a voodoo , and voodoo is just the exaggeration of this very profound , religious thought .
but what voodoo does so interesting is this living relationship between the living and the dead .
the living ones .
the ghosts can be picked up by the large water , answers to the rhythm of dance to deny the soul of the living temporary moment , so that the tunisiolyth for a brief moment will become the god .
i want to say the voodoo , &quot; your white goes into church and talk about god .
we dance in the temple and become god . &quot;
and because you &apos;re obsessed with the mind , how can you get damage to it ?
look at this amazing demonstrations : voodoo-akolyths in a transcestate , the fireend coal without combustion , an amazing illustration of the ability to affect the body so that it &apos;s going to hold the body in the extreme arousal .
now , from all the people i met , the cogi from the sierra nevada in northern columbia , the most extraordinary .
offspring , the old tyrannisters civilization , the collective coast level of colombia , and in the sliver of the reception , came back to this people in an isolated volcano massive , which rises over the operator .
in a bloodline continent , these people were the only ones that were never conquered by the spaniards .
until today , you &apos;re going to run from a ritual prietivity , which is education , but it &apos;s very extraordinary .
the young acolyths are separated by the age of three and four years of their families , and in a dark world of the finry , in stone of the glacier for 18 years in the glacier for 18 years , you &apos;ve been burning by the fiber of the glacier that you spend in the lap of the great mother , and you spend some metals to mimic the nine months of pregnancy .
and during that time , they become culturally introduced to the values of their society , values that sustain the claim that their prayers and only their prayers , the cosmic -- or we might say the ecological -- balance .
at the end of this amazing initiation , you &apos;re going to get out of one day , and for the first time in your life , in the age of 18 , you see a sunline , and in this crystal moment of the first light , if the sun starts to green in the detail of the first light landscape , all of which you &apos;ve learned in amazing landscape is going to be all of the things that you &apos;ve learned in an amazing situation . and the priests come back and says ,
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
they call the older brothers , and they say we &apos;re the younger brothers , for the destruction of the world .
now this level of intuition becomes very important .
every time we think of it as the landscape and the landscape , we have either rousuau and the old smells of the noiled wild , which is in its simplification , or on the other hand , and say these people are more connected than we are .
so , one-year-olds are neither sentimental , nor they get abased by nostalgia .
it &apos;s not a lot of space in the malaria condition of asmat or the cold winds of tibet , but they still have shaped a mysterious nimbus of the earth , which is not based on the idea of being aware of the human consciousness because she &apos;s going to breathe in the human consciousness .
now , what does that mean ?
it means that a little kid out of the israeli , which is growing up in the belief that the mountain is an apume mind , which is his destiny , or her destiny , is going to be a very different human , and a different relationship to that resource , and a different relationship to this resource , is that a mountain is growing up .
whether he &apos;s a position of a mind or a pile , it &apos;s irrelevant .
the interesting thing is the metaphor , which defined the relationship between the individual and the nature .
i grew up in the forests of british columbia , and i believed that these forests are going to be there .
that made me a different human being as my friends under the kwap , who believe that these forests are in the place of hukuk and the balnial spirits , and the balnical spirits are living on the north of the world .
now , when you start looking at the idea that these cultures can create different realities , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries , like this plant here .
it &apos;s a photograph i took only last april in the northwest of the amazon .
this is ayahuasca , from which many of you have heard , the most powerful psychotic preparat from the repertoire of the hip .
what ayahuasca makes so intriguing is not just the pharmaceutical potential of this preparity , but it &apos;s actually made out of two different sources , and it &apos;s actually made out of two different sources , on the one hand , there are these wooden caps that make a series of behalates in your mind , but it &apos;s actually the names of a beach in the family called psychotria .
this plant contains some very strong tryptamine , which is the serotonin , dimethane tryptamine &apos;s 5 and abstraxydimeth.com.
if you &apos;ve seen the yanomomi , as you &apos;ve seen this stuff , this substance , that you create from different kinds of species , also formxydimethane trypates .
now , this powder is about to get out of a tissue like this to be made out of a gun , and it &apos;s lost by barocks , and the landing on a sea of electricity .
it will not create a distortion of reality , but the resolution of reality .
i even have to talk to my professor , richard evan shultes , who &apos;s the man who led the psychedelious apples with the discovery of the magic mushrooms in mexico in the next year , and i said that you couldn &apos;t be able to experience these tryptamine as a hallucination .
but the thing about tryptamins is that they can &apos;t be appreciated because they &apos;re in the human gut , of course , called monoamin-oxidase .
you can only be identified with some other chemicals that the mao denlation rives .
now , the fascinating thing is that the beomtus , who are in the lies , are maane , mao , of the kind of thing that is necessary to power the tryptamine . so ask yourself .
how can these people not find out of a flora of the 80,000 species of adstringical plants , these two morphologically unrelated plants , which , if they combine this way , can create a kind of biochemical version , so that it &apos;s all bigger than the sum of its parts ?
we use this great euphemism attempt and error , which turns out to be meaningless .
but you ask americans , &quot; the plant speaks to us . &quot;
so what does that mean ?
this tribe , the cofan , have 17 varieties of ayahuca , which you all see in great distance in the forest that appear for our eyes as a species .
and then you ask them how they do their taxonomy and they say , &quot; i thought you understand something about plants .
i mean , you don &apos;t know anything ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
so , it turns out you take any of the 17 varieties in full moon and you sing them into a different volume .
well , that doesn &apos;t bring you a ph.d. at harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting to count as a tribe .
now , the problem -- the problem is that even among us , the sympathy for the difficult ones , they have to look at them as orginial and colorful , but somehow the real world , that means our world , is ongoing .
so , the fact is that you &apos;re not going to remember the 20th century , in 300 years for his wars or technical innovation , but rather than an era where we are against and the massive destruction of biological and cultural diversity on earth . so the problem isn &apos;t change .
all cultures have been involved in the dance of new possibilities .
and the problem is not technology .
the zepx indians didn &apos;t stop being less on sioux than they were having a bow and arrow of the americans when the americans stopped being the horse and cars .
not change and technology endangered the integrity of ethninosphere ; it &apos;s the ugly face of rule .
and wherever you look around the world , you &apos;re going to discover that these cultures are not the set . these are dynamic living peoples , whose existence is driven by cognitive forces that have been trafficked by their capacity to fill in the forest , whether it &apos;s an disease of deforestation that have been trafficked by half of the south american sea , and now , as in the case of yanoma , it has been wiped out that even half of southeast asia has been cut away in the southern chinese sea
or if we go to the mountains of tibet , where i update a lot of research , you &apos;ll see the ugly face of political dominance .
you know , the genocide , the physical extinction of people , is generally convicted of , but the ethnocide , the destruction of the human beings , not only will not only be convicted , but generally , as part of a development strategy .
and you can &apos;t understand the suffering , if you haven &apos;t seen it on the bottom .
i was once traveling with a young colleague of chankdu in western china through southeast southeast tibet , to lhasa and only when i saw lhasa , and i saw the face behind the statistics that were murdered by the statistics that were murdered . $ 6,000 million people who were murdered during the cultural revolution .
the father of this young man was identified as a pastor lama .
it meant that he had been killed immediately during the chinese invasion .
his uncle trab with her holiness in the diaspora who brought people to nepal .
his mother was being locked up as punishment for -- for the crimes of crime .
he was bathed in the prison of two years in the prison for the prison to hide under her rock keys because she couldn &apos;t live with him .
the sister who did these tapers was taken into an educational camp .
one day she came out of a wribband of maos , and she had to go to a tough band of labor for seven years .
the suffering can be intolerable , but the input of people &apos;s mind is something unforforable .
and at the end of that , we really want to have a choice in a monochromatic world , and we want to live in a polychromatic world of the biodiversity ?
margaret mead , the great anthropologist said , before she died , that it &apos;s their greatest fear that while we move towards a thread , we &apos;re not just going to see the entire bandwidth of human imagination on a single way of thinking , but that someday there would be any other options .
and it &apos;s humbling to think that our species may have existed for 600,000 years .
the neolithic revolution , which brought us to agriculture , and at this moment , was the cult of the seeds of the seed , the poetry of the former prietivity , and the hierarchy created -- just 10,000 years ago .
modern industrial world as we know it is hardly 300 years old .
now , this superficial story doesn &apos;t tell me that we all have answers to the challenges that we have in thousands of years .
if we ask these endangered world cultures to the meaning of human questions , they respond to 10,000 different voices .
and in this song , we &apos;re going to retrace the possibility of what we are : people with full awareness that are aware of the importance that all people and gardens have to flourish in a space . and there are great moments of optimism .
here &apos;s a photograph i took on the northern end of the baffin islands when i went to the narleal hunt , and this man , olmonu, told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
the canadian government is not always a very good deal with the inuit , and during the year of the year of our rule , they were forced to move in settlements .
the grandfather of this old man refused .
the family , the fear of his life , took him all the weapons and all the tools .
now you have to know that the inuit don &apos;t get scared of cold . they used them to their advantage .
the tracks seemed to be in the first place of fish that had been inserted in the caribbean .
the man &apos;s grandfather didn &apos;t teach himself before the arctic night or the wind storm .
he hatched out to the outside , he made his pants out of the sea drum , and he pulled down into his hand , and when the feces started fried , he shaped it into the shape of a graph .
he paused on the sides of the herd , and when it was completely frozen , he would take a dog with it .
he pointed out the dog and improvised , he took the skeleton of the dog and improvised , a slick , spanish a dog , and derolled over the ice knife on the air belt .
you can &apos;t do anything like that .
and this is a symbol of a symbol of the resistance of the inuit and all of the things in the world .
the canadian government gave the inuit in april 1999 , in april 1999 , the complete control of an area that is bigger than california and texas combined .
it &apos;s our new country , and it &apos;s called avsty .
it &apos;s an independent area . they control all the minerals .
an amazing example , like a nation , a state that can seek back to his people and can achieve .
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who traveled to these distant goals of the earth , to realize that they &apos;re not away at all .
they are the countries of someone .
they represent parts of the human imagination back in the past times , and for all of us , the dreams of this children are going to be part of the way the dreams of the hope of hope .
what we eventually try to do in national geographic is that we believe that politicians never achieve anything .
we believe that polemik -- we believe that polemik is not convinced , but we believe that storytelling can change the world , and we &apos;re probably probably the best institution for storytelling in the world .
156 nations send our tv channel .
our magazines are read by millions .
and we &apos;re doing a series of journeys in the ethnic sphere where we take our audiences to places like these cultural wonders , that they &apos;ve looked at it , and hopefully they &apos;re going to pick up a central revelation of anthropology : that this world can take it , to exist in a really multicultural pluralist world where the wisdom can find it in a really multicultural pluralist world .
thank you .
what i first show you , as quickly as possible , is to show , is the fundamental work , a new technology that we microsoft refer to as part of one year ago , and that &apos;s a place where you can either deal locally or you can go out into a local way of visual data .
we see a lot of , many gigabytes of digital photographs here that you get to get seamless and continuously rearrange , in any way that can rearrange .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how much information we look at , how big these collections are or how big the images are .
most of you are digital photos of a camera , but this one is a scan of the library of congress and it &apos;s in an area of 300 megapal .
it doesn &apos;t matter , because the only thing that the performance of a system like this can be , is the number of pixels on your screen in every moment . it also has a very flexible architecture .
this is a whole book , an example of non-visual data .
this is colorful house from dickens . every spold is a chapter .
to prove that it &apos;s really about a text and not a picture , we can do something like this to really show that this one real representation of the plaque and no image is .
maybe this is an artificial way of reading a book .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
this is a realistic case . this is a copy of the guardian .
every big picture is the beginning of a slide .
and that really gives you the pleasure and the good experience of reading a real paper issue of a magazine or a newspaper , which is a kind of a kind of medium with multiple scales .
we also did something about the corner of this particular issue of the guardian .
we designed a false display with very high resolution , which is much higher than a normal display , and we added additional content .
if you want to see the functions of the car , you can see it here .
or other models , or even technical practices .
and this really grabs these ideas to create these limitations for available space on the screen .
we hope that it doesn &apos;t mean pop and other nonsense -- that shouldn &apos;t be necessary .
of course , mapping is one of the really obvious applications for a technology like this .
and i really don &apos;t want to spend a lot of time saying that we &apos;re going to contribute to that domain .
but these are all the streets in the united states .
over the top on the top of the ocean of nasa .
now let &apos;s pull out something else .
this is actually live in the internet . you can test it .
this is a project called photosynth , which is really two different technologies combined .
one is a seadragon and the other one is a very good research about computer vision , which is from noah keene &apos;s , a university student university students in the university of steve siltz .
and rick szeliski research was done a very good collaboration .
so this is live in the internet . it &apos;s driven by seadragon .
you can see that when we create these kinds of views where we can penetrate through images and make this experience of multiresolution resolution .
but the spatial orientation of the images is actually meaning .
the computer account algorithms , they put these pictures together , so they put the real space in which these images , which were all done close to the grassroots rockies in the canadian rockies in the canadian rockies , is you see elements of stabilized slides or panoraman imaging .
i don &apos;t know if i have time to show you other environments .
there are what &apos;s a lot of spatial .
i &apos;d like to show you one of the original data sets of noah , and that &apos;s from a early prototype of photosynth to the first prototype of photosynth that we &apos;ve been working on in the summer to show you what i think it really is the punch line of this technology that is photosynths , and this is not necessarily that obvious when you look at the environments that we have on the website .
we had to worry about the lawyers and so forth .
this is a reconstructed of the cathedral dame , which is only in the computer with images of flickr , just give an emergency lady in flickr , and you &apos;re going to get pictures of men in t-shirts and on the university floor , and so on the university floor , each one of these orites is represented as a model of hearing hearing .
so this is all hamta images , and they all are in relation to each other .
and we can navigate that very simple way .
you know , i &apos;ve never believed that i &apos;m going to work at microsoft .
i &apos;m very grateful for the reception here .
so , i guess you can see that this is a lot of cameras : everything is from the camera camera to professional slrs , a pretty big number of them that have been put together in this environment .
and if possible , i will find some of the strange ones .
many of them are covered by faces and so on .
somewhere here is a series of photographs -- here they are .
this is actually a poster by emergency dame , which was recorded right .
we can shift from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
the point here is that we can do things with social environment , and it &apos;s now collected data from all -- from the collective memory of how , how visual the earth looks -- and everything will be connected .
all these photographs are interconnected and it creates something larger than the sum of the parts .
they get a model that comes from all over the ground .
look at this as the sequel of the work of stephen law&apos;s virtual earth .
and this is something that people use it with the complexity that people use , and their use for the user is increasingly becoming greater .
their own photographs are made with metadata , which has a different person .
if somebody has been struggling , and all of these sacred names have been revealed and divided , who you all are , then my photo of the emergency damre is suddenly covered with all of these data , and i can use it as an origin to dive into this space , and that metaverse , the photos of other people using the use of social experience .
and of course , side product , all of these are the great virtual models of any interesting part of the earth that hasn &apos;t just overflight or satellite images and so on , but through collective memory .
thank you .
now , i understand you right ? your software allows you to have a certain point , within the next few years , all the images that are used by someone in the world in the world ?
yes . it doesn &apos;t do anything else .
if you want to create hyperlinks , it &apos;s between the images .
and she does this because of the content in the images .
and this is really exciting when you think about the amount of semantic information that many of these images have .
as if you do a web search for images where you put sentences and the text of the website , there &apos;s a lot of information about that .
but how would it be if the picture was linked to you ?
then the scope of the semantic cross , and the abundance of it , is really enormous . it &apos;s a classic web effect .
blaise , that &apos;s really incredible . congratulations .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m going to tell you some things from my book , like i hope , in seemingly the other things that you &apos;ve heard , and i &apos;m going to try to create some connections , if you haven &apos;t noticed that .
i want to start with what i call &quot; aw dogma . &quot;
the official dogma of what ?
the official belief of all western industrialized societies .
the official dogma works like this : when our goal is to maximize the collective well-being of our citizens , this is especially by the maximum freedom of the individual .
the reason for this is that freedom is good in itself , valuable , sense , an unspeakable premise for the human .
when people have freedom , each of us is for themselves to do things that we need to maximize and no one has to decide for us .
the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice .
the more choices people have , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , the more common they have .
this is , i think , so deep in our water supply , that it would not come to question .
and it &apos;s also deep in our lives .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what we &apos;re doing in modern progress .
this is my supermarket . no big .
i just want to say a little bit about salatdstead .
there &apos;s 175 dressings in my supermarket , if you don &apos;t count the 10 different olive oils and 12 balzambia that you could buy to make a big number of your own lethes in the store in which it &apos;s not the 175 in the store .
so that &apos;s how the supermarket is .
and then they go to the consumer electronics in order to put a stereo together -- speakers , cd player , radio player , radio , stronger . and there &apos;s so many stereo in this one electronics .
we can put in 6.5 million different hunters together from the components that are offered in this business .
you must admit that this is a big choice .
in other areas , the world of communication .
there was a time when i was a boy , because you could have every phone station you wanted to do as long as ma bell .
they rented their phone . they didn &apos;t buy it . multi-touch .
a consequence of that was that the telephone was never broken .
these days are over .
we have now almost an infinite choice on telephones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
my favorite is that in the middle -- cos3-fold , nasa haar trimmer and crème brélée .
and if you haven &apos;t seen that in your business , you can be sure you &apos;ll soon be there .
and what it does is it makes people go into the business and ask that question .
now , do you know what the answer to this question ?
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
it &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
in other aspects of life that &apos;s very much more significant than buying these objects are the same explosion of choice .
health longer -- it &apos;s no longer the case in the united states that you go to the doctor and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , they go to the doctor and doctor says , we could make a or we could make b .
a has these benefits and risks .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
and they say , &quot; doctor , what do i do ? &quot;
the doctor says a has these benefits and risks and b has the benefits and risks .
what do you want to do ?
and if you say , &quot; if you were , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not . &quot;
the result is -- we call it &quot; patients autonomy . &quot; that sounds like a good thing , but in reality , it &apos;s a shift of responsibility for the meeting of someone who knows something -- namling the doctor .
there &apos;s an enormous marketing system for people like you and me , which , if you think about it , doesn &apos;t make sense at all , because we don &apos;t buy it .
why do they hire for us when we can &apos;t buy ?
the answer is : you expect to call up the doctor the next morning and ask to ask a change of the competition .
something so profound as our identity is now a question of choice , how to show this slide .
we don &apos;t get identity ; we invent it .
and we do so often new as we want .
that means that every day you wake up in the morning , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time in which the standard assumption was that almost everyone had one and that they were so fast , as they could , and then quickly get kids like they could .
the only choice was &quot; who , &quot; not when , and not what they did afterwards .
now everything is easy to have .
i teach you wonderful intelligent students , and i &apos;ll give you 20 percent less work than i did .
and that &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , and not because they &apos;re less carefully .
it &apos;s because you &apos;re busy with other things , you ask yourself , &quot; should i marry or not ? should i get married ?
should i marry later ? should i have kids , or do i have a career ? &quot;
these are all objections .
and they &apos;re going to answer these questions whether this means to make all the tasks that i &apos;m going to give you and not get a good note in my class .
and in fact , they should . these are important to answer questions .
work -- we &apos;re blessed to think of carl light , with technology that allows us to work every minute from every single day on the planet -- to the margins hotel .
and by the way , there &apos;s a corner that i &apos;m not going to tell you about , where it works .
i &apos;m not going to tell you , because i want to use it .
so what it means is that this incredible freedom of choice we have in terms of making decisions , again and again , whether we should work or not work .
we can see our children playing football , and we have our mobile phone on a hip , and our blackberry on other hip , and our laptop probably on our lap .
and even though they &apos;re all turned off , every minute we look at our child , we &apos;re also asking ourselves , &quot; should i accept this call ?
should i respond to this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
and even though the answer to the question , &quot; no , &quot; is it going to be your experience of your childhood game very different than it would have been .
everywhere we look , big things and small things , material things and lifestyle , life is a choice of choice .
and the world in which we lived looked like this .
so i want to say , there were some choices , but not all was a question of choice .
and the world we live in now looks like this .
and the question is , are the good news or bad news ?
the answer is &quot; yes . &quot;
we all know what &apos;s good about it , so i &apos;m going to talk about what &apos;s bad about it .
all these choices have two effects , two negative effects on people .
a key thing , paradoxically , is that he &apos;s going to get caught up .
so with so many options you can choose , people are very hard to decide at all .
i &apos;m going to give you another drastic example of this , a study about investment in volunteers .
a colleague of mine had access to investment records of vanley, the gigantic fondsociety of about a million employees and about 2,000 different jobs .
and what she found was a 10 investment fund that was the employer of labor , the participation of two percent .
they offer 50 investment fund -- 10 percent less employees than if they only offer five . why ?
because it &apos;s 50 investment fund that are available to choice , it &apos;s so hard to decide that they &apos;re going to push it up tomorrow .
and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , of course , it never comes .
you know , that &apos;s not just what people have to eat dog food , if they go into the retirement , because they don &apos;t have enough money to go on , it means they &apos;re missing a lot of investment in their workforce .
they don &apos;t give you up to 5,000 u.s. dollars a year from the workforce that would have been happy to replicate .
paralysis is a consequence of many choices .
and i think it makes the world look like this .
you want to make the decision really right , if it &apos;s for everybody , right ?
they don &apos;t want to choose the wrong investment fund , or even the wrong salatsis .
so this is the one effect . the other effect is that even if we overcome paralysis and make a decision , we end up getting less happy with the result of choice when we had the opportunity to decide between less possibilities .
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is , in fact , by the great selection of different salatdsings , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and , which is , you know , salatences is perfect ? it &apos;s easy to have a different choice , and what &apos;s happening is they can make a different choice , and what &apos;s happening is they have a different choice , and what &apos;s happening is they have a different choice .
the more possibilities there are , the more the easier it is to regret , that &apos;s disappointing to the choice that you meet .
secondly , what economists call oppertunic costs .
dan gilbert made a big deal today by telling how much the way we evaluate things depends on what we compare .
well , if there &apos;s a lot of alternative to remember , it &apos;s just more attractive to imagine the alternative of alternatives that they have less happy with the alternatives that they chose .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not new york , i apologize .
but here &apos;s what you should have thought .
here &apos;s a few on the hamptons .
very expensive real estate .
beautiful beach . great afternoon . you have it all for yourself .
what could be better ? &quot; the man thinks , &quot; it &apos;s august .
everyone in my manhattan is gone away .
i could park right in front of my house . &quot;
and he spends two weeks from the thought he &apos;s missing the possibility of having a great parking lot day .
oppercotance cost is lower happiness that we get through our choice , even if what we &apos;ve chosen is fantastic .
and the more opportunities there are to choice , the more attractive qualities of these choices are taking into the oppertunance cost .
here &apos;s another example .
well , this cartoon does some statements .
he makes a statement about it now and maybe to do things about it .
but one more important thing he does is : always who you choose for one thing , you don &apos;t choose to do other things .
and these other things may have a lot of attractive qualities , and it will be what they &apos;re going to do less .
third : aspen of expectations .
this struck me when i wanted to exchange my jeans .
i wear jeans , almost the whole time .
and there was a time in which there was only jeans a kind , and they bought them , and they bought bad , they were incredibly uncompetitive , and if they had a long enough bribe , they started to feel &quot; ok . &quot;
so to buy new jeans to many years of training , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have some jeans , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
and the salesesman said , &quot; do you want brike , light or special ?
do you want to wash the buttons or a silver one ? stone or acid ?
do you want jeans with holes ?
you &apos;d be cutting down the bottom , cookie , blah blah , blah , blah -- and so on .
my jaw was down , and after i went , i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have the way that we used to be the only way . &quot;
he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour trying to take all of these damn jeans jeans , and the business -- and i say the truth -- with the best passend that i ever had .
i had better . i allowed all these choices to make it better .
but i felt bad .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try and explain it to myself .
the reason that i felt worse felt with all these available possibilities , my expectations for what was a good pair of jeans , walking up .
i had very low expectations . i had no concrete expectations than there was only in a way .
when they came into 100 species , they were supposed to be perfect , one of them should have been perfect .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so i put what i had gotten to what i expected , and what i had was disappointing to what i expected .
this adds up from possibilities in people &apos;s lives inevitably increase the expectations of how good these are going to be .
and this leads to less happiness with the results , even though the results are good .
no one in the marketing world knows this , because if you would , you all know what it &apos;s about .
the truth is more like this .
the reason is , that used to be better than anything that was worse than anything worse , it was possible for the people who had a pleasant surprise .
now , in the world that we live in -- we &apos;re wealthy , industrialized citizens , with perfect intervention as an expectation -- the best for you can hope to be as well as you expect it .
they &apos;re never surprised because their expectations , my expectations , are high .
the secret to happiness -- that &apos;s what you &apos;ve all got -- the secret to happiness is low expectations .
i want to say -- a short of an autobiographical moment -- that i &apos;m married with a woman , and she &apos;s really wonderful .
i couldn &apos;t have done it better . i didn &apos;t dismiss myself .
but rainfall is not always a bad thing .
finally , a consequence of buying a bad seats when there &apos;s only one way to buy that if you &apos;re unsatisfied , and you wonder why , who is responsible , the answer is responsible . what could you have done ?
if hundreds of different types of jeans are available , and you buy the disappointing , and you ask why , who is responsible ?
is it clear that the answer to the question is : you .
they could have done it better .
with 100 different types of jeans in the window , there &apos;s no excuse for mistakes .
and so , when people make decisions , and even when the results of the decisions are good , they feel disappointed about themselves .
clinical depression exploded in the industrial world in the last generation .
i think a significant thing -- not the only , but a significant bite to this explosion of depression , and also suicide , is that people have learned the disappointing because their standards have to explain because their standards are so high , and then if they have to explain these experiences themselves , it would be their fault .
and so the visual result is that it &apos;s generally better to us , objective , and we feel worse .
so let me remind you .
this is the official dogma that we all hold for right , completely wrong . it &apos;s not true .
there &apos;s no question that &apos;s a little bit better than not , but it doesn &apos;t follow that more choice than something .
there &apos;s a magical set . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we &apos;ve missed this point for a long time on the selection of our public good .
now , as a rule of policy -- i &apos;m almost done -- when a rule question , the thing about thinking about this is , what all of these choices allow in the developed societies , is the material wealth .
there are lots of places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard of many of them , whose problem is not too big .
your problem is that you have too little .
so the things that i &apos;m talking about are a strange problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what &apos;s so frustrating , and it is , steve levitt has told you yesterday about how these expensive and hard to green car seats don &apos;t help . it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy to help it .
they even hurt .
you worry about it that we are bad for .
if something of the people in our society make decisions such decisions to the societies in which people would have too little choice , it would not just improve the lives of the people , but our dignity will be improved .
economists call this a pareto-improved application .
income distribution is going to be concerned that it &apos;s all better -- not just the poor -- because all of these big choices give us comfort .
finally , read this cartoon , and , you know , a highly developed person , says , &quot; ah ! what does this fish know ?
they don &apos;t know anything in this gold fish glass . &quot;
the imagination , a short-held view of the world -- and that the way i first read it .
the more i thought about it , the more i got to the point of view of the fish .
because the truth is that when you break the gold glass glass , everything is possible , you have no freedom . you have paralysis .
if you break the gold glass glass , it &apos;s all possible to lower happiness .
they increase the paralysis and lower happiness .
everyone needs a gold glass glass .
this is almost limited to limited security -- potentially for the fish , definitely for us .
but it &apos;s a recipe by a metaphorical gold jar glass glass , which is a recipe for misery , and , i guess , disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects before , about the human genome , and what that might mean , and the discovery of new groups of genes .
in fact , we &apos;re starting from a new point : we &apos;ve digitized biology , and now we &apos;re trying to get from the digital code into a new phase of biology by designing new lives and building .
we &apos;ve always tried to ask major questions .
what &apos;s life ? it &apos;s something i believe a lot of biologists have tried to understand and that on different levels .
we &apos;ve tried different ways to simplify it to the minimum components .
we &apos;ve actually digitized 20 years . when we sequenced the human genome , we &apos;ve sequenced the change from the analog world of biology to the digital world .
now , let &apos;s try to ask whether we can regenerate life or whether we can create new lives from this digital universe ?
this is the map of a small organism , mycoplasma gtaliban , who has the smallest genome of a species that can replicate itself in the lab , and we &apos;ve tried to do that with a smaller genome .
we &apos;ve done it in about a hundred genes of the 500 or something like this .
but if we look at these metabolic map , which is very simple , compared to our . trust me , that &apos;s easy , but if we look at all these genes we can eliminate one after the other , it &apos;s very unlikely to lead to a living cell .
so we decided that it &apos;s the only way to go forward this chromosome , which allows us to vary the individual components and ask some of these fundamental questions .
and so we started with the question , can we draw a chromosome ?
does it allow the chemistry to make these really large molecules that have never been done before ?
and , if we can do that , can we launch the chromosome ?
a chromosome is by the way , by the way , a piece of inert chemical material .
our steps in life are exponentially .
our ability to write genetic code has been evolving very slowly but nevertheless , and our last point would be on an exponential curve .
we started 15 years ago .
it actually took a few years to start with a bioethical review before we did the first experiments .
it turns out that dna synthetic is very difficult .
there are tens of thousands of machines to make the world that can make small pieces of dna , 30 to 50 letters long , but it &apos;s a deinduced process , so the longer you make a piece , the more mistake happens .
so we had to develop a new way of putting these little pieces together and recorrect the mistakes .
this was our first attempt , starting with the digital information , the genome phi x 174 .
it &apos;s a little virus killing bacteria .
we made small pieces , made a error correction , and we had a dna molecule from about 5,000 letters .
the exciting phase came when we took this piece of inert chemical and put it into a bacterium , and the bacteria started reading the genetic code and made viral particles .
the viral particles were then released by the cells and came back and killed e. coli .
recently , i talked to the oil industry , and they said they had this model right now .
they laughed more than her here .
so we think that this is a situation in which software can actually build its hardware in a biological system .
but we wanted to go much further . we wanted to build a whole bacterium chromosome . it has more than 580,000 letters genetic code . so we thought we could build it in cassees from the size of a living cell to understand what is the size of a living cell .
design is the key , and if you want to start with digital information in the computer , this digital information really needs to be error .
when we first sequenced the genome in 1995 , the error rate in a mistake was 10,000 bases .
we found out at the age of 30 mistakes , and if we had used the original sequence , it would never have been possible .
part of the design is to create pieces that have to be the 50 letters long , and the other with other 50-letter have to split up to build smaller sub-units to build smaller sub-units that fit together .
we have unique elements here .
you may have heard that we built watermarks .
think about it : we have a fourth letter code : a , c , g and t .
triplets of this letter -- these letters encode about 20 amino acids , and there &apos;s a single purpose for each of these amino acids .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , sentences , thoughts .
we first signed ourselves .
some people were disappointed that it was no poetry .
we &apos;ve constructed the pieces that we could just dissect them with enzymes , and there are enzymes that repair these and put them together .
and we started to create pieces , starting with bits of pieces , the fifth to seven characters , and to make these two together pieces of each other in order to bring them together until 72,000 .
in every step we produced these pieces in overscale , so we could sequence them because we tried to create a very robust process what they &apos;re going to see in a minute .
we tried to get to the point of automation .
so , this looks like a basketball playoff .
if we get to these really big pieces -- over 100,000 bases pairs -- they don &apos;t just grow into e. coli . it goes up all the possibilities of modern molecular biology , and so we set up other mechanisms .
we knew about a mechanism of homologist called homeologist , which uses biology to repair dna that can put together these pieces together .
here &apos;s an example of it . there &apos;s an organism called deinococcus radioduran , of radiation .
you see in the upper field that its chromosome just falls apart .
12 to 24 hours later , everything would put together as it was .
we have thousands of organisms that can do this .
these organisms can be completely dry , they can even live in a vacuum .
i &apos;m absolutely sure life exists in space and can move , looking for aquatic conditions .
in fact , nasa has shown that there &apos;s a lot of it out there .
here &apos;s a cuge-up of the molecule that we &apos;ve created by using these processes -- actually , we &apos;ve used hefe-mechanisms with the right design of the pieces we have . yeast put it automatically together .
this is not a electron microscope recording it &apos;s a regular microscopic recording .
it &apos;s such a big molecule that we can even see it with the light microscope .
these are photographs of six seconds .
that &apos;s the publication we &apos;ve just done recently .
these are over 580,000 letters on genetic code . it &apos;s the largest molecule that has ever been created by the people .
it has a molecular weight of over 300 million .
if we would print it with a piece of a piece of 10 and without the bottom , it would put 142 pages , just to print this genetic code .
now , how do we start a chromosome ? how do we activate it ?
obviously , it &apos;s a very simple virus . it &apos;s much more complicated to deal with bacteria .
it &apos;s also easier if you &apos;re in eukaryons like we are , you just take out the nucleus out and there &apos;s another one in it , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;ve all heard about cloning .
archaebacteria is the chromosome in the cell , but recently we &apos;ve shown that you can do a full transplant of a chromosome from a cell to another , and that activates .
we clean up the chromosome of a microspecies species , and roughly said these two as well as humans and mice . we gave some extra genes to pick up this chromosome , and it was very amazing as we put it in a cell -- and it was very amazing as we put it in a cell -- and it was very amazing as we put it in a cell .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
in fact , we thought that this is the end , but we &apos;ve tried to bring the process a little bit further .
this is the main mechanism of evolution here .
we find all kinds of species here that have a second chromosome , or a third of some , thousands of characteristics , every time in just a second .
so people who think of evolution as a gene that &apos;s changed at a time is a lot of the biology .
there are enzymes that are called restriction , which are actually called the restriction of dna .
the chromosome that was in the cell has no one ; the chromosomes we &apos;ve added .
it became exemed in the cell , and recognized the other chromosome as a foreign material , and so we ended up with one cell with a new chromosome .
it turned out to be blue because of the genes we added .
and after a very short period of time , all of the characteristics had lost the species of the species and completely in a new species based on the new species that we put into the cell .
all the proteins changed the membranes -- when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we have transgenerated .
it may sound like genomic alchimia , but we can , by moving the software dna , things quite dramatic .
now i argued that this is not the israelis -- that &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years of evolution .
and i have argued that we might be able to create a new form of the camel explosion in which there might be massive new species of species based on this digital design .
why should we do that ?
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious about what we need .
we are six and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
to put it in my context , i was born in 1946 .
today three people on this planet are in 1946 ; within 40 years , it will be four .
we have problems with food , with fresh and clean water , medicine , fuel for 6.5 billion people .
it &apos;s going to offer a challenge for nine .
we need about five billion tons of coal , 30-plus billions of barrels of oil , which are a hundred million barrels a day .
if we think about biological processes or any process to replace it , it becomes a huge challenge .
then , of course , there is the whole co2 of this material in the atmosphere .
we have now , from our discoveries around the world , a database of about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the design components of the future .
the electric flu industry had a dozen components and look at the diversity of it .
this is first line to the limits of biological reality and on those of our imagination .
we have technologies today because of this rapid amputation methods to do what we call combined genetics .
we now have the opportunity to build a large robot that can make millions of chromosomes a day .
if you think about making these 20 million different genes , or to optimize these processes to create oces , or to produce drugs new vaccines , we can change more molecular biology than the last 20 years .
and it &apos;s only just selection selection . we can select for life , production of chemicals or fuel production , and so on .
this is a picture of active design that we &apos;re working on with the fact that you &apos;re actually designing and designing new species on the computer .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know how it looks . we know exactly how their genetic code is going to look .
we &apos;re now focusing on the fourth generation of the fourth generation .
you &apos;ve seen corn recently , which is just a bad experiment .
we have the two-generation of the two-generation and third generation that will come out of a much higher amount of sugar , like oces or different kinds of butans .
but , as we think , the only way that biology is going to have a huge impact without any other increase of the cost of food , or the dispulsion of their availability , is when we see co2 as the initial material , and that &apos;s why we &apos;re working on cells .
and we think we will be the first generation of the fourth generation , and that &apos;s about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
but in our discovery of the world , we have all kinds of different ways .
this is an organism we described 1996 .
he lives in the deep sea , about a and a half miles deep , in almost cooking water temperatures .
it runs co2 in methane by using hydrogen as a source of energy .
we study whether we can use co2 , which could just be used to production , convertate co2 in fuel to make this process .
in a short period of time , we think we could be able to solve one of the fundamental questions of life .
you know , we really -- moderate targets like substitting the entire petrochemical industry . right . if you couldn &apos;t do that at ted , where else ? a major source of energy .
but at the moment , we &apos;re working on using the same approaches for the developing vaccine .
they &apos;ve seen it this year with the flu , we &apos;re always a year back in the back , and we have a dollar to see the right vaccine .
and i think that can be changed by building the recurring vaccines in the first place .
this is what the future might look like with changes , can be accelerated today , with synthetic bacteria , archaen , and perhaps eukaryons .
we &apos;re a little bit better for improving people . our goal is that we have a chance to survive long enough to possibly do that . thank you very much .
on the last ted conference , i gave an introduction to the lhc .
and i promised to come back to explain how the machine works .
so , as far as it is , and for all those who weren &apos;t there , the lhc is the biggest scientific experiment ever ever looked at -- 27 miles in diameter .
his job is to create the conditions that exist less than a billionth of a second after the universe -- and to 600 million times within a second .
it &apos;s just breath-ambitious .
this is the machine underneath gene .
we take images of this mini big big , all in detectors .
this is what i &apos;m doing . he &apos;s called the atlas detector -- 44 meters in the width , 22 meters in diameter .
here &apos;s a spectacular picture of the atlas in order to see the scale .
on september 10 last year , the machine went to the first time .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
it caused huge arrangements in the control room .
it &apos;s a picture of radiation , which is the entire distance to bring back the lhc , then to be part of the lhc , to make a rain of particles on the detector .
in other words , when we saw this picture at september 10 , we knew that the machine works , which is a great triumph .
i don &apos;t know if this created the biggest juaters , or that , as someone visited the google page and found the front page .
it means we reached a cultural impact next to the scientific .
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine to do that with these wires here -- this golden wires here .
these wires run 13-thousand ampons when the machine runs on high-performance .
now , the engineers under you are going to look at them and say , &quot; no , don &apos;t do that . that &apos;s little wires . &quot;
you can afford that because if you &apos;re very cool , you &apos;re going to become something called superconductors .
so in minus 271 degrees , as the space between the stars , these wires can produce the tension .
in one of the connections , between nine thousand magnets in the lhc , there was a manlot defect .
and by using these wires , the wires tend to have lower and 1,000 thousand ampons , suddenly .
this was the result .
now , all of this is more amazing when you imagine that the magnets weigh over 20 tons , and around 30 inches .
so we damaged about 50 of the magnet .
and they had to remove what we did .
we repaired them , repair them .
they &apos;re all back on their way back .
at the end of march , the lhc will be functional again .
we &apos;re going to get rid of it , and we expect to collect first data in june or july , and we continue to get our journey to find out what blocks of the universe are .
well , of course , on a kind of defold accidents , again , the debate of science and engineering in such boundaries . it &apos;s easy to reject it .
i think the fact that it &apos;s so hard to get the fact that we reach beyond our limitations , the value of things like the lhc .
i &apos;m going to leave my final words to a english scientist . bumblephrey davy , who , as i suspect , is when he defended the use of his teaching experiments of his teaching , his teaching was michael faraday , which said , &quot; nothing is so dangerous for the development of human spirit , &quot; which said , &quot; nothing is so dangerous for development of human mind . &quot;
thank you .
i &apos;m a writer .
writing books is my job , but it &apos;s more than that .
it &apos;s also my big , life-long love and fascination .
and i don &apos;t expect that ever to change .
however , shorter is something like this in my life , and my career has occurred to me to rethink my relationship with this work .
this particular event was that i was writing a book recently -- a biography called axiy , florkin , florc -- that decided , unlike all my previous books in the world , and a big mega-, international seller thing .
the result is that i don &apos;t care where i &apos;m going to be treated as if i &apos;m the set .
seriously -- the faked !
for example , are you very worried about me and say , &quot; don &apos;t you fear that you &apos;re never going to meet this success ?
do you have no fear that you write your whole life and you never create a book that &apos;s interested in anyone in the world ?
okay , that really makes sense .
however , it would be worse if i didn &apos;t remember that i was about 20 years ago when i was a teenager for the first time that i wanted to be a writer with the same kind of fear response .
people said , &quot; do you fear not to succeed ? &quot;
do you have no fear that the humiliation of telling you ?
do you have no fear that you &apos;re going to go to your life for your life and never get something out of it , and you &apos;re never going to have something that you &apos;re going to die , and you &apos;re going to be dead -- your mouth filled with the bitter marches of failure ?
so , you know , you know .
the answer -- the short answer to all these questions is : multi-touch .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
and i always had .
and i fear a lot more stuff that no one would ever get .
like algae -- and other fearless things .
but , when it comes to writing , i &apos;ve been thinking about it recently , and i ask myself , why ?
is that sensible ?
is it logical that someone should be afraid that he &apos;s afraid to do the work he feels ?
and what &apos;s wrong with the creative enterprise that they make us secure about the mutual humanality -- in a way that other professions don &apos;t do ?
my father , for example , was chemists and i can &apos;t remember the situation in his 40 years as a chemist that he was asked to be afraid .
with your chemist block , john -- how do you do it ?
it just wasn &apos;t , you know ?
but to be fair -- the group of chemists didn &apos;t get the reputation of alcocide addicts to people .
we authors seem to have this kind of call , but not only the writers , but the creative of all genres , seem to have this reputation , mentally unstable .
all you need to do is look at the bitter death rates of really great leaders of the 20th century , which died young and often from their own .
and even those who didn &apos;t actually get suicide seemed to be neglected by their talfors .
norman maskrly said to his death in his last interview : achilles each of my books killed me a little bit further .
an extraordinary statement that you can do about your life work .
but we don &apos;t even notice if we &apos;re going to hear somebody like this , because we &apos;ve known this kind of talk for so long ago , and somehow we have the idea of internzing creativity and collective accepted that creativity and suffering , of course , is coming together .
the question i want to ask today is , is this idea for you completely in order ?
you might feel about it ? because you just look at one centimeter -- i &apos;m not comfortable with this notion at all .
i love them .
and i find them dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to watch how she &apos;s going to take over the next century .
i find it better if we encourage our big creative to live .
and i definitely know that for me , it was -- in my situation -- very dangerous , to start , this dark path of the guess of the mind -- especially in the fact that i just found myself in my career .
that means -- i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m just about 40 years old .
i may have another 40 years of labor .
and it &apos;s quite likely that everything i &apos;m going to write about the world as the work is being applied by the work of my last book , right ?
i &apos;m going straight , because we &apos;re all kind of friends now -- it &apos;s highly likely that my biggest success is behind me .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
that &apos;s the kind of thought that someone can get to start at 9 o &apos;clock in the morning , and i don &apos;t want to .
i would continue to do this work that i love .
so the question is : how ?
after some time of the reflection , i seem to be able to write that i continue to write , a way of living psychological construct .
i somehow have to find a way to find a safe distance between me and my very natural distance about how the reaction will be on the written .
while i &apos;ve been looking for models in the last year to do this , i &apos;ve been looking in the past , and i &apos;ve tried to find other societies to see if they might have had better or rational ideas to deal with the emotional risks associated with creativity .
this quest led me to the old greece and the old rome .
please follow me , because the circle will end again .
but in the old greece and rome , people didn &apos;t believe that creativity comes from people , ok ?
they believed that creativity was a kind of divine word , which comes from a distant , unknown source to the people -- from unproven , unknown reasons .
the greeks called these divine dicters of creativity representatives .
socrates is known that he believed he would have had a chair that refused him to stay away from himself .
the roman , the same idea , they called this kind of body loin-creative mind .
this is great . the roman thought didn &apos;t really think a genius was a particularly mild individual .
they believed that a genius was this kind of magical divine creature , which was believed that it literally lives in the walls of an artist studio -- about such as dobby , the janital -- that would come out and make the work invisible in the work of work .
this is brilliant -- there it is , there &apos;s the distance that i talked about -- the psychological construction , which will protect you from the consequences of your work .
and everyone knew that it worked , right ?
the artist &apos;s artist was protected by some things , like , for example , too much narcisisism , right ?
if your work was brilliant , you didn &apos;t look at everything for you . everybody knew you had this body genius that helped you .
if your work went off -- not entirely your fault , right ?
everyone knew your genius was something laughing .
this is how people really thought about creativity in the west for a long time .
and then the renaissance and everything changed . we had this big idea , and this big idea was : let &apos;s take the human individual into the center of the universe -- about all gods and mystery , and there &apos;s no longer room for mystical creatures who are blogging .
it &apos;s the beginning of rational human society , and people started believing that creativity came completely from their own individual .
for the first time in history , people are listening to this , or those artists , a genius -- instead of having a genius .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
you know ? i think to allow one person to think he &apos;s thinking , or she &apos;s like the gourd , how the basin and the essence and the source and the source and the source and the source and the source of all divine , creative , unfamiliar , is a little bit of responsibility .
it &apos;s like asking someone to swallow the sun .
and that turns out to be distorted , and it creates all these unaccessible expectations of success .
i think that this success has killed our artists of the last 500 years .
and , if that &apos;s true , and i think it &apos;s true -- is the question .
can we change it ?
maybe to return to an aging understanding of the relationship between people and mystery of creative .
maybe not .
maybe we can &apos;t get the thought good from 500 years of rationism in a 10-minute talk .
and there is certainly people in this audience who would really get out of scientific doubt about the idea of -- basically -- feen , people follow and feeny magic on their projects and so on .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey .
but the question i want to throw up is , why not ?
why not think about it ?
because it makes it as much sense as anything else that i &apos;ve heard about when it comes to explaining the absolutely crazy capenism of the creative process .
a process that -- like everyone knows , who has ever tried to do something -- so in other words , in other words , everyone here -- not always behaved .
in fact , he can feel quite parformtimes .
i had a particular encounter recently as i met the extraordinary american ditasess in ruth stone , which is now about 90 , but all of their life for the long time , and she told me that she was growing up in the back of the village , and she said she could feel like a poem about the landscape on her .
she would say it would be like a jet train .
it would roll over the country .
she felt , if it came , because it would take the earth under their feet .
she knew that she was just able to do one in such a moment , and that was -- in their words -- intel run like the devil .
they ran like the devil for the house as they were tracked by this poem , and it wasn &apos;t that they had to get fast enough to a sheet of paper and a pen to get it through , and put it on the sheet .
in other paint , she wasn &apos;t very fast enough . they ran and ran and ran , but she didn &apos;t get the house and the poem rolling through her and she sent it . she would go back to the country , she would put it on the country , she would move it on . she would go on to the country .
and then there were these moments -- the part , i &apos;m never going to forget -- she said that there were moments that they would almost put it .
so , she goes to the house , and she &apos;s looking for the paper , and the poem goes through her and she picks up a pen as she goes through and then she goes through and then they get -- she said , &quot; it was as if with your other hand . &quot;
she got the poem on his tail and he took it back into her body and took it to the paper .
in those opportunities , the poem came in and intact in the paper -- but backwards -- from the last word to the first .
when i heard that , i thought , &quot; well , i &apos;m going to do this kind of weird -- that &apos;s exactly how my creative process is happening . &quot;
that &apos;s not like my creative process -- i &apos;m not the channel !
i &apos;m a moue . to work at the same time , i have to get up to the same time every day and i &apos;m really uncomfortable .
but even i put this thing out in my mouth sometimes .
and i guess many of you have done that too .
even i had work or ideas that came from a source i really couldn &apos;t identify .
what is that thing ?
and how do we get in relation to losing our minds without losing our minds , but even at the contrary to the intellectual health ?
for me , the best living example of how to create this is the musicians tom waits . i had to interview him a magazine for a magazine .
we talked about this issue , and you know what ? most of his life , tom was the embodiment of the dreembarrassing modern artist , who tried to ban these uncontrolled creative impulses that were going in them and with them .
but then he became older and quiet . he told me that one day he went to los angeles in los angeles , and it all changed for him .
he &apos;s going at high speed as he suddenly hears a little fragment of a tune , which is what inspiration often is for him , and it &apos;s very difficult for him , and he wants to have it . it &apos;s fluid . it can &apos;t touch it .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a pen , he &apos;s got a license of tape .
so he starts to get these old beclipration in him , such as i &apos;m going to lose this thing and will be rejected by this song forever .
i &apos;m not good enough , i don &apos;t make it .
but instead of getting stuck , he just stopped .
he finished all the time and he did something completely new .
he just looked into the sky , and he said , &quot; achilles , can &apos;t you see that i drive ? &quot;
prospi look like i could just write a song ?
if you really want to exist , come back to a cheap moment , if i can take care of you .
if you don &apos;t , you have somebody else .
go and qudy leonard cohen .
his whole process has changed .
not the work itself . that was often so dark , as ever as ever .
but the process and the heavy deal that surrounds him was that he took the genius out of where he did nothing in trouble and left him back to where he came from . he realized it had to be no internzing , agonized thing .
it could give you a owners , miraculous , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and foreign , face thing that wasn &apos;t quite tom .
as i heard this story , it also changed a little bit of the way i worked and i &apos;ve already saved it .
and this idea saved me as i was in the middle of the writing process of abc food , abc , love , and i fell in one of those blods of the two rock that we all fall in when we work on something and not work . you start thinking that it &apos;s going to be a disaster .
not just bad , but the worst of all time .
i started thinking , i should just put the project out .
but then i remembered how tom was talking about the sky , and i tried it .
so i took my gaze from the manuscript and i spoke to the comment towards an empty corner of the room .
i was talking loudly , you know , you and i and i both know when this book isn &apos;t brilliant , that it &apos;s not entirely my fault , right ?
because you see that i have everything i have , investment . i don &apos;t have more than that .
so if you want to have it better , you &apos;ve got to check up here and think of your share .
okay . but if you don &apos;t do that -- you know what , then the hell .
i &apos;m still going to write , because that &apos;s my job .
and i want to give to sculpture that i was here today for my part of the jobs .
because -- at the end of it , it &apos;s like follows . centuries ago , in the deserts of north africa , people in the deserts of north africa and music collects with sacred dancers and music for hours .
these strong were always great , because the dancers were professional and they were fantastic .
but again , very rare , something special happened . one of the darker was actually overdeveloped .
and i know you know what i mean , because i know that you &apos;ve all seen a performance in your life .
it was over time , and the dancer was walking through a kind of pame , and he didn &apos;t do anything different than he did -- 1,000 nights before . but all put together .
and all of a sudden , he didn &apos;t get more human .
he was illuminated by the inside , and it lit up , and everything lit through a divine fire .
when something happened then , people knew what this was . they called it in his name .
they put hands together , and they started singing : chloroplah , allah , allah , god , god , god .
this is god , you know ?
interesting historic footsteps : when the moar of the spain took place , they brought it to this one . the language changed over the centuries of chloroplah , alé , olé cad , olé , olé , and you &apos;re still listening to them and flencots .
if a darker in spain has a little inability to do something magic : couchlah , olé , olé , allah , alvo loops , because it &apos;s a glimpse of god .
and that &apos;s great , because we need it .
but , the tricky part follows the morning , when the dancers wake up , and recognizes that it &apos;s 11 o &apos;clock on a tuesday -- and it &apos;s no longer a fifth of god .
he &apos;s just an aging outbreak of pain , and maybe he will never get back to these heights .
and maybe someone &apos;s calling god &apos;s name , if he turns . but what is he to do with the rest of his life ?
that &apos;s hard .
this is one of the most painful correctness of a creative life .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so full of pa if you didn &apos;t believe that the most extraordinary aspects of your existence come from .
if you believe that you &apos;re a body , you &apos;re a body -- from an unimaginable source of your life , which is passed on somebody else when you &apos;re done with it .
when we start thinking about it , it changes everything .
so i started thinking , and i think about security in the last few months , while i was working on the book , which is soon going to appear -- when the dangerous , frightening , much anticipated , much of the expected success .
what i have to say to myself is , if i &apos;m crazy about it , i have no fear .
not disapled .
just do your job .
be still for your contribution , whatever it is .
if your job is dancing , it &apos;s dance .
if the stupid divine genius you put on the side is , you decide , for a brief moment , you &apos;re going to get a miracle of wonder through your effort to show , then declolé ! wisconsin .
and if not , it &apos;s your dance .
and moreolé ! wisconsin for you despite that .
i believe , and i feel like we should teach this .
moreolé ! wisconsin for you despite this , just that you have the mere human love and the sense of being there .
thank you .
thank you .
olé !
last year , i &apos;ve shown these two slides to illustrate that the arctic ice agency , for nearly three million years , had the size of the lower 48 states in order to have 40 percent .
but this doesn &apos;t push very much enough the seriousness of this particular problem , because it doesn &apos;t show the thickness of the ice .
in a certain sense , the arctic ice app is the beating heart of our global climate system .
it grows in winter and shrinking in the summer .
the next slide i &apos;m showing you is a time-lapse view of what &apos;s happened in the last 25 years .
the permanent ice is covered with red .
as you can see , it &apos;s growing on the dark blue . this is the annual ice in winter ; it &apos;s shrinking in summer .
that so-called permanent ice , five years old or older , is almost like blood , which is going out from the body here .
in 25 years it will be disappeared by here .
this is a problem , because the warming causes the frozen bottom of the arctic ocean , in which there are great amounts of frozen carbon , which , when it comes up , of microbes to methane .
compared to the entire amount of climate change in the atmosphere , it could double that amount if we cross this critical point .
already today , in some flat lakes in alaska methane , methane is from itself from the water .
professor katey walter &apos;s university in alaska traveled to another set of labor in the last winter last winter .
wow !
you &apos;re going to do it well . the question is , what will we do ?
and one reason is , this enormous heat is warm greenland from the north .
this is a annual water river .
but volume are much bigger than ever before .
this is the canary in southern west river in southern west .
if you want to know how the sea level rises through land ice , it goes down into the ocean .
these rivers take rapid .
on the other end of the planet , antarctica , the biggest ice mass on the planet .
last month , researchers announced that the entire continent now has a negative ice balance .
and the west antarctica showed up about a few underwater islands is particularly in the melting .
this is 20 feet sea size , like greenland .
in the himalayas , the third largest iceberg , you see up the top of new lakes that were glaciers a few years ago .
40 percent of all the people in the world get half of their drink of water from this melting water .
in the animc , this glacier is the firing water source for this city .
water rates have increased .
but if they fly , most of the water will fall away .
in california , there was a 40 percent reduction in the cockroach of the sierra .
this is the memory basin .
and the predictions of how they read them are serious .
this austrocky in the world leads to a dramatic increase of fire .
and the disasters all over the world have , in a really extraordinary and unprecedented and unprecedented amount of magnitude .
four times over the last 30 years , like in the previous 75 years .
this is a completely incomplete pattern pattern .
if you look at this in the historical context , you can see what it does .
in the last five years , we &apos;ve created 70 million tons of co2 all over the last five hours -- 25 million tons every day in the oceans .
look at the eastern pacific area right now , from the american continent of west , and both of the indian subcontinents of the indian subcontinent , where there &apos;s a drastic decline in the ocean .
the biggest single factor for global warming , besides deforestation , which is 20 percent , is burning from fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the largest problem .
the united states is one of the two largest polluutes , together with china .
and the proposal was to build many more coal factories .
but we begin to see a change .
here are the ones who were reviewed over the last few years , with some green alternatives that were proposed .
meanwhile , there &apos;s a political argument in our country .
and the cohlsistrias and the o70s have spent a quarter of a billion dollars last year to put clean coal , which is already a contradiction in itself .
this picture reminded me of something .
around christmas , i went home at home in tennessee , a billion tons of cooking .
you &apos;ve seen it wrong in the news .
this is in our country &apos;s second largest waste river .
this was happening for christmas .
one of the commercials of cooking industry was the christmas one .
frosty the carbon is a pleasure , happy burker .
it &apos;s in the skin and abundance in america , and it helps to grow our economy .
frosty , the carbon is clean every day .
it &apos;s affordable and loving , and workers stay in lohn and bread .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
the most powerful mountain worker is the director of massey charcoal .
let me say a very clear one . al gore , nancy fliosi , harry vd , you know what you &apos;re talking about .
so the alliance for climate protection has called two campaigns into life .
this is one part of her .
at coalergy , we see climate change as a serious threat to our business .
so we put it to the top time , spending a significant amount of money to bring a commercial action on the path to get the truth over coal .
the fact is , coal is not dirty .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it also smells good .
so , don &apos;t worry about the climate change .
leave that to us .
soeber coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
so let &apos;s make a tour of this modern , clean coal factory .
fantastic ! this machine is quite noisy .
but it &apos;s the sound of the clean coal technology .
and yet the burning of coal is one of the main reasons for global warming , which is remarkable , clean coal technology that you see here .
look at it precisely , this is the one today , clean coal technology .
finally , the positive alternative with our economic challenges and our challenge of national security .
america is in a crisis , the economy , national security , the climate crisis .
the red thread , which connects these all together , is our dependence on carbon based on the carbon power of dirty coal and foreign oil .
but now there &apos;s a bold new solution to get us out of this miserable situation .
care of america with 100 percent cleaner electricity , within the next 10 years .
a plan , america to work back to work , to make us safer and help stop global warming .
finally , a solution that &apos;s big enough to solve our problems .
care of america . find more .
this is the last one .
it &apos;s a new way of america .
one of the fastest ways , our dependence from old , dirty power , which are killing our world .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
new investments to create good paid jobs .
care of america . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
there &apos;s an old african adage : &quot; if you want to be quick alone .
if you want to come far , go together . &quot;
we have to come far , quickly .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to start by asking you to get back to the time of your childhood , when you were playing with a blueprint .
while they realized how to cut out the hands and grab it , it would take the blade and move it , and actually , you know , thinking about understanding and changing space .
spatial thinking is closely related to how we understand a lot of our environment .
as a computer scientist , inspired by the way of our interaction with real objects -- along with my peers and my colleagues , jeevan kalanithi , i started to wonder : what if we could use computers that move like a digital fingertarget , that could move like a digital fingertarget , which would be moving like this ? what if we could use the computers that move like this ?
and the question was that we decided to study the answer and the siders developed .
in short , a sider is an interactive computer in the size of a cookie .
you can be moved with your hand , you can see each other , you can detect your movements and you have a screen and you have a radio receiver .
much more importantly , are physically physically , why you can only move them like build-out through the hands of hands and access .
and the siders are an example of a new generation of aid for manipulation digital data .
and if these tools are being created , and a conscious awareness for their movements , they recognize each other , and the enemies of our struggle with them , we can begin to study new and entertaining interaction .
i start with some simple examples .
this sider is refiguring for the video project , and when i &apos;m in a direction , the video will run forward ; when i go to the other direction , it goes backwards .
and this interactive portraits is going to be true .
so if i put them side-by-side , they feel their interest .
if you &apos;re in a straight place , you &apos;ll notice that and you can get something nervous .
and they &apos;re also feeling their movements and demand .
an interesting consequence of the interactions that we started to recognize was that we could apply ordinary gestures to data , like colors like this , as you do with fluid .
in this case , we have three siders as a coloring configurigraphy , and i can use it to pour color in the middle of the middle , where they &apos;re going to mix .
if we overtake it , we can go back a little bit .
there are also some nice opportunities in education as well as languages , or math games , where we give people the opportunity of fast trial and want to see the results immediately .
here i am -- this is a fibonacci number that i have with a very simple program .
this is a game with words , which is a kind of mixture of scrabble and boggle .
basically , you can get every single round of the sigrable random letters , and as you try to form words , you &apos;re going to be tested by a dictionary .
then , after about 30 seconds , again , the mixed and you have a new kind of letter and new possibilities .
thank you .
these are some kids who come on a trip to the media lab , and i could move them to try and take a video of it .
they really loved it .
an interesting thing about this kind of applications is that you don &apos;t have to give people many instructions .
all you have to say is , &quot; make words &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
here &apos;s another couple of people who test it .
this is our youngest oldest down there on the right .
it turned out he was just wanting to stack the sives .
so , for him , they were just a blueprint .
this is an interactive composition .
we wanted to develop learning for language learning .
this is felix .
he can bring new characters into the scene by catching the sider from the table that shows this character .
here he goes to the sun .
the sun goes up .
now he gets a tractor in the scene .
the orange tractor .
good job ! yeah !
by shaking the siders , and she can put it next to the characters ...
... his own story .
hello !
it &apos;s a story with open end and it can decide how they evolve .
flying cat .
the last example that i &apos;ve been doing today , to show it is a musical sequence app for living data that we &apos;ve developed recently , and in the siwers as sound as sound , bass and stuff .
each has four different variations ; you can select what you want to use .
and you can put these notes into the sequence that you can again put into any patterns .
and you put them in the way that you just hold a piece of sound to a sequence of siinable .
there are effects that you can change live , like hall and filters .
you connect it with a certain tone and tends to hire it .
and then obese effects like speed and volume that you use on the whole sequence .
so let &apos;s see .
we &apos;re starting to feed the leadership in two scales , and that in a row , they expand and add a little more of the voice .
now i add a bass .
now i &apos;m going to do something about it .
and now i &apos;m commitment to the filter with the gear so i can control the effect live .
i can accelerate the whole sequence by drawing the pace into one or another direction .
and now i &apos;m commitment to the filter with the bass for something more .
i can put the sequence up while you &apos;re going .
so i don &apos;t have to plan them in front of the field , but can improvise ; they &apos;re at the same time .
and finally , i can swallow the whole sequence by breaking the sound of strength to the left .
thank you .
so , as you can see , my desire is to develop new human-computer computer , which is better to fit how our brains and bodies work .
and today i had time to give you a part of this new design world and some of the possibilities of what we &apos;re working on in our lab .
the idea that i want to leave you with in the way is that we are at the threshold to this new generation of value recognition with digital media , bringing information into our world , which is our demands .
thank you .
i &apos;m looking at the conversation with you all .
yeah , good afternoon .
i &apos;m glad i &apos;m there .
yeah , so what should be biohacking ?
i just have to take a little bit out of it , and that is biohacking with the modern molecular biology .
i study molecular biology , and i &apos;ve just been studying a couple of years of biohacking , and i &apos;ve started , because i just wanted to know , and i wanted to make it even more , what i learned in the study of study .
so , that was my primary motivation .
so it was a curiosity , and i somehow wanted to get closer to the matter of matter .
i think the molecular biology in general is now speaking , so generally , biotechnology , everything you tend to do , synthetic biology and so on .
extremely important is already extremely important , and much more , much more important in the future .
there are so controversial things like this all changed the entire genetic plants .
there are now craig venter in the united states who tries to make biotax , so gasoline from algae .
and then there are things that are totally in the everyday life , which is the most people not aware , for example , for example , the enzymes that allow us to wash four degrees of laundry , are also genetic enzymes .
and the list can continue endlessly .
and so from the interest in this technology , i just went further down there .
so , why now hack ?
most people know that from the software area .
computer hacking , and then it becomes the media in the media , yes , the hackers break somewhere and claws and so on .
that &apos;s kind of sad for the hackerscene , because it &apos;s not that true , what it actually did , and what &apos;s really behind it .
and the software hacker , in the &apos; 70s , started with computer engineering , and it came from the internet .
and it &apos;s about having a playful , creative , original way of solving a problem .
and problem , that &apos;s not just a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can also be a problem of what things suggest , so any problem problem , a question , to throw a question , and how you can do it differently .
and it &apos;s become the amount of software with software , but there are also in the electric field , because there &apos;s also a whole built-in scene that can make all kinds of waste things .
and now in the direction of biology , and that &apos;s where i want to take this metaphor that comes from the synthetic biology , that biology is actually a science of information , because the d.n.a code is an abstract code that is an abstract code , which is , you know , real matter , because it &apos;s kind of dynamic , because it &apos;s kind of dynamic , because it &apos;s kind of dynamic , it &apos;s real matter .
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can also program it , and you can also hack it , so you can , and that &apos;s what i found incredibly fascinating , and i just wanted a lot deeper to get on .
it actually took a couple of thousands of them to really take this networks .
there &apos;s hackers &apos;s critics org , which is originally from switzerland , which is related to europe and with cooperation in india , but now members , or active people around the world .
that &apos;s what has a more artistic orientation , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers in collaboration with scientists working with these technologies and asking the creative , because there &apos;s a museum , and yes , everything .
but it &apos;s actually always about trying to find such a little bit of access to having a playful deal with that .
and then there &apos;s do-it-yourself organic commentary , d.i.y.bio .
this is a network of the united states , which is actually more of a kind of forum , where you can go and debate it online .
they &apos;re a little bit more technical , and a little bit of business on the road , and then they &apos;re asked , yes , they ask questions .
and based on these networks , that made the whole popular , has evolved a scene that i &apos;d like to stress for a moment .
here in the image on the left , you see biotso , which is a hackerspace , so basically a kind of school , a private school , a private school , where everybody can come .
children , old , all kinds of people are going to go to a little bit more easily , they &apos;ve set up a lab and look at what &apos;s going on if these lab records are going on .
the one on the left is a group in indonesia , house-functioning disorder , which is that there are quite a long time .
it &apos;s more than those other two networks .
they &apos;re also engaged in such an artistic aspect with biological materials and , yes , electric electronics , and combine it in a pretty rough way .
a group of ankara that i met before a while ago , which is a student group , waiting for the public to give more to the public , what they &apos;re learning in college , and they &apos;ve tried to tell people what is the d.n.a .
and i have a lecture up on copenhagen in the medical museum in copenhagen with a show to the subject .
and this is , yes , that &apos;s the most likely young people , but the only thing that all the united states is in the united states is this fascination .
and what you can do with it , and you can just go to society and ask , &quot; okay , what do you know , what do you want to do , have your interest with it ? &quot;
so , o.k , now to hack biology , you need some material .
you need , of course , biological materials , and you also need tools , and that &apos;s a lab .
and in addition , what you normally understand in a lab , these are kind of like the machines , extremely expensive , extremely , extremely distance , for professionals , trained academics and so on .
and our approach was to say , &quot; yes , that &apos;s what you have to do . &quot;
it &apos;s actually not necessary because every single coffee machine has actually developed higher technology than most of the lab lab devices that really is .
and s with this premise with this premise then has tried to take for example brian degger in england , to put a minimum pressure in the u.k. , then took a crosspressure pressure , a hot plate and , yes , so clean acid .
so every one of the things that happened to be used is a soup that has been left too long , even before .
and i tried this in my lab , a little bit , and then i was able to take care of equipment on ebay and made a little carn.a analysis , trying to do a father , so home .
this is not supposed to be a joke now , but it should .
there &apos;s the picture down here in the picture , and it &apos;s the lab , so there &apos;s a garage with it , so it &apos;s a garage with all kinds of lab lab , which has been in college , a group in paris , which i &apos;m also going to cut on a project .
and this is bioamputation , which also mentioned hackerspace , this fact , such a kind of folk school for molecular biology .
and yes , so you can see , it &apos;s relatively relatively heteromic , so there are people who are doing this at home , so far to larger organizations that are going to do that more culturally in institutional form .
but always the approach is that it should be simple and accessible .
the first project we &apos;ve done as an international group , when we &apos;re sort of aware of ourselves , we &apos;ve become here as a real scene , and we &apos;re here online , and we &apos;re all like this , and we know the people who are always there .
and then came from the do-it-yourself organic bioorg website of the founder , and has said o.k , we &apos;ve got to really meet now , also true , and then have two events , one in london , two and a half , and shortly after that in the united states , in san francisco .
and then , because then , yes , yes , who are we , what do we want , what do we want to say ?
and what are our values and what are our target , our foundations ?
and then we &apos;ve been working on a code-ope .
it was quite intuitive , so everyone has just so much his wishes , and that , and what it &apos;s going to do is say , you know .
and that &apos;s where i think a very good code was done .
and what we have is not commitment , but that &apos;s the case , i think , is pretty good , that people are quite convinced about this .
and we actually tried to bring it back into the academic world , but it &apos;s somehow not that way .
so i think we &apos;re out of biohacking scene in terms of even a step further than the academic world .
yeah , what projects are we doing now ?
a project that i did with the hacking network in switzerland was that we wanted to create something called optical trap or optical prints .
this is , if you focus a laser beam , on a room in the room , then you can capture small particles in the air or in the liquid and then focus in this focus , so that &apos;s like a kind of tractor in principle .
it works really , it &apos;s going to be done in academia , and then we thought o.k , we may have a webcam , then we &apos;ve taken a webcam that goes down , and then you have a microscope that is expanding , you have a microscope that grows about four hundred times .
this is what you see down there .
and then we went down to a d.v.d burning , and we pulled down the firing the laser , and then it tries to focus on this camera .
and unfortunately , it didn &apos;t work , but we still learned a lot about it .
another project that looks like this from the french group of paris , which has worked , is pretty cool .
and that is , he has such a kind of brain wave device , so vele.g or something , so he has been dealing with neurobiology , his nickname is sam neuroscience .
he then put this helmet over there , and then in cooperation with the museum , it &apos;s walked .
and then you could go into the room in the room , sit on this chair , put it into this helmet .
and then they measured their brainwaves , and depending on what they thought or how they thought they were , they &apos;re different lights in the room .
was a pretty nasty project .
another thing out of the united states , which has just to do with this dad history , is the p.c.r , which is the polymerase-chareaction , complicated word .
so it &apos;s about copying genes , to replicate , to reproduce , d.n.a , so you can make them visible .
so , if i do that , the profiler at the scene of crime , then go down there , collect any hairpling , and then they do this approach , and then they can say o.k , this hair belongs to these people , so .
and the machines that are doing something like this are pretty expensive to buy the cheapest , the cheapest to go into four-thousand euros .
and that &apos;s not in the hobbyfield , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that can also do a lot .
so this is just an application of many that you can do with it .
and they have two builders , and they said , &quot; well , we &apos;re doing a simpler and cheaper , and we &apos;ve got out of open source , so free hardware , clean hardware , electric things , electric things , they put together this device , and they &apos;re now given the cheapest vends .
i think somehow six dollars or something like that .
but anyway , it &apos;s still not cheap now , but it &apos;s definitely in a frame where it becomes very specific .
so i think it &apos;s a very compelling hack .
a project i started to build was to build a gun gun .
gene-gun is , yes , like a kind of air pressure that shoots about so far , two centimeters or so .
you charge d.n.a on a gold particle , and the goldparticles then into this air press , and then i &apos;ve shot it up , and then i &apos;ve taken the light to it .
so the device you see there doesn &apos;t work .
but that &apos;s my prototype , but that &apos;s pretty much been looked pretty much , so on a branch , the thing on a branch , electronics and pressure , and that was the pressure to be broken .
and then i took one of the sappings and it &apos;s related to it .
one of the sappings , when you do the full power of water , it has enough pressure , so i think so four-to six .
and then you can accelerate the particles very much enough , and then you go to the onion .
and the commercial device costs about five thousand euros up or something like that , by the rate of 50 .
so it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically able to do it .
and that &apos;s the moment that this is just the core cause of the scene , to increase this availability of technology and also increase the information and the question that more people can be engaged there .
because , as i said at the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have pretty much known about it , and also no chance of making it really well .
because if you just read about it , it &apos;s not the same as if you &apos;ve done it yourself or saw it yourself .
and i think technology is becoming more important in our modern societies .
and if you want to meet as an informed citizen in society , and you want to be able to talk , you need access to knowledge and technology .
and you have to do it and understand it and understand it and understand it .
and then the company is getting out of the tracks , and the citizen science .
so what you &apos;re going to do is , you know , as citizens in the position , with these scientific technologies .
and this is the core cause of the biohacker .
these are the people who are at least officially , on the website , d.i.y.bioear website .
this is a relatively remarkable number of people around the world .
and what &apos;s interesting is that they are also in southeast asia .
that &apos;s what i think are there less people than actually exist .
so i know about some who don &apos;t have .
and these are just the biohacker , the individual people .
partly with these hackerspaces , so these places put together .
and that &apos;s really in the beginning .
as i said , it has first begun .
and hackerspaces , the computer hackerspaces , because the c base in berlin was the first nine acres of nine-.
and this is now a gigantic network of very good , yes , infrastructural centers that are represented around the world .
and we hope , of course , that we &apos;re also going to expand and then be connected , so that even more people can get involved in it .
and i would invite every once to deal with it and even try and do whatever .
it &apos;s not so easy , but it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not impossible if you have enough curiosity and there &apos;s enough energy , you get too far .
thank you for listening .
that &apos;s it .
yes , hello .
how do we actually work people ?
this is a question that is very moving to me as a designer in , but also in the realm of the research in the research area and all things in the field of the user experience .
it &apos;s about how to study people in interactive media , so they can use this interactive media , and they create a similar experience .
because i believe that the interactive media in us will address us , cognitive models , so patterns that have been programmed in our biological memory very , very long time , and that we can reprogram the just through interactive media .
and this is very amazing because you actually believe that this whole technology that you &apos;re seeing there is that you &apos;re actually going to get that one in the future , but in fact , the future is right to us with our archaese roots .
now , what are the archaese models ?
i &apos;ve signed up four words and i want to explain the same .
to archaan cognitive models , and that &apos;s the models that we &apos;ve been able to do in the pre-industrial times .
to these archaese models , we &apos;ve heard that we have basically natural ratio to virtual importance .
that sounds unusual in principle .
but i &apos;m going to go back to that , and i &apos;m going to show you about trial that you have a natural ratio for virtual importance .
the second aspect is that since we &apos;ve been able to be able to speak of this archaese models , we &apos;ve been able to talk very , very competitive , even though we &apos;re using a programming language today .
and the third area , actually , explains from itself .
we all know that the interactive media in definition is irlinear , which involves the linearity of the linearity , and what of course tells us that we feel the linearity today as normal .
the fourth point is that the history of information is a place of information .
now , how is virtual , which is actually the most natural thing in the world .
i want to prove that to you .
how many doors does the house have in which they live ?
we &apos;re not going to be able to answer it immediately , but it &apos;s going to happen right now .
they go through the spirit through this house , in terms of them , and look at how many doors there are .
and that &apos;s what they do .
it virtuates the reality of reality without computers .
fantastic , right ?
and there we are trying to work on the media campus for example , the virtual reality in our v.r.-lab , we can actually do it all the time .
and this kind of wealth that the virtual reality is to virtualize the reality that the people in the suburbs have had to have , because they didn &apos;t have anything .
they didn &apos;t have books .
or they didn &apos;t have a photoligraphy .
they had no mass media .
the only thing that they had was her head .
and in this head , the memory was playing .
in this mind , knowledge was called , and using this virtual images , the imagination , they were already passed on .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s so strong in us that we can deal with virtual behavior .
the interesting thing about it is , if i can make a little trip .
yeah , this is .
the interesting thing about this is that at the same time of the human being media producer and the medium itself .
now , if you think a little bit about it .
what are media today ?
then you &apos;ll notice there &apos;s a change .
but that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to talk about again .
fundamental tool of information training has been stories since jevor .
shaans , priests , so-called knowledge of knowledge , were extra to preserve knowledge in stories .
and today , we &apos;re still very , very strong stories .
the author of the book the nih , jonathan gotouall , we still have a hundred hundred hours a year with the reception of stories .
this means for a child that has spent it to reach the most of his life with the recipe of stories .
now we think our love depends on stories that as a child on the lap of our parents .
no , no , far missing .
this is a lot more back in the cultures of the suburindustrial times .
but for me , in the field of interactive media as particularly impressive , that we &apos;ve formed in our biology memory , the ability to think of nonlinear .
i brought you an example of the north american tribe of the nootkaa indian .
and life lived in the coastal region of british columbia .
and as you can see , this is a very rich area , and you had to navigate that kind of island to island , to get food .
and they did this with so-called lead-land cards .
you may know that if you care about it a little bit about the australian archetages .
they have similar principles .
they don &apos;t have lead-land cards , but they used the same thing that they did , or they use mads .
and what the interesting thing about this is that the navigation and the topography of regions could be mapped by songs .
whereas the language refers to subdomation .
that means you have naviessed about sounds and rhythm .
and these sounds and the rhythm have the geology of a region represented , and of course , it allows you to do these songs and put it in different ways and bring it back to the right place .
why don &apos;t we sing anymore to come from a up to b ?
anyway , to navigate .
what &apos;s actually happening ?
this is what happens to gene machine age .
we &apos;ve been moving in this way called vog-age .
this is the machine age , and it &apos;s happening , and it &apos;s the book , and it &apos;s the camera &apos;s photo .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens that we have the responsibility for our memories and the own production of our individual memories on external media .
on the book and the image .
so , unfortunately , we have a piece of god that we have , unfortunately .
virtuality is suddenly alien for us , and has nothing to do with the reality .
bruce brown , a known design researcher at the brighton university , has gone so far to say that these mass media , it &apos;s called the book and the image , so not the television , the internet and so on , what we call virtual media and so on .
let &apos;s make a little intersection .
from the birds age to the machine age .
what has relevance to our thinking and on our minds ?
then that &apos;s the impact of the pre-industrial civilizations .
and they &apos;re over the course of centuries , and more overwrote through the effects of the machine age .
that is , instead of remembering us individually , we have standardized , far common , masses , masses of memories that we can depend on in our personal memories .
we don &apos;t produce anymore .
we have a abstract language of an abstract language .
we don &apos;t think of the thing anymore in images that are not in images anymore , but we &apos;re programming them our language .
we &apos;ve got used to things that happen .
and we &apos;ve accepted the linearity as a law , and there are only exceptions , like the nonlinearity .
what left us is the abc .
still , we are very , very arrested as information training .
the question is , what &apos;s next ?
we had the birds age , we had the machine age , and we now describe the cyber age .
that sounds very deep and sounds very much like science fiction , i know .
but these concepts of cyber age that bring us back these possibilities back back to our capabilities .
it &apos;s virtual , it &apos;s about nonlinear , it &apos;s about ip .
i want to tell you a little bit about that .
there &apos;s technical concepts like the augmented reality , which means the extended reality .
so if you look at google cad for example , then a concept of what allows us to recombine the virtual world with the real world , which means our monkey consent to the virtual , to think again .
another example is the so-called virtual reality .
so , of course , in the context of my talk , we may sound physically in non-existing , virtual worlds , to the model of the cyborg .
and another example is the ambient , intelligent systems .
these are spaces that can respond to a human being .
all of this needs the ability to accept our basic ability , virtuality as a real habitat .
i sat in and i hope the video works , a very , very nice project , which is the bachelorwork of michael burk , anuskake , and jan-moritz .
and the last one is also here today .
maybe you can stand up for a second so that you can talk to the two about the project .
and i brought this project as an example as an example of how back to this archaic , cognitive models .
the whole thing is , i have to say .
and of course , what the rockefeller of course comes extremely close to , and it &apos;s a computer game .
and if i say computer play , you &apos;ve probably been very likely to see that any people in front of any kind of consolous , or that they play with the one with any kind of console in the hand .
anyway , that they &apos;re doing that .
this is a game for outside .
and that &apos;s just to think that i discover the outside world , so i discover the real world .
and this game connects the virtual world , so the data of data that we produce with the real world .
i apologize that i have to cut so hard .
you can explain that much better , because there &apos;s more than that .
and that is that i discovered a city by looking at where places were positive or negative .
and so i get a very different picture of the city , which is a very different impression , which is i see negative and positive zones of a city , and i get a whole different , virtual map of a very real city .
and that &apos;s what we like to look at .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is a little explanation of what you &apos;re looking at .
of course , this virtual world lives in the walls of our cities , is clear .
and with a kind of wallet , we can see these virtual worlds .
so , i like to wrap up my talk to my talk , in the sense that the properties and the skills that we have acquired from the vow age , and we &apos;ve gone to the machine age that has been reactivated by the help of the so-called cyber age , and that we can actually get back to our roots in the future , and that we can actually get back to our roots in the future .
thank you .
yeah , i &apos;m very excited to be with you .
i &apos;ve been asked to see if this bag is there there , and i &apos;m going to talk to you about it .
it &apos;s not going to do that .
i &apos;m also going to resolve what &apos;s inside .
but so far , i &apos;m going to make it a little bit curious .
yes , kids are inherently curious or should be curious , designers too .
i &apos;m a creator of house , so , of course , i &apos;m involved in the subject of curiosity and how it changes the curiosity again , and why we might lose curiosity , and so on .
this is a whole range of things that you &apos;re dealing with next to the actual experience .
when professors are curious , they often get stuck in such a way of research .
and that &apos;s what i had last half a year .
a research semester for natural users design design .
now , you &apos;re going to ask yourself , why do you start using the whole distribution of life with so natural , archaic archetforms of communication , interaction and so on .
and because i just think of one of these little devices , because things are supposed to always be more intuitive , more and more natural , use , and you have to look at what &apos;s actually going on for us , of course , which is ususfriendly or intuitively .
and in front of the background , i &apos;m in the realm of natural users design , so the next generation in terms of human computers in the relationship of the human computer so that our tools , or like the computer , changes from the machine to the digital assistant .
so i &apos;ve been dealing with this when , of course , what or intuitively .
maybe a look at this .
why does that happen at all ?
so if we look at the development of our society , here &apos;s a second , we &apos;re moving from the third to the fourth generation or social species .
so from modern in the computer society .
every society is shaped by a primary medium .
at the beginning , the tribal society through the language .
that means that you &apos;ve been talking to a common language , you &apos;ve been able to communicate with each other , in the same cave , or in other areas , has developed cities , or villages , and that &apos;s what tribal society has created .
the primary medium was the language , something very natural , something very living .
you also had to learn , so no small child can talk about nature , but we &apos;re learning it , of course .
it was then solved by the ancient society and the first form of abstraction .
that was a huge overcry , because , of course , you started to manifest the live language in form of writing , which means what &apos;s liquid and alive , let me start and hack it in stone and so forth .
depending on how i chel and when i whistle , of course , it &apos;s a very different perspective when there &apos;s a living kind of living .
but sukzonal then moved this script as primary media .
then the next generation that we actually live in today .
this is just through pressure and print writing with a guberg and others .
it &apos;s just the same as a monkey , where adel , and other people have said , are you really insane when the people start reading , then they want to talk , and that &apos;s , of course , totally obsolete .
and now we come into the next generation , and the exciting thing is , a generational shift is just a few hundred years , and we &apos;re right now in this phenomenal phase that we &apos;re doing something about it .
so , of course , the confused us , because we look at one side the new media , social social media , facebook usw and so on .
with total transparency , what the new thinking is , what &apos;s going on on the old thinking , don &apos;t tell you that in the laser &apos;s horse , and no more phenomena , or other phenomena , i just want to do that .
and these two worlds straight together , new and old thinking .
so the exciting thing about it is , if you look at this , this new society , this computer company , is a very different amount of mechanisms , principles and archaese paradigm from the tribal society .
now no longer on the local level , but on global level .
we understood that the weather is global .
that the theme ecology is a global one .
not when i think locally , and the neighbor thinks less ecologically , it doesn &apos;t work anymore .
that means the local village has become actually a global village with the same principles , of course , as intuitive , but also the total transparency .
so , as you know in the village , who has something with whom and when , this is what happens today , this expansion of our self is going through these mobile end devices .
it is that we know global fabrivations and faster and more and better .
that &apos;s how it happened in the village .
in front of the background , i &apos;m very busy looking at what &apos;s going on for us , which is , of course , what &apos;s going on for us , of course , what are we going to have , perhaps , what makes the difference ?
because often people come , they can &apos;t use it friendly , so everyone can deal with it .
so you have to engage in what is that , and not just easy to change that it &apos;s different , but it should also be better .
and when , of course , a little bit intuitively , and how can i take care of it as a creator and make things like this , that they &apos;re a user friendly , so they &apos;re intuitive , because they &apos;re fun to use .
you &apos;re going to be busy , even during the study of perception and the perceptual system .
and this is , of course , where you start and look and say , okay , now i just look inside the inner self .
and what does it actually look like in there ?
so how do we work when we look inside ?
and what does that mean , of course , intuitively and how do our channels work in perception and how does it work ?
because steve jobs once told you , you need to realist to cradle show it .
so you really have to look at the details when i want to make something friendly or intuitively , which means that in the core .
and you can see , you know , one of our seven senses , most of us think we have only five , it &apos;s even already seven , because it certainly comes in the near future .
and to look at how we process information , how do we take information ?
to say , what is information ?
information is every difference that makes a difference .
many use the word , but don &apos;t even know what it means .
but i have to understand in the core , in the nature , when will information become information , when will be made out of data and from information , so i know how i can make things more intuitive or more of course .
and of course , design influence influence .
we see this here when i do things , then i can hack them like on the right side , where i don &apos;t know what is salt and pepper , or i can sort of make it intuitive by showing things .
so very much natural , in one of the gourhes , but i look directly where it &apos;s salt and pepper .
and if i tell someone , give me salt or pepper , he &apos;ll be thinking about where is it .
and the one on the left just intuitive , and then hopefully , i hope that no sugar is in it .
but also our perception itself , how do they fake us ?
for example , this perception in context .
the right circle looks bigger than the little , even though it &apos;s not the case , but they &apos;re just the same size , and yet our perception , depending on what context we put in things .
does anybody know what that is ?
come on .
matthieu is still going to work .
that &apos;s where it &apos;s going to be more like my glasses .
so it &apos;s &apos; the circle .
a second circle already starts to correlate , or associate .
and if i put a half on a half , we don &apos;t even look at one unit , which is a circle , circle and , but we see a unit , we don &apos;t see three pieces , a circle , a circle .
this is what you call the laws of law , or you &apos;re mapping psychology that also affects us in perception .
important for the creator , the most frequently in the first semester , the great ska laws .
distribution of law near , distribution law of the continuity and so on .
it &apos;s often in the third .
but this is an essential part of an important part of what if you want to make things more intuitive .
the next phenomenon , which is also interesting , is the visual vision .
it sounds very simple , but it &apos;s interesting when you get closer .
so we have the eyes , and now you think we &apos;re looking at the back behind .
that &apos;s wrong .
you &apos;ll see by the back of the back .
because they &apos;re projting an assumption for the beginning that they see something that they recognize , unprecedented circle .
that means we &apos;re just projieting our vision before we see it , and then put it back in our way back , to say , okay .
i have so cognitive back , you &apos;ve got what you want to see .
and that &apos;s also where it comes back .
and then it goes back to the front , because the back of it doesn &apos;t tell you , and it doesn &apos;t say , you know , it &apos;s really going to look like this , and i &apos;m sure if that &apos;s what you want to see .
and then it goes back back and then it &apos;s actually going to happen .
so a very , very interesting process of how certain things happen and in what &apos;s happening for milliseconds that are happening .
i don &apos;t know who you know this picture .
that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;ve described to you .
now , everybody &apos;s trying to recognize something from this pattern .
i don &apos;t know who you see .
does anybody see something specific ?
a dalmatiner , right .
once i &apos;ve seen that that there &apos;s a dalmatic in there , you know that .
you &apos;ll never forget it anymore , because i &apos;ll show you where the dalmatiner is .
now you see the dalmatiner .
and further , now you see him .
that means i actually spoaked it out now , that they don &apos;t recognize any pattern in it , but i &apos;ve turned it in a very short time , again , to see this dog in the picture .
and this is this projection of vision , recurrent feedback .
now i know , and now i &apos;m going to try to see that i see the dalmatiner .
i see the dalmatiner .
so , quite exciting processes , which then , in this one , is actually not , but , you know , in this red mass , there &apos;s just about it .
does anybody know what three seconds are ?
long , yeah .
that &apos;s our present .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as designers .
if i know something takes three seconds , until i kind of get out of the present loop in the past , i can just rebridge a very good wait in the past , where i always put it with three seconds .
it has to process the present .
then it goes into the past , and so i can rebridge a very elegant wait for example on the computer , if i know this phenomenon .
what takes five milliseconds of seconds ?
yes , milliseconds .
it &apos;s also a very exciting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the time where you fall in love .
that means warning , if you know that now , look at who you &apos;re looking at for a long time , because i &apos;m not going to pick up what can happen to it .
and six milliseconds , also a very interesting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the time of most perceptions we have .
that means that the first impression happens in a serant fast speed , as we perceive things .
and as we see things , what we &apos;re looking at , and how we &apos;re looking at our environment , so we can think about it as well .
of course , the creator is not just dealing with perception and neural processing and cognitive processing , but of course , with the subject of human objective relationship .
so , as a human being , with certain things about it .
there &apos;s a product of language the practical functions , so formulal aspects , or formaesthetic aspects .
there are features of where i know exactly where i have to reach .
but there &apos;s also symbolic functions , why is there somebody for such a small act , where no matter what &apos;s going on , so horror sums of money , even though it &apos;s not that practical ?
so we &apos;re more likely to rely on the symbolic level of what we think of as a creator of course .
back to my actual theme of natural user interface and the theme , which is , of course , dack , is usps-.
usps-always means , how can i get close to a certain goal , or how can a user benefit in a certain benefit context effectively , efficient and happiness ?
this is what it says more like the norm .
how can i make something friendly ?
i can do that directly , or i need &quot; hand handbook , &quot; or i need to do it .
and less pipelines or use is friendly .
that i do that just differently and beautiful , doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s better handable .
you have to understand that too .
and then , if you look at the software that we &apos;ve seen , it &apos;s going to be you understand why nine percent of our software today is a little bit intuitive or not use on anb , which is , in fact , more intuitive than classical software .
this is not an intuitive usability for apple to have a major economic factor for the apple factor , most fundamental success factor when i want to use technological equipment to people .
why ?
because in the rule of this new possibility , the natural user , which is the natural user íer , for example , five times faster in our goal .
you have to imagine that if you do something of the classical stuff , five hours , and that new kind of natural software just one hour .
that doesn &apos;t mean that you probably have to go home four hours to go home , but your employer , or somebody , falls out of a way that it &apos;s related to the four hours .
but , of course , i want to say that , of course , it &apos;s for us , of course , a performance improvement .
so if we put ourselves in the field of software , here &apos;s the first cad interfaces that were very abstract where you needed months to deal with these systems .
then the next , the next neural model , or mental model like software , came to work , which is , you have an idea of something that metaphor , the metaphor of a desktop to use the computer .
so no longer zeroes and ones or claws , but a metaphor .
that made it much more important , but of course it &apos;s much better .
the next generation of the graphic user field is very much more related to behavior .
so i have a lot of more and more frequently the behavior than that .
this is also a paradigm shift .
so once i look at that , it &apos;s always inimportant to the success of the success , the usihuis an applikation .
and if i take a step further into these natural users , where i &apos;m in voice , language , with touch , per gesture and no more mouse , the things i have to control , i &apos;m still faster and more .
but this brings me back to the point , when things are actually going to be intuitive ?
if you get intuitive and then i have to go back to my little friend here , and look at what &apos;s going on from the point of cognition , when is it really intuitive ?
and that &apos;s all the time for us to do something intuitively , if i have to think a little bit about it .
so he doesn &apos;t really want to think , but it &apos;s easy to do it .
the less i think about it , the more intuitive it is .
and what does that mean for designers ?
so , if we look at the fact that we can transmit existing models of existing models on something else , for example , the metaphor , then i can use it as a creator .
that means that i can put a more intuitive human model on a software model and make the software much more effective .
now , of course , the question is , what is the most intuitive thing to do about human beings and now i &apos;ve already said it .
this is the so-called madness model .
the use of each of us and the ozone is an acronym , and it stands for ownership , selective , transactions .
it makes any of you all the time , but it &apos;s meaningless , and it &apos;s kind of intuitive , or partly , instinctively .
the model is already made in the womb and is interculturally , so it works in the world at young and old , and it &apos;s used all the time without most people knew that this model is present .
oopy ockens is going to be about 50 to seven thousand thousand times from the activity of activity , so you &apos;ve noticed that it &apos;s going to be less frequently balanced than the day .
i can now justify this mental model model , selected , recognize , transactions on interaction system .
and through this kind of transmission , similar to the metaphor of the intervention , but now it &apos;s not a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of an action curve .
and this is on a higher gral of the users as the transmission of a classic metaphor , which is the disprint .
and if i overwear that , for example , i think of as oversight , selecting as choice , witness in the case , it &apos;s big to me , i can look at it in the details , and yes , transacts , i can throw it anywhere or send it to somebody else .
then i can transmit the whole thing .
i &apos;m trying to do this by an example .
all right , everyone has eaten cake .
overlooking : now i &apos;m interacting with the object , can zoom back out again .
i &apos;ll get the whole view of the whole view now , and i can tell you , show me just all of the things with chocolate for example .
and once an interface , what is much more intuitive and much more natural .
because i can grab things like the bits of touch , touch and come to me , is much natural than if over hierarchically organized websites or other mechanisms can make these things available .
imagination is more stimuli , and with this sentence , i want to close , a and another clue , also , designers have to think differently , to come to new solutions , and , in this sense , thank you very much .
i want to share with you a very specific aspect of curiosity .
the first , if you &apos;re going to be a child big , as a baby , is that you &apos;re going to take care of what you have , yes , right ? and depending on whether your parents have allowed you to play more or less , of course , it &apos;s going to sell your curiosity .
and the curiosity won &apos;t learn .
that &apos;s why all of those are and curious , in fact , people who have a property that you can &apos;t learn .
i &apos;m now about , basically , this whole environmental debate , the world set , four years club , in quality of value .
and there &apos;s a central point .
and it depends on phosphorus .
give pee a chance .
every day they give you a scale of phosphorus , about two grams phosphorus , and every day you have to pick two grams phosphorus .
otherwise you can &apos;t have teeth .
you can &apos;t store energy .
you can &apos;t have a bones .
we could just glide as a timeline by the ocean .
if we don &apos;t actually take a phosphorus and apply it .
it &apos;s so amazing that we &apos;re doing something here with something that is actually self-questioning , but not that .
because everyone talks about energy , but nobody talks about the phosphorus problem .
the phosphorus problem is much more critical .
we depend on two countries .
we only have two years of phosphorus , and now we &apos;re going to have a lot more uranium in the world with a lot more uranium in the environment than it &apos;s used in all nuclear facilities .
in the last 20 years alone , five tens of tons have been distributed on our fields in germany alone .
and that &apos;s what we take .
it makes leukemia in children .
and we think we would protect the environment if we &apos;re less harmful .
so , for example , the environment , drive less car .
the environment , make less trash .
the environment , they need less energy .
but this is not protection .
this is , as i would say , send your child , just three times instead of five .
this is just a little less destruction .
if we think of the baa to the baa , our entire earth will last , or later a peaceful farm .
that &apos;s why to think about the february of february .
and the most important thing is to look at the ground , first .
in the ground , over six percent of carbon dioxide is stored .
right now , we &apos;re building corn , and we lose between 11 and 30 kilograms of 30 tons of 30 tons per hectper , or also to reverse the meter .
that means we &apos;re losing about five times more than being re-educated .
we can actually first look at the garbage problem .
and it &apos;s all packaging or content .
for example , in open stream , for example , there are 20 percent of the waste of garbage now .
and because we grow older , the wind gets bigger .
it &apos;s kind of like all of you in the forefront .
yes ?
a baby needs about six to six out wind .
we could reduce that , of course , 10 percent , but what does it do ?
this will be balanced in china a second .
this is completely trivial .
so the question is , how do we deal with these wind ?
here &apos;s one of the evidence that men are not pigs .
i want to tell you .
because the phosphorus is emitted in the pigs over the stable components .
people over the urine .
yeah .
so men can &apos;t be pigs .
because that &apos;s what it shows , right ?
traditionally , we think in environmental debate , we &apos;re too many on the world .
and if you &apos;re talking to people when you &apos;re talking to people , if you say that it &apos;s better , you &apos;re not going to be there , you &apos;re going to be comtile and hostile .
and so someone like al gore says , one of our great heroes , there &apos;s nothing more important than the human population stabilize .
in israel , when you &apos;re talking about saving a life , you can save the earth .
this is what it says the more you get around , the better .
yeah .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
if you look at the ants , the weight of the ants on earth , then the ants weigh about four times more than we humans .
i could also take termites , but in the united states , no one in the united states likes to be , even though they &apos;re vegetarian .
that means the ants weigh a lot more than we do .
and because they &apos;re working a lot harder than we do , and because they live only three to six months , they &apos;re in their weight , in energy consumption .
that means we &apos;re not too many , we &apos;re too stupid , right ?
and where you &apos;re looking at how far away we are , what we really wanted to do , and we could , and how sad we are , we can see that , for example , the light is a program , for about 20 , you know ?
you can only be carbon-neutral if you don &apos;t exist , right ?
the only opportunity .
have you seen a carbon-neutral tree ?
yes ?
one ?
that means our whole intelligence means that we want to be angry as trees , right ?
yes ?
no tree is carbon neutral .
luckily , right ?
there &apos;s no problem problem in trees .
there are still six billion trees in the amazon alone .
did you hear a little bit of overpopulation problems from trees ?
that means all of our intelligence means we want to be angry as trees .
and where you see , even in something like demeter , the most pressing bio-- yes agriculture , it doesn &apos;t allow our own metabolic products back .
every year we lose three million tons of phosphorus that really would have to go back .
and we &apos;re too many .
just about it .
so that &apos;s what we feel so guilty about the earth that we say , there &apos;s no bioland , no organic , no organic representation , and how they all say that our own scales go back .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
so we &apos;re too many .
it &apos;s safe to be less harmful , which is oil consumption .
but where are we useful ?
we &apos;re trying to minimize our ecological footprint , but it &apos;s about having a big footprint that is useful .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but when it comes to the environment , it &apos;s the highest , right ?
nullemissions , yes ?
you can only have nulelees if you &apos;re not there .
even if you shoot yourself , you would have emissions .
so you can &apos;t solve that at all .
we can do it differently .
we can get our nutrients back .
we do agriculture in brazil where we return to nutrients .
all right , we can get rid of these kinds of nutrients in agriculture .
we do that in china , for example , where we &apos;re going to take the bottom of it .
in china , one of the things that is called , in china , is another honey today , right ?
and in our western world , we were always too stupid to bring our nutrients back .
that means the whole western civilizastory story is that the city has always taken , but the farmers never gave anything back .
so the cities had to grow more and more , because the farmers went to the cities and the cities had to move away from their nutrients .
so all western rich is always expanding , until they don &apos;t have the infrastructure anymore , and then they &apos;re imploined .
yes ?
in china , it was different .
you &apos;ve done a little bit of civilization over five years , because you &apos;ve always been able to bring nutrients back .
even today , if you &apos;re invited to lunch in china , you would expect them to stay as long as they &apos;re going to stay the toilet .
because it &apos;s unfriendly to go and increase the nutrients .
you have she invited them to lunch , not for nutrient theft .
that means you can see in the internet as you can get the nutrients back .
this is actually beautiful when you do that , so agriculture makes , biogas , on a hect-land country , with five percent of them in favelas , with a farmer in the favela , with a farmer , and they wait for a hundred hundred dollars and they &apos;re waiting for vegetables and eggs and eggs and eggs .
and the great thing about this is that the crime rate in the favelas around nine percent .
so we don &apos;t have to control people as much as being worse .
we can support them to be good .
this is of course high-tech agriculture , but the plants carry themselves .
the side product is clean water .
and they are so designed by the design that a farmer can just plant them .
that means that the criminals can go back .
and none of these facilities , we &apos;ve now built over 100 and a half in the last 20 years , not from those plants ever .
you could just throw it so easily , and then you could throw the plant over over years .
not instead of it .
that means we don &apos;t have to control people as much as a little bit bad .
we can support them to be good .
that means we need to get phosphorus back .
and by the way , if you want to do what you want to do , write on , in germany , it &apos;s best in germany , the best thing that is in france .
unfortunately , not in open stream , but maybe you can help the france a little bit .
because the frankopater plant could get the phosphorus back .
and it has to go back .
we see that that phosphorus really is critical .
and we see that it really works .
we &apos;ve now used three years in holland .
the dutch government has explained they will be the first country in the world , which is going to return phosphorus .
but we need it overall .
you know , there are two countries that control almost seven percent of the world &apos;s phosphorus resources .
there &apos;s a lot of opec there .
these are six countries that control four percent of the oil supplies .
and the oil is going to replace we can replace through others .
but you can &apos;t replace the phosphorus .
that &apos;s not about making the existing a little less bad , but it &apos;s about doing something right .
and the first thing to ask is , what is the right thing to do .
that means it &apos;s about efficiency , not efficiency .
in holland , of course you understand it easier because in holland , the country is built on flowers .
yes ?
imagine if , for example , your wife is sad , if you get tired of them , and you come with 50 roses .
completely inefficient .
but effectively , yeah ?
or take a liar .
a woman in germany eats about six kilograms of her life .
so .
this isn &apos;t exactly a scientific reason , because it &apos;s because we don &apos;t know how much sweet it is going to be .
but a liop , even at that lighting , i can tell you , is completely inefficient , but really , right ?
one thing that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
it &apos;s not resource efficiency , but efficiency .
to ask , what is the right thing ?
not to burn a little bit better , and it &apos;s a little bit better to burn and break it into the inflammation facility , and to lose all the materials for circular cycles , but first of all , how do you include circular cycles ?
imagine mozart efficient .
yes ?
if i invite you to the dinner and say , yes , there &apos;s a pill with disruption and a glass of water .
wonderful , right ?
this is efficient .
everything that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
if you fall in love with somebody , efficiently ?
yes ?
that means everything that counts in life is not about saving .
all environmental debate .
we tell people , oh yes , you don &apos;t have any environmental consciousness in the south .
no , the throw is exactly the right thing , right ?
in every place , where you pull away from , yes , you can do life again .
but the wrong things .
if you put the wrong things away , you have a waste problem .
in how we think of northern .
there &apos;s every footprint here .
if you walk , yes , everybody &apos;s touching the soil .
because the bottom is going to die the mosses , and the wind of the wind and water is coming off the ground .
but if you &apos;re in italy , everyone means your footprint , that the water is longer in the meadow .
so , it &apos;s about making a big footprint that becomes a wetlands .
not high school management .
we say in germany sustainability .
yes ?
but if i ask you , how do you deal with your wife ?
what do you say ?
sustainable .
then i say , heart anxiety , right ?
that &apos;s the minimum .
so don &apos;t save , prevent , avoid .
each waste is nutrient .
and it &apos;s a privilege when you see in italy , the people in the high peacan can kick out of the car .
because you know , that &apos;s a fun process .
it &apos;s form of refourth behavior , right ?
you can show , i was there .
but with the right design , please .
for example , we developed an iron disk that &apos;s in space temperature .
you can kick away where you go and stand .
in two hours they build all over .
and it contains seeds from rare plants so they &apos;re contributing by the throw to biodiversity .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
so there are two circular cycles .
not all of it should be competitive .
there &apos;s a television or a washing machine that &apos;s going to use it to use it .
just the things that are veihing , like shoe solbs , like the brachharge , like the spooils that have to be that they go into biological systems .
things that are used only are going into technical systems .
but today we &apos;re only talking about the biological systems .
yes ?
for example , the sneaker , yes ?
pretty direct , and it &apos;s not for the company puma by birth , but that they &apos;re now helping this company to make these products successful .
because we don &apos;t do things more freely .
yes ?
so , if i invite you to the food and say that , it &apos;s free , it doesn &apos;t help you .
no , we hold what &apos;s inside .
positive .
so not like detox .
not toxic .
but everything that &apos;s inside is useful .
these are the first shoes that you can put on the cvaliery of the foot , and you can go the rubber in biological cycles , right ?
all of it is comtile .
and when it comes to us , of course , we can do it for obese , for nike , for hennes and serentz and the whole textile industry .
and that &apos;s half of all the water problems in the world that are caused by the texture industry .
that &apos;s why they help , ask for the people .
hey , puma , are you really serious ?
because they &apos;ve changed twice the pre-shops .
and i &apos;m not sure that they &apos;re really holding up .
so , help me do a little bit .
but it goes .
yeah .
that &apos;s what &apos;s been shown right now .
this is .
we can do things now that if you &apos;re sleeping , if you get broken , you can go into biological cycles .
technical roundbacks are the same .
there &apos;s this kind of direct return system .
this is the first environmental backpack , actually , that &apos;s made back in the circulation .
so , in every store , you can get the things back .
if you get to that , yes ?
do you remember the windmill ?
now , when it &apos;s the waste .
all around them , they &apos;re all around .
in the countries where people get money .
on the front of the depoel , but also in the landscape , yes ?
if we change the plastics so that it can go into biological systems , if we change the water of the water , that they can just go back to cell gas , then they can grow with a baby in israel or in tunisia .
yes ?
in fact , if you take this windmill , you tear it up , methane and the powder in order to plant trees .
so the baby is positive for life , by the beginning .
so , we don &apos;t need to be carbon-neutral , we can be positive .
it &apos;s sort of a orthodox operation print .
yeah , somehow .
yes ?
we can do that .
we can reinvent everything else .
i started a institute .
now , a lot of people are working on and they can be engaged .
there &apos;s extra one of them to craddle to cradles , where everyone can get involved .
so no longer save , prevent , avoid , prevent , no school management , but smart waste .
do you make it curious ?
thank you .
the work of expression .
music .
in the description of the description of my speech , i wrote that i consider as a translator , so in the english lexicon , i understand .
expression are the translator of writing notes in clinical music .
that you have to understand as a translator for word in a different language , but also the deeper sense of words and vocabulary to understand it has to understand a meaningful translation , everyone who has to do with foreign languages .
in the english to translate from the english to english , more knowledge needs to be , once you go around , if you &apos;re about poetry or even poetry .
but very alien , it &apos;s for salmon what we do musicians with our music language .
when a musical piece of music i first got the writing notes .
you think that the composer is written in the notes exactly everything that he was thinking about .
in reality , the notes are very vague and unaccurate .
these notes are just about exactly the same or unaccurate , like an empirient , if you seem to be very strict , description of a landscape .
because in this setting of land , the smell of flowers doesn &apos;t smell the flowers , the way that the greens of the founding doesn &apos;t hear it , don &apos;t feel it .
that is , the interpretering has to translate this unprecisely view of the language into another , which is hearing , concrete , non-verbal music language .
today , i &apos;d like to share with you what else i &apos;m doing in musical music , so you see , again , in a verbal language .
so basically , a translation of translation .
that &apos;s why i prefer to do the whole thing on german , because if i had to translate it into english , it would be more important for me in translation of translation .
so the music works for me as much as spoken language .
the key notes made the function of the letter of a script .
so it &apos;s not enough to learn just the notes to learn and push the piano on the piano or the right place on a violin string .
that &apos;s just the letters that you &apos;ve learned to paint .
the point of the letters , you can only see that if you can do the language .
so , for the learning process of music , you need at least as long as spoken language .
and then there &apos;s also hints , whether you learn it for the high-practice , just passive , or you can also talk to the musical mother &apos;s language .
the work of expression begins like the kind of theater class class .
after the first time you &apos;ve chosen to play a piece , because you &apos;re excited about it , you &apos;re going to start studying research , you know ?
you collect information about the play in the literature .
you read in the letters , taats , notes , or whether it &apos;s words , thoughts from composers themselves .
you studied the works he posted before and after .
you compare it .
the mobile causes , to write it .
how and what did he find ?
how was his living environment , like the society and the politics ?
that &apos;s all i &apos;m interested in .
you &apos;re thinking in that time by looking at contemporary images , or reading literature .
but over time , you also have an all-rich knowledge to know the composers that you &apos;re playing , and it &apos;s getting easier to think in it and feel it .
the composer is getting more and more to the friend that you live with .
his cause to write the piece will always become more and more to my personal concern , to play it .
now , there &apos;s the notes all the other other than a very accurate record of the composer , but just a framework , i &apos;m now changing this framework to fill it up with sense and meaning .
i say then with my own words , what could be written between this framework .
i play what these sounds might have to mean .
now for me and for the composers , now , what you might mean for him today .
every tone , every phrase , gets a sense because i feel it , because it &apos;s made out of my own personally .
it has to be in here for me and now , i don &apos;t have to convince my audience that that is my cause .
it &apos;s always a very happy concert when i have to have the experience that i &apos;ve been working so long in advance of how new .
as you &apos;ve reexperienced a happy new day , even though with the same rituals of life , get up , early detection , to work , i have the same kind of time back to the new .
i &apos;ve become a day older , and the seasons change , my pulse goes down in the evening as the morning , in a concert hall , it takes longer that sound comes back as home .
i take that to the audience &apos;s audience , consciously , or unconsciously .
all of that affects me , and all that influenced my experience as well .
all right , when i &apos;m standing with a shower partner on the stage and we have the same wavelength .
then the same thing happens in a good , preditioned conversation .
you put a new idea in and it &apos;s going to answer that answer with a reaction .
it &apos;s exciting , because things that we don &apos;t have to do , and what you can &apos;t do .
it &apos;s really fun to make music in this way , and then you &apos;ve experienced the audience , how music communicates alive .
so every concert is another concert .
i &apos;ll never play more like that at this moment .
i can &apos;t play the way in 20 years today .
i &apos;m going to have more life experience than today , and so i &apos;m going to have a lot more coloring in the musical sound of music and emotions and emotions than today .
sure , i &apos;m going to have a lot of colors also out of it , but they get new ones .
have a nice example of this .
it was on a piano crank for music students in my loved old teacher , professor jregene ude , a known beethoven vender , concert , and slow professor of the music school in graduate school .
unfortunately , i was a lot of too young , so he was already emstruck when i finally started studying .
but i was fortunate enough to meet him very early on , three years old , and so i &apos;ve been to my school age .
i was seven , when i went back to one of his courses on one of his courses , and i played the last four balconters of chopin , one night .
he asked me what the introduction of this ballet would be for me .
this is such a trained part .
and in my youth , i said , expectation .
he got up and he said , so ?
that must be the difference .
because for me , it means memory .
he was over six .
well , at seventh , you just have dreams , but not a major memories .
i &apos;m going to play the piece of every few years today , and it turned out to me , although no one has changed .
every time it &apos;s exciting , i &apos;ll read something new again .
one example of a whole different area , monet has painted the seerotic x-fold .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but too different days , in different light .
he translated the seerotic shifts , as he saw it , like you saw in this moment .
his personal impressions of the seerotic .
the x-hats interpretation of a piece is like this .
now , i &apos;m also older as a chopin with two-30 years when he wrote the piece .
he &apos;s lived only nine years .
and it &apos;s important to look at the notes over and over again , even though i can memorize them .
to keep twin , directly with composers .
because the notes are the only connection to him .
especially when he died .
now , how do you start talking to the language of music ?
i said yes , you need about the same as for spoken language .
often the music class is that you &apos;re only learning the notes .
you basically learn to read before you just talk to one word .
you learn to find the notes on the instrument on the instrument .
if all of the fingers in time and right like it is in the notes , they come out of sound , they get notes that sound like music .
when the error happens , the student gets the next hard piece .
talking about interpretation will hardly be spoken in the first class .
all right , there &apos;s preafo , which is a quick piece .
lento , slowly .
and loud signs , and b , etc .
that &apos;s what most people know here .
but even if you look around , it still stays a little bit of technical technology .
and it &apos;s still not an interpretation .
i wonder .
i wonder that you often forget something very basic .
because to make music on the instrument that should do their musical and feel before .
that &apos;s the singing .
a child that doesn &apos;t learn to sing that because it doesn &apos;t have the parents to do it by itself .
this is like speaking learning .
it &apos;s necessary to have its own experiences and the idea of the music to get over another possibility , so to make sound sound .
people who have never been able to have felt immediately with their own body as it is to form a sound .
a phrase with his own breath .
the music of music is the extension of our body .
our vocal tags to sing , our hands and feet to dance .
so the hammerheads in the piano are the sequel of my fingers .
the melody comes out of the local gene and the rhythm of the dance .
the philippines of the world today with music is not profitable .
you don &apos;t need to make music yourself if it &apos;s being bored .
no more needed to whistle a loving or to sing .
each of your own music is made when you &apos;re constantly exposed to the outside with music .
sure , there are some of you who say yes , but what do you do when i can &apos;t sing ?
i ask you , can &apos;t you sing , a , because you believe that you can &apos;t sing ?
or b , because they haven &apos;t learned to sing ?
in both of them , it &apos;s not too late to start to find out whether they can &apos;t do it , or learn how to make these little muscles that make the vote right .
because you can train that .
or c , because you &apos;ve given it to you that you &apos;re uncompassionate .
i wonder , how meaningful was this diagnosis ?
have you got a second -- or a third opinion , how to say it today ?
or d , you don &apos;t like to make music , and therefore you don &apos;t want to have some nix .
but what i would regret , because music is a beautiful , communicative thing .
but maybe you can also revote them .
well , you can see , all of the cases don &apos;t have to be a steady candidate .
but don &apos;t tell you , i don &apos;t understand the classical music .
i can &apos;t say it &apos;s good or bad .
i say , but i &apos;m sure you can say , it may or not .
because i don &apos;t think it says , i don &apos;t know if it tastes me , because i can &apos;t cook .
so , they don &apos;t give for food , just because they can &apos;t cook .
so they don &apos;t have to kill classical music because they don &apos;t play an instrument .
listen consciously , and say if it &apos;s taste you or not .
whether the music is you too sweet or too sweet .
tell that what you feel .
and at the time , they &apos;re also going to tap on and want to have a little more spep there , or taste , even fine .
now why am i challenging from my audience that it &apos;s also active ?
because the music is a language , and a language is to communicate .
a piece of artwork you never look at has no force to work .
the food that was cooked by a chef , or a chef , has to be eaten , and not just looked at recipes .
so please listen , if a music is played .
it &apos;s not just a nice sound paper .
if in a environment where the adults are being active or active music , a child is growing up , then it &apos;s very easy to ask for a music teacher , to ask what color has your flower ?
can you also play them in blue ?
and the child is playing after a memorial , instead of a red flower , a blue flower .
and this sounds very different from before .
that was the first beginning of a piece of own musical expression .
so the first step to a interpretation .
and what happens when you play a piece today that was originally written a hundred hundred or three hundred years ago ?
now the tools have progressed .
there was a keyboard at all time when an instrument is still not a piano .
it was just not invented .
i think the stream would have been excited if he had had the ability to have the sound of modern shells today .
i can today have the ability to have the sound that had the stream on the modern wing to sound , which is not a barosh cembalo .
and by beethoven , you know that he heard more than he had heard .
today , a modern orchestra is able to play everything , which has a orchestra of the back of the time .
that &apos;s why the composers rely on us who are reinventing the pieces again .
so you can hear what you &apos;ve just thought about in the spirit .
and also , what you would think about today .
or what i &apos;m talking about today because what you might have thought of .
thank you .
you know what is envy ?
have you ever been envy ?
and how did that feel ?
drinking .
i have a friend who drives a paskin .
and when i come , with my little v w , and i &apos;m wrong , this feeling .
i &apos;m looking through my head .
i say ultra-f , what do you need to be big car ?
that &apos;s the first year half of his value .
and at all , you &apos;re working a lot less than i am .
why do i have to afford that little car ?
and then immediately it falls to me , that &apos;s uneasy .
it &apos;s against justice .
and as i say the word of justice , this unpleasant feeling is gone .
our organism has invented a great way to make such clear feelings like envy just to disappear .
you can try this with words as well as revenge or profit .
i want to talk to you about this mechanism today , or get something wrong , which is unfamiliar to you .
the mechanism comes from the lie .
but don &apos;t think about the lie as you may have heard of it , if people say , no one has the intention to build a wall .
and then rocks go to them so he would dismiss them .
in such a lie , you see that the liar itself doesn &apos;t believe what he says .
it makes it easy to check that it has very different in mind .
he just deserves them and not himself .
no , the lie i &apos;m talking about , who i &apos;m talking about is that they deceive themselves .
they need these lie to get a life lie to get a self-delusion .
they can get less easily , yes , test or fall down .
they need time .
from that time , an anecdote is talking to you .
the spanish painter , picasso , once suggested a woman &apos;s portrait .
this woman came up then , the portrait would not even look like her .
picasso says , just wait .
it will always be more like you .
at this point , if you laugh , you know how important these lie is and how much time they need to experience what artists are very good for us .
because artists have a functional relationship to the lie .
the artist gives you something , and especially this lady , which you don &apos;t see when you just look at the mirror .
the artist gives you something like this in a portrait of what you &apos;re going to be familiar with when you look at this piece of artwork .
then this unpleasant feeling , it may not look like you , and it will always be more like you .
here you have this mechanism that we can use the lie as a great invention to stabilize our lives .
and not only in the art of art , even in the folk , in the mythology , in stories , it turns into stories .
you may know this idea of the lady that looked at every morning in the mirror and asked him who is the most beautiful in the entire country ?
one day , this mirror says yes , there &apos;s a wonderful one .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
and you also know how much hostility from this true , even the mirror can &apos;t lie , out of this true idea .
but we should just be familiar with the fact that you can &apos;t tell a woman that there &apos;s a more beautiful somewhere else .
here it is required that we understand what we understand from improv correctness .
we need this place to hold that lie that keeps us to keep deception without even alive .
we don &apos;t just have the art of art in the folk cure , but in the science of that great lie .
and there &apos;s this story of the woman of the bischofs worchester .
they heard about this book by charles darwin , the emergence of the species and the ancestry of the people .
that the monkey should come from the monkey and , yes , there would be a common ancestor between people and monkeys .
and then she ran her to her husband and she said , well , that &apos;s probably not true what charles is writing .
the person is supposed to come from the monkey or have a common ancestor .
no , no , it &apos;s not .
and if it &apos;s true , then we have to prevent that people get knowledge of it .
why do we need to stop people to get knowledge of something that is true ?
because without life we can &apos;t live .
because we have these self-deception , this sense of being great , share from the highest creatures , not from such an aventive , from something like an organism that has yet to have a stone and otherwise things that are still unbiased for us .
so , we can &apos;t engage these things .
we need to prevent that people get knowledge of things , especially when they &apos;re true .
so you can see how slowly this mechanism dissolves and look like the traces that he &apos;s leaving on something different than that great picture of ourselves , i want to leave you with another story .
a particularly beautiful story , as i mean .
my wife told me .
she came from school one day , she &apos;s a teacher , and she told me about a student .
a autistic student .
she likes it especially , because he &apos;s got a propension to it .
and she asked him what &apos;s your holling ?
and he says , well , i &apos;m at the fire department .
and because i &apos;m at the fire department , i &apos;m interested in paroi things .
yes , you feel it , if you &apos;re free at this point . there &apos;s something wrong .
i said to my wife , whenever a human being in a moral regulator , the word because , should we try and replace it through the literal , though .
do that once and then you experience the sentence .
even though i &apos;m at the fire department , i &apos;m interested in paroroous things .
they feel that this is the actual truth behind the exploration .
a little bub , who &apos;s not interested in the fire .
it &apos;s interested in the fire .
but there is no one that we can see where you can learn where to make fire .
there &apos;s only the second best , the firemen .
there he was out there .
and this , you know , you don &apos;t tell your teacher that you &apos;d like to put you somewhere , and you &apos;re happy when the fire works up afterwards .
no , it just looks a lot better if we show that we &apos;re in charge of the dangers that the other people are doing when they just fire fire .
here you have this little mechanism .
these hints that in the heart of the bub knew that he &apos;s actually related to the fire , but that he can &apos;t say that .
here you have this censor between the unconscious and the conscious , which immediately jumps on , without that you can do something about it , and the things that you know that you can look very much better for them and others .
so just this is the kind of words that we &apos;re going to use in the language of politically correct speech .
in fact , we know something else is .
but we know if we &apos;re talking about this , the social gangs are very sensitive .
we can &apos;t just do that .
it &apos;s impossible to do things like this in a society that &apos;s supposed to work .
now i want to leave you with what we found in my institute .
after what logic is this deception , these self-deception , the willingness , a different reality than the ones we actually know in the unconscious sense that they &apos;re valid to spread out .
so i want to present to you two , maybe three examples .
the first example is , what many of you know and some of you value , very few of them don &apos;t even need .
i mean the soul .
what is the soul ?
the soul is a kind of intellectual saying about leibniz .
it &apos;s something that is not from stop , materially nature .
and if you have people who are the most primitive belief that they have a soul , or you can also say , you know , they &apos;ve been brought from the soul to life , then the kind of thing that is like the soul has been a spiritual frame of them , not matter of matter , it &apos;s a little stone , it &apos;s not matter of just matter of meat and blood .
and now , from this soul , you think that somehow you &apos;re in this cloudy nature , in this bry nature , c a means that it &apos;s in the latin , you know .
and then , when this windhall goes over the people , then he &apos;s filled with dignity , with the spirit of nature that can only live , yes with soul .
and then he can walk off .
this is the idea of how the soul works .
so she &apos;s supposed to come from the outside to people .
so we should be able to think of it as something that &apos;s essential to our lives .
and if you have this premise in front of you , you understand the logic that we &apos;re going to be able to experience with a lie of our world .
because now you can apply a three-sentence .
three dimensions still know from school .
this is now a three-sentence that describes us a logic .
this is the hardest part in my talk by the way .
here you need some logic , but also the willingness to lie .
so to lie that they can just make these logic wrong .
in this three-sentence , three sentences come from .
the first sentence is , delete it , there &apos;s no soul .
so the second sentence is , if you can see , it doesn &apos;t have a soul .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
i particularly immersed him here .
a third sentence , which immediately comes up with people who have a strong sense of a soul .
they say , who doesn &apos;t have a soul who is dead and can &apos;t say anything .
and here you &apos;re feeling it .
here &apos;s the logic that comes in , yes , in this absurd talk .
you see it immediately .
the first two sentences , which are logically accurate .
because i can say everything .
the logic makes no answers about reality .
i can say the canary is a man .
and if i do , then the canary is a man .
if i don &apos;t have it right , it &apos;s not a man .
the logic doesn &apos;t make any argument about what &apos;s true .
i can claim everything .
but the key is , when i &apos;m right , it &apos;s true .
so if you look out , there &apos;s no soul .
second , if he &apos;s right , he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
these things are logical .
and now our fake consciousness feels immediately that you can do something .
it &apos;s a third sentence that has nothing to do with the first two sentences , and that &apos;s how the opposite of the first sentence is already proven and predicted .
because , in fact , we have to prove whether there &apos;s the soul or not .
but with this logic that it just uses that two sentences are accurate , and a third leads to that , as if he would have something to do with it , we can save our lives .
so , we &apos;re doing it as if it &apos;s actually impossible without having a soul .
and we &apos;re very happy about it .
we can continue these things to different examples .
in the present , we have a very modern example of a modern example of the day .
so you have to think of another philosophical topic , a permanent of the philosophy , present .
that has to do with it that we go back to the four-century century .
there was a scholars who was called johannes buridanus , and after that , the buridanan esel named .
the buridanan esel is a esel who is made of pure nature .
it &apos;s not that soul .
this is a natural thing .
and if you place exactly in the middle between two in the middle of the big harbor , it cuts .
because he doesn &apos;t know what to do at the first time .
so he &apos;s in the middle .
so the natural things have happened .
so , as big forces with opposite preference , each one on each other .
there &apos;s nothing happening there .
only if you put another example , so if you &apos;re going to make a number of fish bigger , it doesn &apos;t need any reason and nothing .
it automatically goes to the right idea .
so if you have this idea that you &apos;re kind of being driven in nature , you &apos;re going to be driven by the larger pile that you &apos;re wearing immediately the feeling that there must be something like a free will .
and if we are here in frankopat at the main , i remember the max planning institute for brain science .
there &apos;s a scholars who &apos;s called wolf , and they &apos;re sometimes saying , &quot; the wolf , &quot; there &apos;s no freedom of freedom .
now we can rebuild the second sentence and say , if wolf &apos;s right , he has no freedom of freedom .
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
and what we &apos;re almost going to see every day in the dayfront newspaper is what you find in this third sentence .
this is something that looks like who doesn &apos;t have freedom , can &apos;t be pulled for his actions and claims to responsibility and , therefore , it &apos;s wrong .
you &apos;ve got it again .
in fact , you have to prove to see if there &apos;s something like willness .
but the logic of deception allows us to do so , as if the first sentence of forelaw is wrong , you have to take the opposite without proof of evidence .
and now you can just , if you want to make anything yourself , if you want to test something yourself , and especially if you want to make people happy , that courage to make a lie .
for example , practice that if you &apos;re going to meet a person that you can say , there &apos;s no foresholders .
and please use the german word for foreholders that means prophet .
you can &apos;t call it , that would be a bit more politically accurate .
say , there &apos;s no foresholders .
immediately , you &apos;re going to have one , of course , for that , of course , experience that you can &apos;t prove .
and they have a problem .
because while you &apos;re busy , you can &apos;t prove that you can &apos;t prove that there is no foreholders , the man is very happy .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he deceived her .
because he has led them to a ride that he doesn &apos;t even hold himself .
because , in fact , this man isn &apos;t interested in evidence .
it &apos;s just interested in embracing itself from the need to prove that there are foreholders .
so , in the way of the point of evidence , you can see the brilliance of the lie .
and once you have an opportunity to feel that three-sentence in other people , they do it , because they &apos;re going to make other people happy when they don &apos;t remember their self-lying .
thank you for your attention .
yeah , good afternoon .
i &apos;ve allowed lilly questions if i may mention it .
she &apos;s one of the organizers here , and she asked me if i &apos;m going to take a talk here and give my idea .
i have to say , you know , you &apos;ve got it , it &apos;s hard to tell me about my idea .
and maybe i may think of my insula project that i &apos;m trying to imagine .
but it &apos;s , of course , the sum , lots of ideas .
i &apos;m probably , you know , the two nice girls are still there , i &apos;m probably in the generation of the generation for this bad oil image , because i &apos;ve already started studying a nine-hundred year machine construction building in karles , engineering , i think , i believe , equipment .
and i went to berlin , because i wanted to make renewable energy and didn &apos;t have that in karles .
there was the nuclear research facility .
they were all murfa , and the jewish was kfa .
these are the names today .
because a good engineer has either built great cars or nuclear power plants .
but this kind of doofes like &quot; solar pendulum , &quot; from which kind of a hundred watts out of the mountain that was a toy .
and in berlin , there was a crazy engineering system .
i &apos;m grateful to the prime colleague man that he touched the word again , because after the mouth , you didn &apos;t use the word anymore , because everything left was bad .
but it wasn &apos;t that much in the &apos; 90s .
there was this kind of self-managed alternative operation , and one of them was sitting in the basberg in the twin mountain , where you thought that was evil .
in the place of terror , but that was called adgonics and has wind power and sunenergy , and i started in the mid-80s .
and yes , a lot of what was said to me , it touches me very , very many , many beautiful expressions that i &apos;ve also been through .
i worked in the collective work for 11 years that was universal .
we were 20 people .
if one didn &apos;t say , that was the editor , that &apos;s got a completely blown . i &apos;ve been doing it for 10 years , whether i really have a good engineering study , because all the colleagues of my father have been talking to him , because all the colleagues of my father have always been talking to him .
it &apos;s busy .
and that was really , very , very , very styling , and then you put it in the same term , and it just appeared a picture on where i was asked for 10 years , a thousand , a thousand mark , of course , whether it should be really the great .
and i put it up until six and six , and then we got together with friends of the company , and then i became an founder of the company , and then with the spin-off ice of one of the world &apos;s largest cellmakers .
a huge deal story , but , of course , we &apos;ve come back to the problem of a growing company , and we &apos;ve got two thousand , a little group , a small group , decided that we &apos;re starting to say small , which is , again , crazy , that people say , what &apos;s going to be crazy , we &apos;re talking about bees .
and i brought you a project that i &apos;d like to introduce you to .
and the title of the presentation was , yes , how to come to a hundred percent renewable .
and we just started asking a relatively simpler story about where you could use a memory today .
on this island , this is the island graciosa on the azrouge .
yeah , that &apos;s the data .
there are four and a half thousand people living there .
they have a renewable energy share of five percent today .
and the question is , why don &apos;t they have more ?
it &apos;s not just technological .
if you build more wind power , the system starts to fail .
i always tell the politicians when they look at berlin-adat our facility .
they &apos;re always saying , why ?
we &apos;ve already got 20 percent in germany .
it can &apos;t be a problem .
but it &apos;s not true , we have seven percent in europe , and our network is physically the european .
if we had 20 percent in europe , we would have the same problems that people have on this island .
the question was simple , that was two thousand in 2006 , the first contacts started with the island , but just through .
as big as it would have to be a battery , so you have an island on 20 , 30 , four , maybe seven , maybe seven percent renewable .
and yes , i &apos;ll go another slide again .
the conventional system looks like this all over the world .
by the way , about a hundred gigawatts of electrical output is built on the world .
this is the performance of a hundred nuclear power of nuclear power , because it &apos;s very fast everywhere .
the energy hunger in the world , which is going to happen , is being accompanied by this , because you don &apos;t need permission .
that &apos;s quick .
you go like this .
and then it looks like this .
in the run , three of these will always wait .
yeah , this is what it looks like at the bottom .
we also got very precise data .
and the wind force or the solar system or whatever it is is , in the rule , it &apos;s a one--up system , which can only eat in small numbers here .
our goal was to just say , okay .
it &apos;s going to roll up and the wind , the sun , the load that you can create the larger share .
and if you want to go over 20 , 30 percent renewable energy a year , energy per year , not the performance of the moment , then you have to switch off this .
that is , at the moment , you have to worry that renewables can take over the whole network .
and of course , you can only do that if you &apos;re going to be in some kind of way here .
no one has done that in the world .
this is in the small style , so you can also use your shading over a little bit of interacts .
people always ask me , what are studies that you &apos;re doing in adgeria ?
that &apos;s what &apos;s going on .
but if you want several of these interliers , and you want to build a net , it becomes extremely complicated .
and our goal was , we wanted to go to the seventh to nine percent renewable , and then there &apos;s still this rest of the rest of the last 10 , 20 percent renewable , 20 percent renewable , which will be done very , very expensive and it won &apos;t work .
this is going to be a case of energy , which then , hydrogen , methane , power to gas , you know , it will be .
you have to go to a seasonal memory , and winter summer , and not just tag-late night .
we just wanted to know what &apos;s about a normal , unregular electrochemical battery .
how far do you get there ?
and then have a whole bunch of simulations .
and there are wind and sun and the burden through that , and came to the conclusion , a very exciting outcome , that you need a middle of about 50 cents a kilo of about 50 cents per kilowatt-hour .
these were the first calculations six years ago .
and then we said , okay .
it &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
we are cheaper than the accumulation system , if the ability cost of five percent per year .
and then we started to negotiate with the israelis .
what had to be done ?
with investors , i &apos;ve been looking for new shells .
we were at the time five people to rebuild society again .
and here &apos;s the representation again .
the brown is sort of the conventional system , the green is our system .
that our system also has an enemy , because we &apos;re still going to do 20 percent with this thing , and it &apos;s a price increase on the other things .
and the current amputation , which is the electric supply company on the island , is what we find great .
we also want to support , but we don &apos;t think you can solve the technical problem .
and so we decided to build a hall in berlin , in which we can sort of be able to make the electric division of the island at three very easily .
that is , we first looked at finding the largest battery in the world .
here it is .
it comes from asia , in the case of japan .
and the funny thing is , she &apos;s in the &apos; 70s in the 70s for the bbc for the bbc , and today , it &apos;s been developed , and then it licensed into the japanese .
it &apos;s you can see , it &apos;s a very , very large battery .
she has a megaperformance , and she can bring that performance for six hours and that &apos;s the battery that we have kind of simulated .
and then they set up .
we &apos;ve also got one of these creats in the same size , as it says there , in the hall , in order to actually see the full dynamic behavior of this network , so this is where it looks like this , there &apos;s the big battery that we can simulate the net .
over here , over here , we &apos;re covering the whole network system , which is miles of the cable of the cable to sort of form vibrational behavior in the web .
and here you can see the whole thing again .
we can turn out two hundred kilowatts of photovoltaics on the net .
so here we see this again , again , we see this , again , the whole , single comedian .
and what we &apos;ve done since we &apos;ve been , for two hundred hundred , the hall has been done , until today &apos;s two thousand 12 , basically everything is between the individual system to develop software , we &apos;ve done it .
so we &apos;re not a marketing maker , but we define ourselves as a company , which is just between the subject battery and the subject , and everything in between .
you have to communicate , of course , to the battery , you have to communicate in the net , and that &apos;s very complicated .
the beauty is that you can basically take away everything that we will get if we want to raise our share of renewables .
so this whole discussion , like this , is going to move back and forth , energy turn , how to go to the island , for example , 20 to 30 percent of them , so we tear the wind and the sun .
it &apos;s natural light , then .
so grid grid , a huge topic everywhere .
we can start to integrate electric mobility on the island , asking , you know , you can do the burden .
that means when you &apos;re at seventh percent renewable , you can &apos;t do it without memory .
you can be through &quot; n markers grid , &quot; you can move through the bed nets , yes , that should be done in any case , but you &apos;re never going to be able to lose memory completely .
and that &apos;s kind of like the message .
so a lot of people come and look at this , because you can see what problems you get .
if we switch off the top of this , you don &apos;t have these raw mass , which causes a certain inertia in the net .
and our european degradation is basically , in fact , from louder masses of large power , where the wave is going across europe all over europe .
we &apos;re looking at this web , and the 50 hertz , and when it gets nine , it will start nine hertz , we &apos;re going to get a little bit back , then we go back up .
that &apos;s the system .
and of course , that &apos;s incredible collections .
if you tear it down somewhere , it takes a long time .
the rockefeller reserve has at least 10 seconds to keep the web stable .
and at the time you can react to another .
if you don &apos;t have that , these roeping mass , then you have to replace that with a health supply and electrochemistry .
and we can switch out with this big battery with two milliseconds .
and then you see the enormous speed possibilities there .
and the message now is , we have to rely on this raw mass , if we kind of like our goals 20 , twenty , 20 percent , 20 , 30 , 30 , 30 percent and so on , if we want to reach at all .
then we have to break our must-run capacity in the network .
must-run is simply called the power plant runs to keep the frequency .
yes , that &apos;s a huge debate at the moment , to build the carbon force , because we don &apos;t , or gasturing , because it &apos;s not .
and we &apos;re just trying to figure out that , you know , you can get the capacity capacity , the must-run capacity , as you can get electrochemical memory into the net .
and fortunately , there &apos;s a whole lot of studies now .
and at that point , people are always coming and looking at our study on the top of our insula .
and yes , the discussion is always about the question , how far can you take a bit of the future there ?
and a lot of discussions i had in the last six years were similar to the discussion that i had in the last 30 years to the project .
it &apos;s not , you can &apos;t make sense , your child play stuff , you can never do anything .
we have 30 gigawatts today in germany .
that &apos;s pre-competitive .
and i &apos;m just going out that we &apos;re going to store the same capacity in the next 30 years in the world .
just , it will come .
there &apos;s going to be a whole bunch of dispositions and procursor .
and the beauty is that i &apos;ve just seen in the last two years that scientists are sitting on my side .
we &apos;ve got about 10 million savings projects now , and it &apos;s about 10 megawatt-battery now at the german net .
this is going to happen in the next april .
so , you know , you know , there &apos;s a change there , and it &apos;s only from this notion of preservation to the idea of a hundred percent renewable .
and if you have a hundred percent renewable , it &apos;s like an abalone system .
so so far , in discussions , it &apos;s always trying to get these terminal , who are doing austek , who have a own little net that has no to do with our and nothing .
the question is , well , if you &apos;re totally non-independent of any fossil energy or uranium energy that will be pulled out in the world , then you &apos;re an island .
then they just use what &apos;s available on sun and wind , where they live .
and this is a little bit of our vision of a subject energy supply , and i &apos;m a crappy to-cradle to cradle , that they &apos;ve said , solar energy .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing , and if we can get the talk , the prime talk of m.a , that you may be a collective and energy energy , here &apos;s a little bit together .
and yes , i just want to encourage you to be in the sense that you can be quiet , and you may have a vision .
and you really have to stay pretty tough , but i think it goes .
thank you .
when steve lopez , columnist times , is the los angeles times , one day through the streets of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , an african-american , sympathy , rau , homeless , who played on a violin , which had only two hits .
many of you are going to know the story , because from the bottom of the articles , later , a book has been stated , with robert grapez junior , as steve lopez and jamie ) x as migrast , who studied the double .
nathaniel left juilliard , ersuffered a breakdown and 30 years later , he lived as homeless on the streets of skde row in the center of los angeles .
i recommend reading all the steves , or looking at the movie so that they don &apos;t just understand the wonderful connectedness that came between those two men , but also , how the music helped the connection , and how they ended up creating the instrument , and then it was the instrument , and , after all , it was the instrument , you know , nathaniel away from the street .
i met mr. ayers in 2008 , two years ago , walt disney sithall .
he had just heard a demo of beethoven &apos;s first and fourth sinfonia , and he came across the stage to imagine me .
he spoke in a very hot and more thorthful sound about yo-yo clinton and hillary clinton , and about how the dodgers would never create it in the baseball world series , and this is all about the sliver passage of the first set of beethoven &apos;s last sentence .
we came to talk about music , and a few days later , i got an email , in which , that nathaniel was interested in the study of me .
i still have to say that nathaniel did have a medical treatment , because he was already treated with electroshoine and a sadden , a trauma that has his whole life .
now , as a result , he &apos;s now very vulnerable for this schizophrenic stages , and they &apos;re sometimes so bad , and he drifted away in the streets of skid row , and that horror and the mark of his own spirit .
and in that same stage , nathaniel was when we started with our first classroom in walt disney dryhall , and he had this kind of wokes in his eyes and he was completely lost .
he talked about invisible masterpieces and smoke and about how somebody wanted to spread in sleep .
i was afraid not to talk about it , but i was afraid that i could lose it in one of his states , and that i could break his relationship in one of his states , and i could destroy him his relationship when i started to talk about audio and ardatic .
so i just started playing .
i played the first sentence of beethoven &apos;s violin concert .
and while i was playing , i realized that in nathanies , there was a complete change going on .
it was like he was under the impact of an invisible doctor , a chemical response , whose catalysts my game was .
nathaniators turned into understanding , in a quiet curiosity and ancourage .
and as through a miracle , he took his violin and he began to play a number of violes of violin , and then asked me to play them : mendelsson , thiicoski , sizikoski .
we then started talking about music , started from bach over beethoven , brams , brucner and all the other bs , from bartk , to esa-pekca .
and i realized that he didn &apos;t only know an encyclopedia of music about music , but with her too close personal relationship .
he spoke to her with a passion and understanding that i would know about my colleagues in the philtexas of los angeles .
by playing music and talked about music , it was from this paranoid , confused man who was just moved through the streets of los angeles , an educated educated musician .
music is medicine . music is changing .
for nathaniel , music is seelian health .
because the music allows him to shape his thoughts and delusions with his imagination and creativity in something real .
and this is how it turns out its agonizing states .
i understood that this is exactly the nature of art .
this is the reason why we make music : so we do something that is in all of us , deeply inside , our emotions , through our artistic lens , to actually form our creativity .
and the reality of the print is all of us , and it moves , inspired and united to us .
what proteomics did was he brought his music back into a community of friends .
the power of music brought him back into a family of musicians who understood his talent , and he ran him .
and i &apos;m always going to work with nathaniel musicians , whether in walt disney , or in skid row , because he reminds me why i became a musician .
thank you .
bruno giussani : thank you very much .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play something that i &apos;m unqualified to stole cellists .
i hope you forgive me .
so i have a lot of fish in my life .
i only loved two .
this first thing that was more like a passionate monkey .
it was a beautiful fish , well-made , fine , good consistent , one of the best books on the menu .
what a fish .
even better , he grew up in aquakultions after the highest standards of sustainability .
so you could feel about selling it .
i had a relationship with this beauty about several months .
one day , the head of the company called the company , and asked if i could do one event on the sustainability of the farm .
&quot; of course , i said .
here was a company trying to solve what was going to be an incredible problem for our cooks , how do we keep fish on our menu ?
in the last 50 years , we &apos;ve raised the ocean as we &apos;ve beaten forests .
it &apos;s hard to overrate the destruction .
90 percent of the big fish that we love , that we love , the tunas , the healing , the lawers , they have collapsed .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
so , you know , or bad aquakultions , you have fiss , part of our future .
a lot of arguments on it . fish plants pollute the environment , most of them , and they &apos;re inefficient , let &apos;s take tuna . a big disadvantage .
he &apos;s got a feed of 15 to one .
that means 15 pounds of wild fish are required to get a pound tuna .
not very sustainable .
it doesn &apos;t taste very well .
so finally , there was a company trying to do it right .
i wanted to supported them .
on the day before the event , i called the head of public labor for the company .
let &apos;s call him .
&quot; don &apos;t say , &quot; just to have the facts right , you &apos;re famous for building so far out in the sea that you don &apos;t contaminate the environment . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s true . &quot; he said , &quot; we &apos;re so far out , the waste of our fish will be distributed , not concentrated . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; we &apos;re basically a world .
this is a two-to-one assessment of two , &quot; he said .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
two to one , great .
&quot; what ? what sticks ? &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . put on .
and at that evening , i was in bed , and i thought , &quot; what hell is a sustainable protein ?
so i called the next day , just before the event before , don &apos;t .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t , for example , what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said he don &apos;t know . he &apos;s going to ask .
well , i was calling a few people in the company , and no one could give me a decent answer , until i finally ended up with the killing biologists .
we also call him don .
&quot; don &apos;t i say , &quot; for example , what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some algae and some fish of fish , and then he said , chicken pellets .
i said , &quot; chicken pellets ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , fethers , skin , bone flbs , dry , dry and food . &quot;
i said , &quot; how much percent rich is chicken ? &quot;
the assumption of maybe two percent .
&quot; well , these are about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t , what &apos;s sustainable about bringing chicken to fish ? &quot;
there was a long pause in the line , and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken in the world . &quot;
i loved from this fish .
no , not because i &apos;m a self-righce , and i &apos;m well-enjoying people .
that &apos;s actually me .
no , i actually love this fish from this fish , because , i swear to god , the fish after this conversation , after that conversation .
this second fish , this is another kind of love story .
it &apos;s the romantic way of knowing the better you &apos;re learning your fish , you love the fish more .
i was eating it first in a restaurant in southern spain .
a lunch journalist had been talking about this fish for a long time .
it &apos;s got us in a sense .
he came up on the table with a bright , almost white color .
the chef had cooked him .
stop .
amazingly , he was still delicious .
who can make a fish so good after he was cooking ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can do it .
let &apos;s call him miguel . in fact , he &apos;s called miguel .
and no , he didn &apos;t cook the fish , and he &apos;s not a chef , at least the way they understand and i understand .
he &apos;s a biologist at psychopatha la palma .
this is a fish in the southern western corner of spanish .
it &apos;s near the mouths of the river .
until the 1980s was the farm in the hands of argentineans .
they were breeding beef cattle , which were basically wetlands .
they did this by turning the country off .
they built this complicated series of channels , and they tested water from the country and out into the river .
well , they couldn &apos;t make that that worked , not economically .
and it was a catastrophe .
it brought about 90 percent of the birds , which are a lot of birds .
and so 1982 , a spanish company has bought the land in 1982 .
what did they do ?
they have the flow of water vice versa .
they literally put the lever .
instead of putting the water out , they used the channels to pull the water back .
they were flying the channels .
they created a $ 1,000 hectares of fish -- barch , mermaid , garal , aal and his company , the ecological destruction and his company completely reversing the ecological destruction .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , they &apos;ve never seen anything like that .
they &apos;re staring out on the horizon , which is a million miles away , and everything you see are static channels and these density , clean march .
i was not a long time ago with miguel .
he &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts charles darwin and part &quot; a crocodile to kiss . &quot;
okay ? there we were and fighting us through the wetlands , and i clubs and sweat , maw to my knees , and miguel keeps an biology class .
here he picks up a rare gliar .
now , he mentioned the consumer needs of physical toplankton .
and here , here he is looking at a pattern of strings that reminds him of the manufacturing giraffe .
it turns out that miguel is the largest part of his career in mikumi national park in africa .
i asked him how to become such a fish experts .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish .
i &apos;m an expert for relationships . &quot;
and then he goes and down into more porn birds and algae and strange water plants .
and you don &apos;t get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the biotic community , the kind of biological community .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
and my head was weak about this piece of delicious fish that i had at the foreend of the night .
so i interrupted him . i said , &quot; miguel , how does it taste your fish so well ? &quot;
he showed up the algae .
&quot; i know , boy , the algae , the physical toplankton , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible .
but what eat your fish ?
how is the feed ? &quot;
well , he continued to tell me that it &apos;s such a rich system that the fish eat , what they would eat in the wild .
the vegetable biomass , the physical toplankton , the zooplankton , is what the fish feed .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely self-dated .
there &apos;s no food .
depending on a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals ?
i went around on this site later with miguel , and i asked him , i said , &quot; for a place that seems to be so natural , &quot; unlike any farm i &apos;ve ever had , &quot; how do you measure success ? &quot;
it was when a movie director would have tried a phase shift .
and we peum around the corner , and we offered the most incredible sight , thousands and thousands and thousands of pinker , a literally the eye .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at your bbs , pink .
she goes . &quot;
so worse ? i was completely confused .
i said , &quot; miguel , isn &apos;t it your fish ? &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and fishing eggs .
well last year on this site , 600,000 birds were more than 250 different species .
it has become the largest and one of the most important private bird reserves in europe today .
i said , &quot; miguel , is it a good way to make a good look at bird birsts in a fish ? &quot;
he threw his head , no .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building judgment , not intense .
this is an environmental network .
the flalegoes eat the shrimp .
the shrimp eat the physical toplankton .
so the frog of the gut gets better the system . &quot;
okay , let &apos;s rethink this . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals and a farm that measures their success at the health of their predators .
a fish of fish , but also a bird reserve .
oh , and by the way , they should not even be there .
they breed in a city of 240 miles away where the amount of soil is better for the nest maintenance system .
every morning they fly 240 miles to farm .
and every night they fly for 240 miles .
they &apos;re doing this because they can get the white line of the land airport a92 consequences .
seriously .
i was introduced to the penguins of the penguins , so i looked at miguel .
i said , &quot; miguel , do you fly 240 miles to the farm and fly a mile back at the night ?
do they do that for the kids ? &quot;
he looked at me when i had just written a song of whitney houston cicium .
he said , &quot; no . you do it because the food is better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my beloved fish , which was delicious , and i don &apos;t like fish . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it .
it &apos;s this one at the end of it .
i almost never cook .
and yet , when i tried to put them in this restaurant in southern spain , she didn &apos;t look at fish at all .
they liked sweet and she was going to take a bite from the ocean .
i mentioned that to miguel and he was nicking .
he said , &quot; the skin works like a sponge .
it &apos;s the last driver before something in the body .
she &apos;s developed in the evolution of evolution to go out and go out of the evolution . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; but our water doesn &apos;t have an incomplete . &quot;
okay . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed your fish , a farm that measures your success success .
and then i realized , when he says , he says a farm that doesn &apos;t have an inert , it drives enormous , because the water that comes through this farm comes out of the river .
it &apos;s a river that leads all the things to it , and this is what the rivers tend to do with themselves , to lead to chemical pollutants , flow of damage .
and when it was fought through the system , and this is blinding the water clean , as it came from .
the system is so healthy , it cleds water .
so not just a farm that feeds their animals , not just a farm that is measuring their success at the health of their predators , but a farm that literally is a waterset of water , not just for those fish , but for you and me .
because if the water flows out , it goes down in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;m going to take it , and that &apos;s what you should do , because this love story , like romantic , is also on top .
you could say that you &apos;re a recipe for the future good food , whether we &apos;re talking about bardge or meat .
what we need now is a radical new concept of agriculture , from one , in which food actually tastes well .
but for many people , it &apos;s a little bit radical .
we &apos;re not a realistic , we enjoy it . we &apos;re lover .
we love markets . we love small family businesses . we talk about regional food . we eat organic .
and if you say that these are the things that are the future of good food , somebody anywhere in and says , &quot; hey , people , i love pink flowers , but how are they going to feed the world ?
how are you going to feed the world ? &quot;
can i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like that question .
no , not because we already make enough calories to feed the world more than just feeding .
a billion people are hungry today .
a billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of krasans in the distribution , not the overall production .
well , i don &apos;t like this question because it has the logic of our food system over the last 50 years .
plea grain of plants , harmful seeds of monocultures , chemicals to the earth , chicken to fish , and the whole time has just asked the agricultural industry , &quot; if we feed more people cheaper , how awful can that be ? &quot;
this was the momentum . it was the rights . it was the business plan of american agriculture .
we should call them what she is , a industry in abjunction , a industry that enables fast ecological capital that enables this production .
this is not a industry , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
our cornchamber is threatened today , not due , but due to the resources of resources .
not through the latest community and tractor invention , but by fertile land , not by pumps , but through the fresh water , not by leiring , but not by fishing , but not by fishing boats and nets , but not by fishing boats and nets , but the fish in the sea .
you want to feed the world ?
let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that are capable of feeding themselves ?
to do that , don &apos;t look at the agricultural model for the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
capital , chemistry and machines are at the top , and it &apos;s never really produced a good thing to eat .
let &apos;s take a look at the ecological model .
this is the one that picks back on two billion years of labor experience .
look at miguel , farmers like miguel .
business , which is not the worlds for themselves , businesses , who are reproducing , rather than they need to grow , businesses that are willing to grow , rather than just high , farmers who are not only organized , but experts for relationships .
because they are the ones who are also experts for taste .
and if i really am honest , you &apos;re a better cook than i &apos;m ever going to be .
you know , that &apos;s right , because if the future is good food , it will be delicious .
thank you .
if i want to leave you today , it &apos;s that the sum of the data that we consume is bigger than the sum of their parts and instead of thinking about information . i want you to think about how we can use information that would otherwise not be visible .
so what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical dying diagram of age .
the program i use here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called pivot and what i can do with spades that i can filter after a particular cause of death , let &apos;s say accidents .
and immediately i see another pattern that makes it .
and that &apos;s because in the middle there , people are the most active and they &apos;re the most pressing over here .
we can step out a step further and then rearrange the data and see that reconditions and cancer are the standard , but not for everyone .
now , if we move forward and we look at age 40 , we &apos;re going to see 40 years or younger , that accidents are even the main thing that people should worry about .
and who &apos;s going to tell you that this is particularly true of men .
so you can see that this is a very important look at information and data in this way in a living information graph .
and if we can do this for raw data , why not for content itself ?
now what we &apos;ve got here is the cover of every single &quot; sports illumize , &quot; which has ever been printed .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
they like to test it for my talk in their rooms .
with spades , you can dive into a decade .
you can dive into a particular year .
you can jump directly to a certain issue .
now , if i look here , i see the athletes that appear in this issue and the sporting species .
i &apos;m a lance armstrong , so i click this way to all expenses in the lance armstrong .
now , if i &apos;d just want to get an underground view , i could think , &quot; ok , what if i look at everything with bike bike ? &quot;
so i &apos;m going to step back and get the perspective .
now i see greg lemond .
and so you get an idea that if you look through this kind of information , targeted , broader , zoom out , zoom out , and you don &apos;t just look at it .
you do something that &apos;s actually a little different .
it &apos;s something in between , and we think it changes the way information can be used .
i want to make this idea a little bit further with something that is a bit crazy .
what we &apos;ve done here is we &apos;ve taken every single wikienbute and reduced them to a little summary .
the summary contains a quick overview and a symbol of the area that comes from it .
i just show up the top 500 of the popular elites .
but even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things .
immediately , we get a sense of the topics that are popular on wikipedia .
i &apos;m now going to vote for the government .
now , after i chose the government , i know that the wiki goveracegums , the most part of time , are the people of the year magazine .
this is really important , because this is a realization that &apos;s not in a single wikid.
that &apos;s just to see if you step back and look at it all .
looking at a particular one of these summaries , i can go into the subject magazine &quot; people of the year magazine , &quot; and all together .
now , if i look at all these people , i realize that the majority of the government officers are . some of them come from science . some , even less , come from the economy . here &apos;s my boss &apos;s music .
and interestingly , bono is also a ted prize winner .
so we can skip and look at all the ted prize winners .
you see , we &apos;re surfing in the web , as if it &apos;s really a net , not just by page , but much more abstract .
and so i want to show you what a little surprise might be .
i &apos;m just showing you the new york times website .
pivot , this application -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not a browser , but you can look at websites with it -- and we can bring that technology into every single website like this .
so i can step back , and i can jump directly to a specific section .
so this is important because only through looking at websites in this way , the whole internet process can look at the same way .
so i can zoom in into my background in a certain period of time .
here &apos;s the entire demonstration of the entire demonstration i &apos;ve given .
and i can sort of get anything i &apos;ve seen today .
and , again , if i go back to a step and look at everything , maybe i can rearrange my course , maybe after my search past , and here , i &apos;ve been looking for &quot; nepotistic , &quot; or here after live labs .
and from here , i can go into the page and call them back .
it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s used over and over again , and every time it makes it bigger than the sum of the files .
now , in this world , we think that data is a fluent .
we &apos;re talking about the fluent of information .
we talk about &quot; drowning in information . &quot;
what if we could turn this situation around and put the internet on the head so that instead of going from one to another to the other , are going to go from a lot of things , and with patterns which otherwise would be hidden ?
if we can do this , then this past data trap , perhaps a new source of information .
and , instead of just moving into information , we can get knowledge of it .
and if we know , maybe we can even even arrest it .
i stop , thank you very much .
i grew up with a sin of science fiction .
in my school , i went to school with the bus every day every day .
and my nose kept in a book , a science fiction book , which led my thoughts to other worlds , and in narerian ways , my deep curiosity was satisfied .
this curiosity was also showing that when i wasn &apos;t in school , i was walking through the forests , and i walked and went &quot; samples , &quot; frogs and snakes and beetles and the cold water .
i was totally thrilled , you know .
it was always about trying to understand the world and to figure out the boundaries of the potential .
and my love to science fiction seemed to crash in my environment , because at the time , in the late &apos; 60s , we went to the moon and exploring the deep sea .
jacques cousteau came into our living room with his fascinating shows that showed us animals and places and a world of miracles that we could never imagine before .
and that &apos;s what i think is fine to the science fiction .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and because it didn &apos;t have video games yet , the computer video games have yet had the whole language in the media landscape , i had to create the images in my head .
we had to do that at that time . if we were to read a book as children , we took the description of the auyer and published them on the screen in our heads .
my response to that was drawing and drawing of aliens , alien worlds , robots , space ships and all kinds of things .
in math class , i was constantly caught by the teacher as i was hiding in the textbook of the textbook .
creativity had to figure out .
and something interesting happened . what excites me about jacques cousteaus was fascinated by the idea of a completely unknown world here on our earth .
certainly i would never have an alien world to achieve a spaceship , which seemed pretty unlikely to me .
but here was a world that i could actually enter on the earth , and it was just as fascinating and exotic as all i &apos;ve always imagined when i read these books .
so i decided when i was 15 .
the only problem was that i lived in a small village in canada , 1,000 miles away from the next ocean .
but i didn &apos;t get upset .
i kept my father , until finally he had a dive in buffalo , new york , out of the other side of the border , where we lived .
i made my dive in a pool of shakespeare in the middle of the winter in buffalo , new york .
but the ocean , a real ocean , i got to face two years later , when we moved to california .
since then , over 40 years , i &apos;ve spent about 10,000 hours under underwater , 500 hours of it in submersibles .
and i &apos;ve learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the shallow oceans , is so rich , as we can &apos;t imagine .
the imagination of nature doesn &apos;t know borders , in contrast to our own fancy human imagination .
until today i feel deep awe for what i see on my dive .
and my love for the ocean is at the same intensity as ever ever .
when i was looking at a profession , it was a filmmaking .
and that seemed to be the best way to tell me , to tell stories , with my need to create images .
as a child , i used to draw books all the time and so .
so films of the path were to bring images and stories together . it would fit together .
of course , the stories i was looking for was the science fiction area : &quot; terminator , &quot; &quot; aliens , &quot; and &quot; abyss . &quot;
in &quot; abyss &quot; i could connect my preference for the underwater world , and the filmenter .
so , basically , my two passions .
something interesting happened in &quot; abyss &quot; to solve a narrative in this movie -- and we had to create a sort of liquid water creature -- we moved to computer generated animation , cg , back .
what came out of this was the first computer generated soft-surwright character that was ever in a movie .
the film didn &apos;t bring money , and he just played his production cost at the moment , but i noticed something fascinating : the audience on the whole world was mesanized by it .
according to arthur clarke &apos;s law , the law is known to apart with each other &apos;s law .
so they saw something magical .
and i found that incredibly exciting .
and i thought , &quot; wow , this must be involved in the movie art . &quot;
so we went to &quot; terminator 2 , &quot; my next film , much more .
and together , with ilm , we created the guys from liquid metal , and the success of the effect was going to come out of it .
and it worked . again , we created something magical , and the effect in the audience was the same , but we had a little bit more money with the film .
from these two experiences , a whole new world was achieved , a whole new world of creativity for film creativity .
so i started a company , with my good friend stan winston , who was at the time of the best make-upmission and cretaliation designer . it was called &quot; digital couch. &quot;
the basic idea of this company was , the phase analog processes with optical pressures , etc . , and to start with digital productions .
we then did , and we managed to have a competitive advantage for a while .
but in the middle of the &apos; 90s , we realized that we were in the creb , and we were in the clearing design -- which we actually started the company -- to slow forward .
i had written this piece &quot; avatar , &quot; which is the measure of visual effects and computer generated effects in whole new heights , with realistic human expression that had been made by cg , and the main figures should be cg . and the main figures should be cg .
but the trace hit quite well , and people in my company told me that we don &apos;t be able to do that .
so i shifted that up , and i made this other film about the big ship that goes .
the film studio , i sold this as &quot; surfing o and julia on a ship . &quot; it became a love clip , a passionate movie .
but i actually wanted to tear down to the real tour of the titanic .
that &apos;s why i made the film .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know .
but i convinced you , by saying , &quot; we &apos;re going to go to the scock . we film the real race .
we &apos;re going to show it in the opening sequence of the film .
this is very important . it &apos;s a good twist for marketing . &quot;
and i talked to them , to fund an expedition .
sounds crazy . but again , it goes back to the fact that your imagination can create reality .
and then we actually created six months later , a reality where i found myself in a russian dive , four miles under the surface of the north atlantic , and i looked at the real titanic through an idiot .
that wasn &apos;t a movie , no hd , that was real .
so , that really blew me .
and the reconnectedness were enormous . we had to build cameras and light lights and all kinds of things .
and i realized how much these profound spots , a space mission .
well , they were also highly technological and vulnerable .
you go down into these capsule , and you go down into this dark , hostile environment , where no hope is on saving , if you don &apos;t make it yourself .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s just as if i was in a science fiction movie .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
i was very obsessed with studying the deep sea .
anyway , that part of the thing to do with curiosity and science . it was all . it was an adventure . it was an imagination .
and it was an experience that was not able to give me hollywood .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature for which we could create a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i would see outside the window .
at some of the same expeditions , i &apos;ve seen creatures in thermalsources , and sometimes things that i &apos;ve never seen before , sometimes things that have never seen before , and the science of the science , when we saw them , had no words .
so that really blew me up , and i wanted more .
and so i met a little bit unusual .
after success , i said , &quot; okay , i want to put my career as a filmmaker in hollywood and become a full-time researcher for a while . &quot;
and then we started , we came up with the &quot; bismarck , &quot; and they were studying robotic witness .
we have five to go back the titanic .
we took small robots that we built , which was a fiberglass cable .
our intention was to come in and look at the ship of the ship , which was never done before .
no one had ever explored the inner of the race . you had no resources for it , so we developed the technology .
and now i &apos;m sitting on the deck of the titanic , in a diving boat , and i see planks that are quite similar to this , and i know once the band has played there .
and i fly with a little robotic experience through the shipping of the ship .
i actually do it , but my consciousness is within the vehicle .
it felt like i was physically walking inside the boat of the titanic .
this was the most surreal form of a déjetti vu that i ever experienced , because before i got around a corner , i knew what was going to be the same in the light of the vehicle , because i went to film set of film .
the set was a precise copy of the building plans of the ship .
so that was a very strange experience .
it made me realize that this telepresented experience is that you &apos;re using robotic stimuli and so on your own consciousness in these other forms of existence .
it was really profound .
and maybe a little bit of looking at what might happen in a few decades , if you have sketg-bodies to do something or to do things , in all kinds of post-humanies that i can think of as science fiction .
after these expeditions , we started what we saw down there , really value to learn , for example , these profound shifts , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals . these are kind of alien , but here on earth .
they live with the aid of chemosynthesis .
they &apos;re not based on sunlight based on sunlight as we do .
and this is what you see right next to a 500 degrees centigrade that you can survive there .
at the same time , i became very interested in space science , which was again the science fiction effect from my childhood .
and so i ended up with the people who are interested in space and doing that with nasa , and in the nasa care council , and the right space policies , they drive to russia , go through the mission of the biomedical protocol , and they go off to the international space station .
that was fascinating .
but at the end of it , i was going to take space scientist with us in the deep sea .
i took them to the world , and i gave them access to the world , astrobiologists , planetary scientists , people who were interested in such extreme situations . i took them to take samples and test tools so that they could take samples and test instruments , and so on .
we made documentary movies , but actually , science , more specifically , space science .
so the circle was so closed between my existence as fiction fiction , as a child , and the setting in reality .
i &apos;ve learned a lot in the course of this journey .
i learned a lot about science , but i &apos;m certainly thinking , a director needs to lead , a leader like a ship or something .
but i didn &apos;t understand a lot of leadership before i joined this whale .
because at a certain point , i had to say , &quot; what am i doing here ?
why do i do that ? what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
these stupid films make us not a cash .
we &apos;re just playing the production cost of the production of fame .
all of you think i walked off &quot; titanic &quot; and &quot; avatar , &quot; and i would have shot the seeins somewhere on a beach .
i &apos;ve made all these films , these documentary , for a very small audience .
no fame , no honor , no money . what do you do ?
you &apos;re going to do it for the sake , to the challenge -- and the ocean is the most challenging environment that there is . you &apos;re doing it in the process of discovery , because of the strange connection , that comes when a small group of people create a team .
because we &apos;ve done all this with only 10 to 12 people who have been uninterrupted for years , sometimes we have two to three months back on lake .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing that you have is the warning that you have in front of each other , because you have a problem that you can &apos;t explain any other .
if you go back to land and say , &quot; we had to do it , the fiberglass , the sound of sound , and the whole technology , and the technology , and the difficulty , the human performance , if you &apos;re working on the sea , you can &apos;t explain somebody else .
there &apos;s a connection , a mutual respect .
so when i got back to turn my next film , &quot; avatar , &quot; i tried to use the same leadership style , which is that you respect your team and respect respect to respect .
it really changed the dynamics .
so i stood back with a little team on unfamiliar terrain , and we made &quot; avatar &quot; with a new technology that didn &apos;t have before .
very exciting .
an enormous challenge .
and we became a real family for a four-and-a-half years .
it changed my way to make movies completely .
there were people who said , we had this ocean creatures really well , and on the planet pandora .
for me , it was more of a unified way to do my job , the real process that changed the outcome .
so what can we do from all of this ?
what lessons do we learn ?
i think first is the curiosity .
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
our imagination is a force that can even create a reality .
and the warning of your team is more important than all of the lorgurt of this world .
to me , young filmmakers who say , &quot; give me a advice like that . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t stand yourself .
they &apos;ll get others for you . don &apos;t do it yourself , don &apos;t drink yourself . but take risks on you . &quot;
nasa has a favorite sentence : &quot; fail is not an alternative . &quot;
but in the art and studying failure , it has to be an alternative , because there is a trust of trust .
not an important underending , the innovation was asked by no risk .
you &apos;ve got to be ready to take risks .
this is the idea that i &apos;d like to leave you with on the way . failure is really an alternative , but fear is not . thank you .
today , i &apos;m talking to you about energy and climate .
and this may surprise you , because my full-time engagement at the foundation is mainly about vaccines and seeds to make things that we have to invent and provide to allow the poorest two billion a better life .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , and even more importantly than anyone else on the planet .
climate change is that their savers are not going to grow over many years ; it &apos;s too much or too small . things are going to change their fragile environment .
that leads to hunger . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to unrest .
so , a climate change becomes horrible for you .
also , energy epic for you is very important .
the fact is , if you could only decrease from one thing to the price of poverty , energy is more effective at far .
well , energy epic is over time .
in fact , the progress society is based on energy advances .
the cohlerevolution is driving the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a very rapid case in electricity , and therefore we have refrigerators , we can create modern materials and so many things .
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but , if we reduce the price -- let &apos;s cut the price -- let &apos;s cut on a new barrier and that barrier is related to co2 .
co2 warys the planet and the equation for co2 is actually quite clear .
they interanimate co2 , which leads to temperature increases and has a few very negative consequences , and effects on the weather and maybe worse , the indirect consequence that the natural ecosystems can &apos;t adapt to the change , and all these systems are going together .
now , the exdue context between a carbon rise and the result of temperature change and where the other consequences are , there &apos;s some unknowments , but not very many .
and there &apos;s certainly no clarity about how bad these consequences are , but they will be extremely bad .
i asked the top scientists several times , &quot; do we really have to come down close to zero ?
isn &apos;t half the or a quarter ? &quot;
the answer is , until we get close , the temperature will go further .
so it &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different to say , we have a three-foot truck , which has to be under a three-foot bridge , and you can sort of push it underneath .
this has to go down to zero .
well , we &apos;re following a lot of carbon dioxide every year , over 26 billion tons .
every american is about 20 tons . people from poor countries , less than one .
in average , it &apos;s about five tons of everyone on the planet .
and somehow we have to create changes that go down to zero .
it &apos;s gone up so far .
just different economic changes have influenced it , and we need to go to reducing the rise of the rise , and to a reduction to zero .
this equation has four factors . it &apos;s a little double . they have this thing on the left -- co2 , which you want to bring towards zero and that will depend by the number of people in average , the average energy for every human being , the average energy for every service and the co2 .
so let &apos;s take a factor of every factor of each factor and think about how we get this on zero .
probably one of these numbers has to come very close to zero .
now that &apos;s basic algebra , but let &apos;s go through it .
first we have the population .
today , 6.8 billion people live .
and it &apos;s about nine billion to move on to nine billion .
if we were very successful with new vaccine users , health care and reproduction medicine , we could reduce that 10 percent to 15 percent , but now we see a slope of 1.3 .
the second factor is the services we use .
this includes all the food we eat , clothing , television , heating .
these are very good things , and the poverty continue to address these services almost every one on the planet .
it &apos;s great that this number is rising .
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we may be able to do and use less use , but in average , that number is going to rise every year , and so much more than double , the number of services that are being put together .
here &apos;s a very fundamental service . is there any time at home , so you can read the homework ?
and these students don &apos;t have it , so they go out and read their school tasks under the street .
now , efficiency , e , energy per service , there &apos;s finally good news .
we have something that &apos;s not rising .
because of different successes in the light sector , through other types of oypers , through new methods in building , there are many services that allow energy to reduce some of them to reduce 90 percent .
in other services , like the making of thin resources , 105 squared : 05 : 56,000 -- -- 00 5 : 45 : 05 , or air traffic , is very much smaller for improvement .
in total , if we &apos;re optimistic , we may have a reduction for a factor of three or maybe even a factor of six .
but in the first three factors , we &apos;ve gone from 26 billion to perhaps best 13 billion tons , and that &apos;s simply not enough !
so let &apos;s look at the fourth factor -- and this is going to be a key thing -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 that is emitted per unit of energy .
the question is whether you can get that on zero .
if you burn coal : no .
if you burn natural gas : no .
almost every manufacturing method for electricity , today co2 , except renewables and nuclear energy .
so , what we need to do on a global level is to create a new system .
we need energy wonders .
now , if i use the word &quot; wonders , &quot; i don &apos;t mean the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
the internet and its services is a miracle .
people here have contributed to the development of many of these wonders .
there &apos;s not a deadline normally that you need a miracle to a certain date .
normally you &apos;re just wrong , and some of you are not going to come .
but in this case , we have to live and get a miracle in very short time .
now , i wondered , how can i really get this ?
is there a natural illustration , a demonstration , the idea of the people here ?
i remember last year when i got mosquitos and somehow liked the people .
the idea became really tangible for them , you know , there are people who live with mosquitos .
so for energy , this was one .
i decided that this was going to make a free-fly from fireflies to the environment here .
so here &apos;s a couple natural fireflies .
you agree with me that you don &apos;t even join it . you probably don &apos;t even leave the glass .
well , there are all kinds of playful solutions like this , but they all don &apos;t bring much .
we need solutions , either one or multiple that have an unimaginable scaling and unimaginable ability , and even though there are many directions where people are looking for them , i really see five that can afford these big demands .
i &apos;ve left a time , geothermal , fusion and biopower .
you might have a modern contribution , and if you do better than i expect , that would be great , but my core statement here is that we have to work on all those five , because we can &apos;t give up the problems because they all have significant problems .
let &apos;s first look at the burning fossil fuels first of either coal or natural gas .
what you have to do there may seem to be simple , but it &apos;s not . you have to do all the co2 that comes from the burning of the cockroach , you get under pressure , under pressure and you hope it stays there .
there are a bunch of mushroom projects that can do this on a 60 percent -- 80 percent level , but to get it on 100 percent very difficult , and an agreement for the lacro of the co2 , is a big challenge , but the biggest problem here is a big challenge .
who will make it secure ?
who can guarantee what literally many billion times larger than any kind of waste you can imagine from nuclear and other things ?
this is a lot of volume .
so this is a tough crane .
next : nuclear energy .
it also has three big problems , and the cost , especially in high-regulation countries , the question of security that you really feel that nothing can go wrong , despite the human being , that the fuel is not used for weapons .
and what do you do with the waste ?
because even though it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concerns .
so three very difficult problems that maybe are soluble , and that &apos;s why you should work .
the last three , i &apos;ve summarized .
it &apos;s the renewables that are often called a lot .
and also , even though it &apos;s great , you don &apos;t need a fuel -- you have some subsections .
one is the energy savings that makes these technologies dramatically dramatically than the power of power .
this is energy sector , you &apos;re talking about many square miles , thousands of times more land than a normal plant .
and it also underends these vents .
the sun doesn &apos;t seem to be all day , it doesn &apos;t seem every day , and also the wind doesn &apos;t go all day .
so , if you depend on these sources , you have to have a way to have the energy in times if you &apos;re not available .
so there &apos;s a big amount of price here . there are challenges in transmission , and if we say that , for example , the energy source is outside the country , they don &apos;t just need to deal with the risk that the energy from where it comes from .
and there &apos;s the campproblem .
and to show the dimension , i have all kinds of batteries that are made , looking for cars , computers , mobile phones , glops , for everything . and that &apos;s what i found with the amount of electronic energy that uses the world to use less than 10 minutes of total energy .
so we need a big breakthrough here , something that will be 100 better than the approaches to the time .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not so easy .
this is what happens when you try to get these subcursor sources to say about 20 percent -- 30 percent of the consumer .
if you want to support yourself 100 percent , you need an incredible beautiful battery .
now , where are we going to go , what is the right approach ?
one of the manhattan project ? how do we get to the target ?
what we need is many companies working on it . hundreds of them .
in each of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
in many , they &apos;ll say , they &apos;re crazy ! that &apos;s good .
i think there are many , many people already engaged there .
bill big has several companies , one called esolar who has the great solar thermal technologies .
vindie khosla invested in dozens of companies doing the great stuff and interesting opportunities , and i try to support it .
nathan myhrvold and i fund a company that , perhaps surprisingly , is the nuclear approach .
there are some innovations in nuclear space ; modular , liquid .
the development has stopped in this industry a few times ago , so it &apos;s not a great surprise that some good concepts are around .
the terramatic concept means that instead of a part of the uranium , one percent , the u235 , we decided to burn the 99 percent , the u238 .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , you &apos;ve been thinking about it for a long time , but you &apos;ve never been able to simulate any reasonable , whether it &apos;s going to work , but since it &apos;s modern supercomputer , you can simulate it and see that , yes , with the right materialian , it looks like it &apos;s working .
and because you burn these 99 percent , it &apos;s very much better .
in fact , you burn the trash , and you can actually use the waste of these reactors as a sales .
instead of breaking your head on it , you just burn it . a great thing .
the uranium is used by graduate age , a little bit like a candle .
you can see that it &apos;s a kind of column , often as a passenger wave reactor .
that really solves the fuel problem .
here &apos;s a picture of a place in kentucky .
so this is the waste , the 99 percent . you have the part that &apos;s burned today , so it &apos;s called the bride urine .
the motors for hundreds of years .
and if you make ocean water cheap and just film , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet .
you know , there are many challenges , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to move forward .
let &apos;s think about how we measure our success .
how should our testimony look ?
well , let &apos;s go to the destination that we have to get and talk about the interstep .
many talks about a 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
it &apos;s really important that we get there .
the rest of the 20 percent will be produced in poor countries , and still something that is agriculture , and hopefully it &apos;s going to be clean and cement until then .
so , to reach these 80 percent , the industrial states , including countries like china , are completely redeveloping their electricity .
the other note says if we &apos;re using the zero emissions technology , whether it &apos;s in all developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest .
that &apos;s great .
this is going to be a key element of this subject .
if we go back from there , how should the 2020 mark signs look ?
it should contain the two elements again .
we should use the effects of productivity to get a reduction on the way , and the less we disweigh , the less we will be the carbon , and also the temperature .
but in fact , this note is the things that we &apos;re doing , which are not completely reductions to the big reductions , just the same , or even a little less important than the other , which is the speed of innovation for these breakthroughs .
we have to measure these breakthroughs with full gas , and we can measure that in corporate numbers , in corporate numbers and regulations change .
there are lots of great books to this topic .
the al gore book &quot; we have the choice &quot; and david mckays , &quot; the smithenergy transplant . &quot;
they really go through it and create a frame where this can be discussed wide , because we need to support all sides .
there &apos;s a lot that needs to come together .
that &apos;s a wish .
a very specific desire that we invent this technology .
if you just give me a wish for the next 50 years , i could pick the president , a vaccine , and i love that wish , or i could choose that wish , which is , &quot; check me . &quot;
this has the largest impact .
if we don &apos;t get that wish , the digging between the long-term and short-term people are getting terrible between the united states and china , between poor and rich , and almost all of these lives will be much worse .
so what do we need to do ?
what kind of action i do ?
we need to use more research for more research .
when countries come to places like copenhagen , they shouldn &apos;t just talk about co2 .
they should discuss this innovation strategy , and they would be shocked by the ridiculously small ones that have spent these innovative approaches .
we need market incentives , carbon incentives , cap &amp; amp ; trade something that creates a price signal .
we need to spread the message .
we need to rationalize dialogue , and also the things that are being done by the government .
it &apos;s an important wish , but i think we can fulfill it .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you . just to understand terraptpower a little better -- first , can you give us an idea of scale of this investment ?
bill gates : to do the simulation on a supercomputer , to get all the great scientists , what we &apos;ve done , we only need some 10 million . and even if we &apos;ve tested our materials in a russian reactor to make sure that it works , you only have a hundred million .
the hard step is to build the first reactor , to find another billion , which is ordinary and the place of the first one .
once the first finished , when he &apos;s walking like this , it &apos;s all very clear , because the economy , the power of energy , is so different from nuclear energy as we know it .
to understand the right thing , which means to build deep in the ground , almost like a vertical column nuclear fuel , this kind of thing required , and then the process starts , and then the process is working on the top ?
bg : exactly . today you &apos;ve got to refill the reactor , so there &apos;s a lot of people who can go wrong . this thing where you can open it and stuff -- that &apos;s not good !
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can fill it for 60 years -- think about a column -- that you bury , without all the complexity .
and it &apos;s sitting there , and it burns 60 years and then it &apos;s done .
a nuclear reactor that gives itself a solution to the garbage .
bg : yeah . now , what happens to the waste : you can let it sit -- there &apos;s a lot less waste with this method -- then take it and paste it into the next reactor and burn it .
and we start by taking the waste , which is already there , which is in these refrigerating basin or dry fish in the reactors . that &apos;s our starting fuel .
so , what was a problem for these reactors that was a problem , which is what we &apos;re going to put in our camps and it will dramatically reduce the waste of garbage during this process .
but as you talk to different people in the world about these possibilities .
where is the biggest interest , what really do you do ?
bg : well , we didn &apos;t set up to a place , and there &apos;s a lot of more interesting things for everything called the nuclear &quot; nuclear &quot; in the name . there &apos;s big interest and the people of the company in russia , india , china -- i was here and talked about how to fit the energy agenda .
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have something in the direction .
this is a variation of one thing that was made .
this is an important step forward , but it &apos;s like a faster reactor and some countries built this , so everyone that has done a quick reactor , a candidate for our first .
in your mind , time frame and probability is something really to call ?
bg : well , we need one of these scaling , current things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to invent and then spend 20 years to use .
this is sort of the deadline that shows us the environmental models that we need to take .
and , you know , terrapower , if everything goes well , and that &apos;s a big wish , could keep it easy .
and luckily , there are dozens of companies today , and we need hundreds and hundreds of people that work as their approaches , working for their pilots , can provide it .
and it would be best if there were many , because then you could use a mixture .
anyway , we need a solution .
the great possible breakthroughs , is this the biggest thing you know ?
bg : a energy breakthrough is the most important thing .
it would have been without the environmental imperative , but the power is so much more important .
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
you know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as this , but there &apos;s the modular method , which is another approach .
there &apos;s a liquid reactor that seems to be a little difficult , but maybe they say that about us .
and so there &apos;s different , but the beautiful thing about it is that an ancient molecule has a million times so much energy as one , we say , a coal molecule , and therefore , if you can deal with the problems and the cost , it &apos;s the potential to scale the land and other things .
if that doesn &apos;t work , what ?
do we need to leverage critical measures to try and keep the temperature stable ?
bg : when you get into this situation , it &apos;s as if you &apos;re eating too much , and you stand in front of a heart attack . what do you do ? you might need a heart surgery or something .
there &apos;s a research strategy that &apos;s called the geoengineering , which is related to various techniques to delay warming , so that we will run 20 or 30 years longer to run together .
this is just an insurance method .
you hope we don &apos;t need that .
some people say , you &apos;re not supposed to work on insurance because you might be lazy , so you keep eating , because you know that you &apos;re going to save the heart surgery .
i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s smart if you take the importance of this problem in front of you , but there &apos;s now a disengineering course in geoengineering about whether things get faster , if things get faster than we expect .
climaskepler : did you have one or two sentences to convince you ?
bg : well , unfortunately , the skeptics in very different camps .
those who do scientific arguments are very little .
do you say there are negative effects that have to do with the clouds that move ?
there are very , very few things you can say at all , which is a chance in a million .
the main problem here is like aids .
you make the mistake now , and you pay a lot later for it .
and that &apos;s why the idea is , now , if you have all kinds of urgent problems to invest in something that you only have later -- and that &apos;s where the investment report isn &apos;t necessarily the worst scenario , and there are people in the rich world , looking at it , saying , okay , that &apos;s not a big drama .
the fact is that this uncertainty should make us worry .
but my dream here is that , if you can make it economic , and at the same time , the co2 will say , &quot; okay , it doesn &apos;t interest me , because i &apos;m going to accept it because it &apos;s cheaper than the previous method . &quot;
and that would be their answer to the byo lomborg argument , that if you use all these time and energy to solve the co2 problem , all the other goals suffer from suffering all the other goals , the poverty increases , reducing malaria and so on .
bg : well , the real spending for research -- let &apos;s say the u.s. should spend 10 billion a year than they do today -- that &apos;s not so dramatic .
it shouldn &apos;t suffer other things .
you get too large sums of money , and you can talk to some reasonable people , if you have something that &apos;s not economically , and try to fund it , for me , most of the waste .
because , you know , you &apos;re very short in front of a free breakthrough and funded only the learning curve . i think we should try more things that have the potential to be very much cheaper .
if the bottom line you get is a very high energy epic , you can only keep the rich game .
i mean , every one of us here could spend five times as much for our energy without changing its lifestyle .
but for the bottom two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
and even lomborg thinks .
his new mavity is now , &quot; why don &apos;t research be discussed anymore ? &quot;
he &apos;s still associated with his former stories , associated with the skepticism camp , but he understood that this is a very lonely group and therefore he &apos;s taking the research argument .
and that &apos;s a thought that i think is appropriate .
research , it &apos;s just as crazy as the supporting .
bill , i think i &apos;m talking for almost everyone here when i say , i really hope you will be true . thank you very much .
bg : thank you .
a few years ago , at ted , peter skillman hired a design competition called &quot; the marshmallow challenging . &quot;
the idea is pretty simple . four teams have to get the biggest possible structure with 20 spaghetti , about 1m tape , about three feet and a marshmallow .
the marshmallow must be on top .
and , even though it seems really simple , it really is really hard , because it makes people work very quickly .
and so i thought that this is an interesting idea , and i turned it into a design workshop .
it was a huge success .
since then , i &apos;ve been doing about 70 workshops around the world , with students , developing developers and architects , even with ctos of fortune , and there &apos;s something about this problem , which is the depth of the nature of collaboration and i want to share some of them .
usually most people are starting to orient themselves on the task .
you talk about it , you &apos;re thinking about how it &apos;s going to look , you &apos;re doing it .
then you invest in planning and organization . you sketch and put spaghetti .
they invest a lot of their time in the building all the time .
and finally , soon before you don &apos;t have time , someone takes the marshmallow and you put it on the top of it , you get a step back and you say , &quot; ta-da ! &quot; you admire your work .
but then what happens , almost always happens , is that the &quot; ta-da &quot; becomes a &quot; uh-oh &quot; , because the weight of the marshmallow is that the whole thing is going to bend and fall down .
there &apos;s a series of people who have much more &quot; uh-oh &quot; moments than others are , and under the worst are fresh .
they lie , they cheat , they &apos;re confused , and they &apos;re actually producing racking shapes .
and of course , there are teams that have a lot more &quot; ta-da &quot; shapes , and under the best are fresh graduates of the child .
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
as peter said , they don &apos;t just produce the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
what you might ask is , how does this happen ? why ? what about those ?
and peter says , &quot; none of the kids spent time in the head of spaghetti gmbh . &quot;
they don &apos;t invest time in power combat .
but there &apos;s another reason .
and that is that bwl students were trained to find the right plan , ok .
and then to realize it .
what happens when you put the marshmallow on the top , you don &apos;t have time and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
what children do differently is they start with the marshmallow and building prototypes , successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow on the top , so that they have more times the opportunity to fix the opportunity .
constructing these kinds of collaboration as the core of a iterative act .
and with every attempt , the kids get immediately feedback and what doesn &apos;t work .
so the performance of working with prototypes is to work much -- but let &apos;s see how different teams act .
the average for most of them is about 500,000 inches , bwl students , half of them do something more , but not much , child children are better than the adults .
who is most successful ?
architects and engineers , luckily .
1m is the highest thing i saw .
and why ? because they understand triangles and self-replication geometric patterns are the key to build on stable structures .
ceo is about average . but here it gets interesting .
you put an exitive administrator on the team , you become significantly better .
it &apos;s incredible . you &apos;re looking around , and you see , &quot; this team will win . &quot;
you can predict that . why is this ?
because they have special skills of processing .
they lead the process , they understand it .
and this team , which is looking at the work , the performance of the team is significantly improving .
specialized skills and processing skills and their combination leads to success .
if you have 10 teams , the typical run , you get about six , the more stable structures .
i tried something interesting .
i thought , well , we &apos;re going to bring the pokery .
so i offered 10,000 dollars of software for the winner .
what do you think happened with these design students ?
what was the result ?
this is what happened . not a team had a stable structure .
if anyone had built an eight-inch construction , he would have carried the price home .
so , isn &apos;t it interesting that high competition have a strong effect ?
we started this exercise with the same students .
what do you think happened now ?
now they understood the benefits of the prototype .
so from the same , bad team of one under the best .
they produced the highest construction in the moment .
there &apos;s so profound lessons for us , about nature of drive and success .
you might ask , why would someone actually invest a screenlow challenge ?
the reason is , i &apos;m helping digital tools and processes to help teams , cars , video games and visual tso .
and what the marshmallow is doing is it helps you identify the assumptions .
because frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge provides a common experience , a common language , or foundations , to build the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , this so simple exercise .
and those of you who are interested in that can visit marshmallow challenlets .
it &apos;s a blog where you see how to build the marshmallow .
there &apos;s a pac-by-step manual there .
they find crazy examples from all around the world , how people optimize the system and concurating it .
there are also world leaders .
and the base lesson , i think , is actually the construction of sport .
it requires that we all put our senses on the task , and we &apos;re using our thinking , how our emotions and our do , in the challenge , the challenge of us .
and sometimes a little prototype of this experience is everything that takes us from a &quot; uh-oh &quot; to a &quot; uh-oh &quot; moment .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you .
we do as if we have a machine here .
a big machine , a cool ted machine , and that &apos;s a time machine .
and everyone in this room needs to be in .
and you can go to the past , you can go to the future ; you can &apos;t stay here and now .
and i wonder what they would choose because i asked my friends recently , and they all wanted to go to the past .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back to the time before there was cars or twitter or america , &quot; america . &quot;
i don &apos;t know .
i believe you &apos;re somehow drawn to nostalgia .
and i understand that .
i &apos;m not part of that group , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to go to the past , and that &apos;s not because i &apos;m a adventgler .
it &apos;s because opportunities are not going back on this planet , they go forward .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go to the future .
this is the greatest time that ever existed on this planet , regardless of scale : health , wealth , mobility , opportunities , etc .
there &apos;s never been a time like this .
my great-great-grandparents died as they were 60 .
my grandparents pushed this number on 70gers .
my parents are 80 on the heel .
so there should be a nine on the beginning of my death number .
but it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
a child who is born in new delhi can expect as long as the richest man on the world 100 years ago .
think about it . this is an incredible fact .
and why is that ?
smallpox . smallpox killed billions of people on this planet .
they developed the demographics of the earth in a way that no war ever managed .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
we &apos;ve committed it . puff .
in the rich world , diseases exist for millions of us only one generation , hardly yet .
diphtry , roman , child paralysis ...
does anyone know what that is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , are successes of science .
and from my view , the scientific method is to try and see if it works , it changes if it doesn &apos;t do it , one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
so that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , it &apos;s all the good news , because there are some other problems , and they &apos;re often mentioned .
and one of them is , despite all of our achievements , there is a billion people going hungry in the world every day .
this number goes up , and it goes very fast , and that &apos;s embarrassing .
and not only that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to redefine this world .
drinking water , urble land , rainforests , oil , gas : they disappear , and that &apos;s soon , and if we don &apos;t go out from this chaos innovators .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that will feed billions of people without the country that they live on .
i think we can power this world with energy that they don &apos;t at the same time .
i think that &apos;s really , and no , that &apos;s not a wonderful thing .
but this is holding me awake at night -- one of the things that i keep awake at night , and we &apos;ve never used scientific progress as well as now .
and we &apos;ve never been able to put it sensible , as we can today .
we &apos;re at the threshold to incredible , amazing events on many areas , and yet , i really think we &apos;d have to go back hundreds and 300 years before the enlightenment to find a time where we &apos;ve been fighting progress in more front than now .
people agree in their faith , and that &apos;s the way you can &apos;t release them .
not even the truth will be free .
and listen , everybody has a right to think about his mind ; even a right thing to do .
but you know what you don &apos;t quite have ?
they don &apos;t quite have their own facts . &apos; bye , they don &apos;t have .
and i took a while to figure it out .
about a decade ago , i wrote an article about vaccinations for the new yorker , a little article .
and i was amazed to come up with resistance to the resistance of what the most effective thing is in human health history .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i just did what i always do , i wrote an article and went on .
and soon i wrote an article about genetic food .
same thing , only bigger .
people played crazy .
so i also wrote an article about this , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that would be &quot; frankenfood , &quot; why they thought that molecules were going to move around a certain kind of reference to the area of nature .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i kept on .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
we type , we rich , we eat , that &apos;s okay .
but this article made me worry , and i couldn &apos;t find out why , and finally i found it out .
and that &apos;s because these fanatics that made me feel crazy at all .
these were retested people , educated people , decent people .
they were just like the people in this room .
and that brought me so confused .
but then i thought , you know what , we &apos;re honest .
we &apos;re at a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship for progress as we used to .
we &apos;re talking about twin .
we &apos;re talking ironic about this , with little objections of this : &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , there &apos;s reasons for that , and i think we know what the reasons are .
we have trust in institutions , authority , and sometimes in science , and there &apos;s no reason why it shouldn &apos;t be .
you can just call a few names and people will understand .
chernobyl , bhopal , the challenger , vioxx , mass destruction , the u.s. presidential election 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with people we thought they were always right . so be skeptical .
ask questions , demand the evidence , demand them .
don &apos;t take anything like that .
but now , if you have to get the evidence , you have to accept this evidence , and we &apos;re not good at it .
and i can say that we &apos;re now in an epidemic of fear , as i &apos;ve never seen , and hopefully never seen again .
about 12 years ago , a story was published , a terrible story that the autism epidemic was dealing with by the masders , mushrimp , and roman vaccine .
very scary .
the studies were done to see whether that was true .
the study of studies should be done ; that &apos;s a serious issue .
the data came in .
the data came in the united states , from the u.k. , from sweden , from canada , and they were all the same , no correlation , no connection , no connection .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference . it doesn &apos;t make any difference , because we believe in anecdotes , we believe what we see , what makes us think that we feel really .
we don &apos;t think of a bunch of documents from a government who gives us data , and i understand that we all do .
but you know what ?
the result of this was catastrophic .
catastrophic hal because of this fact : the united states is one of the only countries in the world where the immunities are falling down .
this is scandal and we should be ashamed .
it &apos;s terrible .
what happened is we could do that .
well , i understand that . i do .
because anybody here ?
has one in the audience ever saw anyone die of masses ?
it &apos;s not very often happening .
it &apos;s not happening in this country at all , but 64 times in the world last year .
these are a lot of deaths by masders , 20 an hour .
but because this is not happening here , we can put it in denial , and people like jenny mccarthy can go around and face messages and illiteracy of politicians like oprah and larry king live .
and they can do that because they don &apos;t connect cause and corties .
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be equal , but almost never the same .
and that &apos;s something we need to learn , and very quickly .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .
he liberates us from one of the worst people in humanity .
no fear , no source , child paralysis , puff , disappeared .
the guy in the middle not so much .
he &apos;s called paul offit .
he &apos;s just developed a couple of other people &apos;s vaccine vaccine .
he can save the lives of 400- , 500,000 children a year in the developing world .
pretty good , right ?
well , that &apos;s good , except that paul &apos;s walking around and talking about vaccines and says , how valuable they are , and that people should just stop shooting .
and that &apos;s what he actually says .
so paul is a terrorist .
when paul speaks to a public public , he can &apos;t say without armed guards .
he gets calls at home because people like to tell him that they know where to go to school .
and why ? because paul made a vaccine .
i don &apos;t need to say that , but vaccines are unprofitable .
if you keep it , the diseases go back , terrible diseases , and that &apos;s happening right now .
we now have masgles in this country .
and that &apos;s getting worse , and pretty soon kids will die again because that &apos;s just a question of numbers .
and they &apos;re not only going to die of masders .
what about a child paralysis ? do we . why not ?
a comet of me wrote a couple of weeks ago , and i said , &quot; i &apos;m a little to step . &quot;
nobody has ever said that before .
she wouldn &apos;t vaccinate her child against her paralysis , no one .
fa .
why ? because we don &apos;t have a child paralysis . and you know what ?
we had no child paralysis in this country yesterday .
now , i don &apos;t know , maybe this morning , somebody got into a plane , and i just go to los angeles , right now , it &apos;s about ohio .
and in a few hours , he &apos;s a car , and he picks up a car , and he comes to long beach , and he gets one of these fantastic ted cattle tonight .
and he doesn &apos;t know he &apos;s infected with a paralyzing disease , and we don &apos;t know , because that &apos;s how the world works now .
this is the planet that we live on . don &apos;t do it as if it &apos;s not .
we love to wash ourselves in lies . we love it .
did you take all of your vitamins tomorrow ?
echinacea , a small antioxidanzation , which helps you the jumps .
i know you &apos;ve done that because half of americans do it every day .
they take the stuff , and they take alternative cure , and it doesn &apos;t make any difference how often we find that they are useless .
the data shows it all the time .
they burn their urine . they almost never do .
this is okay , you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark harbor numbers .
i agree with you completely .
dark ur. dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
now i think i understand -- we hate the pharmaceutical industry .
we hate too strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
and we should not . our healthcare system is mies .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely amazing to us , and it &apos;s a souger itself .
so we &apos;re going forward , and where are we running ?
we &apos;re running into the arms of placebo industry .
this is great . i love the placebo industry .
but you know , this is really serious , because the stuff is crap , and we give billions of dollars to it .
and i have all kinds of props here .
kone of them -- labko , fraud , echinacea , was acai , because i don &apos;t even know what that is , but we &apos;re giving billions of dollars to do it .
and you know what ? if i say that , people say , and say , &quot; what does it take you ? let &apos;s do what you want .
that &apos;s how they feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? you &apos;re wrong .
because it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s the minister of health , who says , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m not going to accept the evidence of my experts , &quot; or any cancer force , who wants to treat his patient with caffe .
if you go to this path where faith and magic is replacing the evidence and science , you get to a place where you don &apos;t want to be .
they get to thabo mbeki in south africa .
he brought 400,000 people to the people , because he was that red bees , it was also a lot more efficient and lemon oil than anti-antiretroviral drugs , which we know that they can take the course of aids .
hundreds of thousands of unfinished deaths in a country that will be worse than any other one of this disease .
please don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences .
they have them . they have them .
now , the world &apos;s highest epidemic , where we &apos;re right now , is this absurde struggle between the fear of the people and the bio-elite .
this is an igram debate . it has to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
this is ideology , not science .
everything that we eat , every branch , every branch , every branch , has been changed by the people .
you know , there was no mandates in paradise .
there was no cantalousaurus melons .
there was no christmas trees . we did it all .
we did it in the last 11,000 years .
and some of them have worked and don &apos;t work .
we &apos;ve gone down , which doesn &apos;t work .
now we can do it more carefully , and of course there are risks . but we can do something like vitamin a in rice , and the stuff can help millions of people to increase their lives .
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
i don &apos;t have to say that .
we dismiss food .
why do we do that ?
now , what i &apos;m always hearing is , too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , monoculture , we don &apos;t want to deal with a thing that &apos;s wrong .
we don &apos;t want firms to be patented .
we don &apos;t want firms to have seeds .
and you know what my answer to all this is ?
yeah , they &apos;re right . let &apos;s fix that .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge food problem , but that &apos;s not science .
this has nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s right , morality , patent stuff .
you know that science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work , but the idea that we should not allow science to do , because we &apos;re afraid of doing a real dead , and it holds millions of people off the ground .
you know , in the next 50 years we will have to grow 70 percent more food than at the moment . 70 percent .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
shame . shame .
they need that , and we don &apos;t give it to you .
and why ? genetic food .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this sparred stuff , like maniok .
maniok is something that a half a billion people eat .
it &apos;s about a mapping .
it &apos;s just a bunch of calories . it &apos;s mies .
it doesn &apos;t have nutrients ; it doesn &apos;t have a protein , and scientists are building all this .
and then people could eat the food and they wouldn &apos;t be blind .
you wouldn &apos;t starve , you know what ?
that would be nice . it wouldn &apos;t be chez , but it would be nice .
and all i can say is , why do we fight this ?
i mean , let &apos;s say , why do we fight this ?
because we don &apos;t want to push genes around ?
it &apos;s not about pulling genes around . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our indog on greater food , better food , unique food .
it &apos;s not about rice crisis , it &apos;s about getting people alive , and it becomes the highest time to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we don &apos;t do that , if we keep doing that as far as we do , i think we don &apos;t want to be guilty , high-tech colonialism .
there &apos;s no other description of what &apos;s happening here .
it &apos;s self-addictive ; it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s not worthy , and we have to really stop it .
so after this incredibly funny conversation , you might want to say , &quot; do you want to go into these ridiculous periods of time and the future ? &quot;
anyway , that &apos;s what i want to do .
right now , it &apos;s in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can put this time machine on everything we want .
we can move them where we want to move them , and we &apos;ll move them there , where we want to .
we have to lead these conversations , and we need to think , but if we go to the time machine , we &apos;re going to be happy to have that .
i know we can , and as far as i am , it &apos;s something that the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
i &apos;ve been interested in the placebo effect for the placebo effect , and it may seem strange that a magician is interested in this , because , you know , you &apos;re looking at it as i am , &quot; a deception that &apos;s going to get something to do when someone believes enough . &quot;
in other words , sugar pills have shown a measurable effect , the placebo effect , and that &apos;s because the person thinks what happens to her is a pharmaceutical or a kind of ... in the pain of it , there is a pharmaceutical or a kind of ... in pain management , for example , there are when the patient believes enough .
a deception becomes something , because someone agrees it .
so we also want to understand each other , i want to show you a very basic , very simple magic trick .
and i &apos;m going to show you how he works . this is a trick that &apos;s been in every magic book for the 1950s for the 1950s .
i learned it from cub scout magic &apos;s magic in the 1970s .
i &apos;m going to do it for you and then explain it .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i explain it .
so , look what happens .
the knife you can study , my hand , you can study .
i &apos;m going to just hold the knife in my shit .
i &apos;ll return my sleeves .
and to make sure that nothing in my sledge or out of it , i &apos;m just going to push my wrist right here .
in this way , you can see that no one &apos;s going to move anything . as long as i push here , nothing can go into my sledge or come out .
and the goal is very simple .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully , if everything goes well , the knife is held through my blog physical magnetism .
it &apos;s actually so clear to his place that i can shake it without the knife down .
nothing walks into my sleevor or comes out , no labels , and you can study everything .
ta-da !
now , this is a trick that i often teach young kids who are interested in magic , because you can learn a lot about deception when you look closely , even though it &apos;s a very simple trick .
probably a lot of you here in the room know this trick .
it works like this .
i think the knife in my hand .
i say i &apos;m going to conclude my wrist to make sure that nothing in my sledge or out , and that &apos;s a lie .
the reason i summarize my wrist is that it is the real secret in the illusion of illusion .
because at the moment , where i turn my hand away from you , so you &apos;re looking at it from the back , that finger is moving here , my time finger , just from where he was so steep .
great trick ?
there &apos;s somebody sitting there who had no childhood .
so , he &apos;s here . right .
and when i turn around , the finger changes its position .
and now you could talk about why this is a deception , why you don &apos;t realize that there &apos;s only three fingers down here : because the mind and the way it works information , it doesn &apos;t count one , two , three , but it &apos;s as a group .
but it &apos;s actually not that right now , and then i open my hand .
of course , there &apos;s going to be written , but not through the magnetism of my body , but through a trick finger , which is now there .
and when i close my hand , the same thing happens by turning me back , is hidden through this movement , that the finger moves back again .
i take that hand away . and here &apos;s the knife .
that trick can show you your friends and neighbors . thank you .
now , what did this have to do with the placebo effect ?
one year ago , i read a study that really came right to me .
i &apos;m not a doctor or a researcher , and that &apos;s why it was an amazing thing to me .
this is what it turns out : if you offer a placebo in a white pill , in the form of an archive , it &apos;s just a round , white pill that has a specific effect .
but if you give the shape that you put in the placebo , for example , in a smaller pill , and that blue color and a letter on it is actually measurable .
and that , although none of them -- they &apos;re just sugar pills .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
what ? that really blew me up .
but it turned out that it &apos;s not all .
if you take room , you &apos;re the more effective than any form of any form .
a colored capsule , which is yellow at the end and on the other red , is better than a white capsule .
also the doctors play a role .
a pill twice a day is not as good as three pills -- i can &apos;t remember the exact statistics . i &apos;m sorry .
but the key thing is ...
that also , the doctors play a role .
and the shape is a role .
and if you want to have the ultimate , you have to grab the needle .
right ? a syringe with a more effective -- a few milliliters of a effectiveness substance that you inject a patient .
it creates a very strong picture in your head . it &apos;s very much stronger than a white pill .
this chart is really -- i &apos;m going to show you another time when we have a projector .
so the fact is that the white pill doesn &apos;t seem as good as the blue pill that doesn &apos;t work as well as a capsule that doesn &apos;t work as well as the needle .
and none of it has any really pharmaceutical property , and it &apos;s just our belief in a stronger effect .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
i take something that &apos;s obviously a deception , and let it look real .
we know from the study that you have to grab the needle when it &apos;s supposed to go .
this is a 18 inches of hutneedle . it &apos;s very , very high . and i &apos;m going to give you a little bit of a charming .
this is really my flesh . it &apos;s not damian .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood .
now i &apos;m going to stick this needle into my skin and drive through them until they rewire on the other side .
if you get sick -- if you just fall down in the -- i have a couple of friends last night in the hotel room , and some people i didn &apos;t know , and a woman i didn &apos;t know , and that &apos;s a woman nearly powerful .
so i &apos;m suggesting if you quickly get sick , look for the next 30 seconds , or , you know what , i &apos;m going to do the first marriage part behind here .
you can see it right now , but you can see , if you want .
so , it goes right here , right here , where my meat starts , at the bottom of my arm , i &apos;m just going to get a little bit down .
i &apos;m really sorry . does it make you crazy ?
and just a little bit of a little bit through my skin and on the other side .
now we &apos;re actually in the same situation that we had in the tracks .
about .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
so , i &apos;m going to show you . this is one , two , three , five .
well yeah .
i know what people think when they see this .
they say , &quot; okay , that &apos;s probably not so stupid , and it &apos;s the skin , just to talk to the skin for a few minutes . &quot;
well , then i &apos;ll show you .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and people in the back say , &quot; okay . i didn &apos;t see that right . &quot;
people in the rooms are coming in now .
let me show you from close .
this is really my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood .
this is my flesh , and i can rotate around .
i &apos;m sorry . if you get sick , look away , don &apos;t look .
people back in the back or the ones who later see this video will say , &quot; well , it looks quite impressive , but if it was real , it would be a hole , and it would be really real . &quot;
okay , let me wrap up a little blood for you .
yeah , here it is .
i would usually take out the needle .
i would clean up my arm and show you that there are no wounds .
but i think in this framework here , and with the intent of a deception , i &apos;m going to just make a needle in there , i &apos;m just going to put the needle there and go from the stage .
we &apos;re going to see a couple of times in the next days .
i hope you &apos;ll enjoy it . thank you very much .
everybody &apos;s talking about happiness today .
i have some people who have been published with the number of books that have been published with happiness in the last five years , and they &apos;ve got about 40 , and there &apos;s a lot more .
there &apos;s a tremendous wave of interest in happiness among researchers .
there &apos;s a lot of luck coaching .
everybody would like to make people happier .
but despite all of that tide of work , there are several cognitive ones that sort of make it almost impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk today is becoming mainly by these cognitive ones .
that &apos;s true for salmon , thinking about your own happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists who think about happiness because it turns out that we are so focused as anyone else .
the first of these fall is a dismediate complexity .
it turns out that the word happiness is simply not a useful word because we apply it to too many different things .
i think there &apos;s a certain meaning that we can put it on , but in the big and large , it &apos;s something that we need to give up , and we need to take the complicated view of what well-being is .
the second trap is a change of experience and memory : basically it &apos;s between happy in his life and happy about his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both locked together in the idea of happiness .
and the third is the concentrations illusion , and that &apos;s the very happy fact that we can &apos;t think about a situation that affects well-being without its significance .
i mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
now , i &apos;d like to start with an example of someone who had a question of question , after one of my lectures , who was telling a story .
and then he added , really , really emotional , that has got the whole experience .
but it didn &apos;t .
what it ruined was the memories of the experience .
he had the experience .
he had had 20 minutes of music .
they didn &apos;t count because he had love with a memory ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was all he had to keep .
what really tells us that we might think about ourselves and thinking about other people in the sense of two types of self .
there &apos;s one of the self that lives in the present and the present knows capable of experiencing the past , but basically the present .
it &apos;s the living self , which is the doctor -- you know , when the doctor asks , &quot; does it hurt if i put it here ? &quot;
and then there &apos;s a memory of self , and the memory itself is that , you know , and the story of our life is getting upright , and it &apos;s in denial that the doctor is talking about by saying , &quot; how did you feel last time ? &quot;
or &quot; how was your journey to albania ? &quot; or something like that .
these are two very different units , the living themselves and the memory itself , and the two to be able to be part of the concept of happiness .
now , the memory itself is a storyteller .
and that really begins with a fundamental reaction to our memories -- it starts immediately .
we don &apos;t just tell stories when we &apos;re doing it to tell stories .
our memory tells us stories , which means what we need to think about our experience is a story .
and let &apos;s start miping with one example .
there &apos;s an old study .
these are real patients who are moving to a painful procedure .
i &apos;m not going to go to the details . it &apos;s not painful today , but it was painful than this study was done in the 1990s .
they were asked to cover all the 60 seconds of their pain .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
and they &apos;re asked , &quot; who &apos;s got more suffered ? &quot;
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
patient b clearly suffered more . his gut reflection was longer , and every minute of pain , the patient a had patient b , and more .
but now there &apos;s another question : &quot; how much did these patients think they suffered ? &quot;
and here &apos;s a surprise .
and the surprise is that patient a much worse reminded of the gut had a much worse interpretation than a patient b.
the stories of the gut reflection were different , and because a very important part of the story is how they end .
and none of these stories is very sophisticated or great -- but one of them is that clearly ...
but one of them is clearly worse than the other .
and the one who &apos;s worse is where the pain was at the end of his peak , it &apos;s a bad story .
how do we know ?
because we asked these people for their gut mirror , and also a lot later , &quot; how bad was the whole thing ? &quot;
and she was much worse for a than for b in the memory .
now , this is a direct conflict between the living self and memory itself .
from the living self , b clearly had a bad time .
well , what you could do with patient a , and we actually did clinical experiments , and it &apos;s been done , and it &apos;s done , you could actually reduce the gut of patient a by simply putting the bomb in there with you .
it will lead to the patient , but just a little bit less than before .
and if you do that for a couple of minutes , that the living self is worse , and you &apos;ve done that the memory itself is much better from patient a much better , because the patient has a better story about his experience .
what is a story that draws ?
and that &apos;s true for the stories that provide memory and it &apos;s true for the stories that we invent .
so what a story is drawn to , significant eye look and ends .
they &apos;re very , very important , and in this case , the end .
well , the living self is constantly alive .
it has moments of life , one after another .
and you ask , what happens to these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re always lost .
i mean , most of the eye views of our lives -- and i have the idea -- you know , the psychological present is about three seconds , which means you know , in a life about 600 million of them , there are about 600 million . most of them don &apos;t leave out .
most of them are completely ignored by the remind themselves .
and yet , somehow you get the impression that you should count that what happens during these moments of life is our lives .
it &apos;s the limited resource that we use while we are on this world .
and as we &apos;re going to use it , it seems to be important , but that &apos;s not the story that holds the memory for us .
so we have the memory itself and the living self , and they &apos;re really quite different .
the biggest difference between you is the age of time .
from the living self , if you have a vacation and the second week , the first week is just like the first , then the two-week holiday twice as well as the one-week holiday .
that &apos;s not how it works at all .
for the remind itself , a two-week vacation is barely better than the one-week holiday , because there &apos;s no new memories added .
they didn &apos;t change the story .
and in this way , time is actually the critical variable that &apos;s different from one living self , and time has very little impact on this story .
now , the memory itself makes more than to remember and tell stories .
it &apos;s actually , in fact , making decisions , because if you have a patient who has , let &apos;s have two gut mirrors in two different surgeons , and decide what to choose , then it &apos;s the one who &apos;s going to get the memory that &apos;s going to be the less bad and that &apos;s the surgeon that will be selected .
the living self has no voice in this choice .
in fact , we don &apos;t choose between experience . we choose between memories .
and even if we think about the future , we don &apos;t usually think of our future as experiences .
we think about our future as a prediction of memories .
and in fact , you can look at this , you know , as a tyranny of the remember self , and you can think of it yourself as one , which is kind of like the living self through experience that doesn &apos;t need the living themselves .
i &apos;ve got the impression that if we &apos;re doing a holiday that &apos;s very often the case , that means we &apos;re doing a holiday in the service of memory itself .
and that &apos;s a little hard to justify , i think .
i mean , how much do we get from our memories ?
this is one of the explanations that &apos;s been given for the dominance self .
and if i think about it , i think of a vacation that we &apos;ve done a few years ago in antarctica , which was clearly the best vacation i &apos;ve ever had , and i think relatively often in relation to how often i think of other vacation .
and i probably went from my memories to these three week , i would say about 25 minutes in the last four years .
now , if i had ever opened the folder with the 600 images in it , i had spent another hour .
well , these are three weeks , and these are just a one-hour hour .
there seems to be an inconsistent sense .
now , i like to be a little extreme , you know , how little appetite i have on the tob of memories , but even if you have more of it , there &apos;s a real question . why do we give memories so much weight in the weight of the weight that we give ?
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
imagine your next holiday , you know , at the end of the vacation , all of your images will be wiped out , and you get an amnestic drug , so you can &apos;t remember anything .
now , would you choose the same vacation ?
and if you &apos;re going to go to a holiday , there &apos;s a conflict between your two types of self and you have to think about how you &apos;re going to decide this conflict and that &apos;s really not obvious , because if you think in the sense of time , you could get a different answer .
why we choose the vacation that we choose is a problem that turns us into a choice between the two types of self .
now , the two types of self throw two terms of happiness .
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can use , one of ourselves .
so you can ask : how happy is the living self ?
and then you would ask , how happy are the eyes in the life themselves ?
and they &apos;re all -- happiness is a pretty complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
and , by the way , we &apos;re able to get a pretty good idea from happiness itself , by the way .
when you think about happiness , it &apos;s a very different thing .
it &apos;s not about how happy one person lives .
it &apos;s about how happy or delighted the person is when that person thinks about their lives .
very different term .
anyone who &apos;s not going to get these terms of terms , the study of happiness , and i &apos;m a lot of researchers on well-being , who have been covering the research of happiness for a long time .
the distinction between happiness itself and happiness has been recognized in the last few years , and now you &apos;re trying to measure the two separate .
the gallup organization has a global survey where more than half a million people have been asked about what they think about their lives and about their experiences , and there were other efforts in the direction .
so in the last few years , we started to learn about happiness of ourselves .
and the main lesson that we think i learned is that they &apos;re really different .
you can know how happy someone is with his life , and that really doesn &apos;t teach you how happy he lives , and vice versa .
just to give you a sense of the correlation , the correlation is about .5 .
what that means is that if you were to meet somebody and you would tell them , oh , his father is a two-meter man , how much would you know about his size ?
well , you would know something about his size , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
if i tell you that someone has a life as eight on a scale of 10 , they have a lot of uncertainty about how happy it is with his own selves .
so the correlation is low .
we know something about the happiness of happiness itself .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know that happiness basically means being satisfied with people we like to spend time with people we like .
there are other pleasure , but that &apos;s dominant .
so if you want to maximize the happiness of the two types of self at the end of the self , it &apos;s very different things .
the implication of what i said here is that we really shouldn &apos;t think of happiness as a substitute for well-being .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
well , very briefly , another reason we can &apos;t think about happiness is that we don &apos;t look at the same stuff when we think about life and when we actually live .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people are in california , they won &apos;t get the correct answer .
if you think about this question , people in california have to be happier when they say , in ohio .
and what &apos;s happening is that when you think about life in california , you think about the difference between california and other places , and that difference , we say , in climate .
well , it turns out that climate is not very important for the living self , and it &apos;s not even very important for itself , which decides how happy people are .
now , because it &apos;s responsible for yourself , you can at the end -- some people might end up going to california .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to pursue what happens to people who go to california in hope to be happier .
well , you &apos;re not going to be happier .
we know that .
but one thing is going to happen . you will think they &apos;re happier , because if you think about it , you &apos;ll remember how awful the weather was in ohio , and you &apos;ll feel that you &apos;ve made the right decision .
it &apos;s very difficult to think about well-being , and i hope i gave you a sense of how difficult it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question for you .
thank you .
now , when we were in front of a couple of weeks ago , they told me that there was a pretty interesting outcome that came from this gallup poll .
is that something you can tell us about , because now you &apos;ve got a few minutes left ?
daniel cairo : sure .
i think the most interesting result that we found in the gallup poll is a number that we didn &apos;t expect to find .
we found that in terms of happiness itself .
when we looked at how feelings interact with income .
and it turns out that under a income of 60,000 dollars a year , for americans , and that &apos;s a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a big representative sample , under income of 600,000 dollars a year .
60,000 .
dk : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars a year is people are unhappy , and they &apos;re increasingly unhappier , the worse they will be .
we get an absolutely flat line .
i mean , i rarely saw flat lines .
what happens is , obviously , that money doesn &apos;t make a experience happiness , but that lack of money is a lack of money , and we can measure this misery very , very clear .
in the sense of other self , the memory itself gets a different story .
the more money you deserve is you deserve .
it &apos;s not for emotion .
but danny , throughout america , is about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
if people would take this seriously , i mean , it seems to put everything on your head , everything we believe in terms of tax policy and so on .
is there a chance that politicians , that the country would generally take a fund like the serious , and do politics based on it ?
dk : you know , i think there are recognition for the role of happiness in politics .
the recognition is slowly going to be in the united states , not a question , but in the u.k. it &apos;s happening right now , and in other countries , it &apos;s just happening .
people are starting to realize that they should think about happiness when they think about politics .
it &apos;s going to take a while , and people will argue whether they want to study experiences happiness or whether they want to study life review , so we have to make this discussion pretty soon .
how to grow happiness is very different depending on how you think and whether you think about it yourself or whether you think of the living self .
that will affect politics , i think , in the years .
in the united states , they tend to measure the experience of the population happiness .
this is going to be , i think , in the next one or two decades of national statistics .
well , it seems to me that this topic is going to be , or at least to follow the most interesting political debate about the next few years .
thank you for the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you , danny kahneman .
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal . i dethrow video games .
i &apos;ve been developing online games for 10 years , and my goal for the next decade is to make it easy to save the world in reality , as you &apos;re playing in online games .
i have a plan for this . i want to convince more people , including them all , more time with play greater and wild games .
we currently spend three billion hours a week playing online .
some of you might think , &quot; that &apos;s a lot of time for games . &quot;
maybe something too much time when you think about how many problems we really have to solve in the real world .
but in fact , my research at the institute for the future is exactly the opposite .
three billion hours a week is not nearly enough to solve the most urgent problems in the world .
in fact , i believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to dramatically increase that time .
i &apos;ve calculated that the need of age at 21 billion hours of play is a week .
this may be something that seems to happen first , so i repeat it , so that if we want to solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change and obesity , i think we need to try to play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week to the end of the next decade .
no , i mean really seriously .
why ? this picture describes pretty much why i believe that games are so essential to the survival of the human species in the future . seriously .
this is a photographer of photographers phil toledano .
he wanted to capture the feelings of play . so he built a camera in front of the players .
this is one of the classic words playing .
if you &apos;re not a player , you may have some of the nuances in this picture .
you &apos;re probably seeing this sense of urgency , something fear , but also the first concentration of concentration , all of a profound problem .
as you play , you see some nuances here that are up to the top of the eyes and the mouth is a sign of optimism . the eyebrows show the surprise .
this is a player standing on the edge of what &apos;s called the epic settlement .
oh , you know that . ok . prima . so we have some players here .
a epic victory is a result that is so incredibly positive that they didn &apos;t know that it was possible at all .
it was about the imagination of imagination .
and if you reach it , you &apos;re shocked to actually be able to do that . that &apos;s a epic victory .
this player is short before a epic victory .
and this is what we have to see on a million faces of problem-solving in the world , if we take the barriers of the next century , the face of the next century .
well , unfortunately , we tend to see this face in real life when we face hard problems .
i call it a &quot; in life &quot; face , and it &apos;s actually my face , you know ? yes ? ok .
that &apos;s me , as i &apos;m in life , &quot; i do bad face .
this is a graffiti in my former home in berkeley , california , where i studied in my ph.d. , why we &apos;re in play better than in real life .
this is a problem that many players have .
we think we &apos;re not as good in reality as games .
and i don &apos;t mean just less successfully , although that &apos;s what it belongs to .
we get more in play worlds . i mean good in the context of motivation , something significant , inspired to collaboration with each other .
if we &apos;re in a game world , i think that a lot of us turn into our best version , at any time , are willing to be willing to solve the problem , to try and solve the problem as long as necessary .
and in reality , if we &apos;re failing , we feel often different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel defeated . we feel threatened , maybe depressed , frustrated or cynically .
these feelings have never , if we play games , they simply don &apos;t exist .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to explore as a graduate student .
why is it possible to play , to think , you couldn &apos;t just do anything ?
how can we transfer these feelings to the reality ?
so i looked at games like world of warcraft to solve the ideal environment .
and i &apos;ve noticed some things that make the epic odor in online worlds .
so , first of all , if you &apos;re going to get in one of these online games , especially at world of warcraft , there &apos;s a lot of different characters that are willing to trust you , and that immediately .
but not only any mission , but a mission that fits perfectly to your current level in the game , right ?
so they do that .
you never get a job that you can &apos;t solve .
but always on the edge of your capabilities , so you have to get yourself . but there &apos;s no unemployment in world of warcraft .
you don &apos;t sit around , and it turns out , and there &apos;s always something important to do .
and there &apos;s a way of staff .
where they &apos;re going , hundreds of thousands of people working with them to end their epic mission .
we don &apos;t have that easy in real life , this feeling that in a fingerbag of a finger , employees are ready to be ready .
also , there &apos;s this epic story , these inspiring history , why we are there and what we have to do .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
you &apos;ve heard of &quot; level high &quot; and &quot; + 1 &quot; or &quot; + 1 &quot; or a intelligence .
this constant feedback doesn &apos;t exist in real life .
if i leave this stage , i didn &apos;t speak : + 1 , and plus 1 crazy idea , plus 20 crazy idea .
i don &apos;t get that feedback in real life .
so , the problem of cooperative online worlds like world of warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying to stand at the edge of a epic dictator that we prefer to spend our whole time in this game worlds .
they &apos;re just better than reality .
until today , the world of warring players have spent 5.93 million years to solve the virtual problems of acorics .
that &apos;s not necessarily bad .
it may sound bad .
but to see it in context : 5.93 million years ago , our first primasters started to go upright .
so the first exciting math .
ok , so if we talk about how much time we spend in play with games , it just makes sense to the scale of the human development , which is extraordinary .
but also , it turns out , because it turns out that by using this whole time to play , it actually changes what we &apos;re able to do .
we &apos;re developing ourselves to collaborative , highly creatures .
that &apos;s the truth . i believe .
if you look at this interesting statistic that was published recently from a researcher of the carnegie mellon university , the average boy of today in a country with strong game culture spends 10,000 hours with online play to the 21st year .
so , 10,000 hours is a very interesting number , for two reasons .
first of all , for kids in the united states , 10.080 hours are the equivalent of all the time they spend in school , from the fifth grade to the degree of high school -- if you never miss .
so here we have a complete parallel education path on the young people as well learning what it means to be a good player , like everything else you learn in school .
and maybe some of you have the new book of malcolm gladwell , &quot; overfliver , &quot; read .
so you know his theory of success , the theory of the success of the 10,000 hours .
it &apos;s based on the great research of cognitive science that , if we spend 10,000 hours with the teddy study of a single subject to the 21st year , we &apos;re going to master .
we &apos;re going to be so good at what &apos;s the most important people in the world .
so what we have here is a whole generation of young people who are master-player .
so the big question is , &quot; what exactly are players good ? &quot;
because if we could figure that out , we &apos;d almost never have unprecedented human potential available .
so many people are now in the world who spend at least an hour of online play .
these are our master-players . 500 million people who are extraordinary in &quot; something . &quot;
and in the next decade we have another billion players that are extraordinary , whatever .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
the game industry is developing , saving energy and work on mobile nets , rather than the broadband internet , so players all over the world can play , especially in india , brazil online play online .
you expect an extra billion players in the next decade .
so we have 1.5 billion players overall .
so i started thinking , what is it about , what is it that these games are doing .
here are the four things that i found , first : the optimism optimism .
ok , imagine the extreme self-motivated .
urgent optimism is the desire to do something immediately to do a barrier , with the belief that we have a set of hope to success .
players always believe that a epic victory is possible , and it &apos;s always worth working , and it &apos;s the same .
players don &apos;t sit around .
players are masters in social networks .
there &apos;s a lot of more interesting trials that show people that we might like to do more after we played with them , even if they &apos;re hostile .
the reason is that it requires a lot of trust with someone playing a game .
we trust that somebody has time with us that the rules will be held , that we have the same goal , and to the end of the game .
so it enables you to play the growing of binary , trust and with each other .
as a result , we build stronger social relationships .
congratued productivity . fantastic !
you know , there &apos;s a reason why the average word of wardiance players are playing 22 hours a week , as a particle job .
the reason is , if we play , we actually are happier to work hard than when we relax or nothing .
we know that as human beings , we &apos;re going to succeed when we do hard , significant work .
and players are always willing to work hard when they get the right job .
and finally , epic meaning .
players love to become part of awe of awe policies .
here &apos;s a backpoint of india to go back to the right . you know all the wikipedia , the largest wiki of the world .
the second wiki of the world , with almost 80,000 nanometers , is the world of warcraft wiki .
five million people use it every month .
they &apos;ve combined more information about the world of warcraft in the internet than any other other wiki in the world .
they create a epic story .
they create a epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , so these are four superpowers that lead to a single outcome . players are super-powerful , hopeful individuals .
it &apos;s people who believe they can change the world .
and the only problem is that they believe they can change the virtual worlds , but not the real .
that &apos;s the problem i try to solve .
edward cakler ova is a national scientist .
his work is great . he studied why people spend so much time , energy and money in online worlds .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re not going to be a witness of less than a mass of mass in virtual worlds and online play environments . &quot;
and that &apos;s from an economist . so it makes sense .
and he says ...
not like me -- i develop games , i &apos;m a little bit more titified .
so he says that actually makes sense , because players can achieve more online worlds than in the real life .
you can play stronger social binsions than in real life , you get more feedback and rewards in play than in real life .
so he says it &apos;s completely logical right now that players have more time in virtual world than in the real world .
i first agree , that &apos;s logical .
but it &apos;s definitely not an optical situation .
we need to start changing the real world in a game .
my inspiration comes from an event that goes back 2,500 years .
there &apos;s these ancient cube out there , from sheep &apos;s pot . you know ?
in front of these fantastic games controllers , there were sheep cuts .
and these were sort of the first of people developed playing devices .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the works of the old greek historian herodotus , you may know this story . the story about how and why are games invented .
according to odototus , games have been created , more specific games , in the kingdom of a famine .
there was such a great famine that the king of lydies decided to have a crazy idea .
people suffered . people were fighting .
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
so , they invented , according to herodotus , the box game , and they had a national strategy . on a day you would eat . the next day you would play .
and they would go so much into the pory game , because games are so fascinating , and we &apos;re using satisfying , happy productivity that they would forget that there was nothing to eat .
and then the next day you would play . and the next day you would eat .
and according to odototus , they survived these famine for 18 years by eating in a day and playing the next .
so , i think , let &apos;s play a game .
we &apos;re doing games to escape the reality of the real world .
we &apos;re putting games in order to get rid of everything that doesn &apos;t work in the real world , and it &apos;s not satisfying in the real life , and we &apos;re taking ourselves out of play .
but it doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
that &apos;s the exciting thing .
according to tiodotus , the famine didn &apos;t get better for 18 years , so the king , a last tail , decided to put it .
they shared the kingdom in two camps .
they were playing a box game , and the seals were allowed to break into a epic adventure .
they left the lydies and they went to search for a new home . they just had so many people back , like the food , and they were looking for the rest of an area where they were thriving .
that sounds crazy , right ?
but recent data evidence shows that the etrus , who later developed the roman empire , the same dna as the old lyter .
so scientists recently came to the notion that herodotus is actually true .
and geologists found the evidence of a global hypothermia that took almost 20 years to explain what the famine could explain .
so this crazy story might be true .
you may have saved their people through play , using 18 years in games for 18 years , and then they &apos;ve had them , and so much over the course of each other , they learned that they have saved the whole civilization .
so , we can do that .
we &apos;ve been playing for 1994 .
this was the first strategy in real time in the world of warring series , which was 16 years ago .
they were playing for 18 years , we &apos;ve been playing warcraft for 16 years .
i say we &apos;re ready for our own epic game .
so , they sent half their civilization to search for a new world , so i take my 21 billion games a week .
we should say that half of us spend an hour per day with play , until we &apos;ve solved the problems of the real world .
i know you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; how do we solve the real world in play ? &quot; and that question , i &apos;ve dedicated my work to the future for the future .
we have this banner in our office in palo alto , it puts out how we should understand the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to tell the future before .
what we want is to create the future .
we want to think of the best possible outcome , and then people tend to get this idea into reality .
we imagine epic wins and give people the opportunity to reach them .
i &apos;m going to show you just three games that i &apos;ve designed to try and bring people to the epic odor in their own future .
this is &quot; the world without oil . &quot;
the game is from 2007 .
it &apos;s a online game where you have to overcome an oil shortage .
the oil scarcity is invented , but we have enough online content so that it will be realistic for you , and you actually live with no oil . so , if you look at the game , you tell us where you &apos;re going to design your real life , and you &apos;ve got to figure out how much oil is closed , and you have to figure out how much oil is closed , whether you &apos;re going to design your real life , you &apos;ve got to figure out how much oil is closed , whether you
we tested this game 1,700 players in 2007 , and we &apos;ve since passed them over the last three years .
and i can tell you it was a changing experience .
nobody wants to change his life because it &apos;s good for the environment or because we should .
but if you &apos;re in a epic adventure , and i said , &quot; we &apos;re going to get the oil out . &quot;
this is a fascinating adventure that you &apos;re going to do .
find out how they were going to survive . most of our players have been able to capture the habits in the game .
so for the next world record , we have a bigger , higher goal than just oil levels .
we &apos;ve developed the game &quot; superstruct ct &quot; at the institute for the future .
starting the computation of a supercomputer is that people have only 23 years on the planet .
this supercomputer is called the global dismortal system , of course .
the answer to players , we &apos;ve created almost like a &quot; jerry-bruster &quot; film .
you know jerry brutal &apos;s movies , where there &apos;s the &quot; wam-team . &quot; you have the astronauts , the scientists , the ex-laureates and just together , you can save the world .
but in our game , instead of just five people , let &apos;s say , everyone is in the boat team , and it &apos;s our job to create the future for energy , food , health , security and the future of social justice .
8,000 players played the game eight weeks .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that they can read , if they google &quot; superstruct ct . &quot;
and the last game we get on march three , it &apos;s a game in collaboration with the world bank .
if you finish the game , you get the award from the world bank , &quot; social retrogrowth , &quot; in 2010 .
we &apos;re working with universities in all the schwarzafrica , and invite them to learn social reconstruction .
we have a comic book . we have &quot; level high &quot; for regional understanding , knowledge , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .
i want to invite all of you to share this game with young people everywhere in the world , especially in developing environments that benefit from it , to save their own social enterprise to save the world .
i get to the end .
i want to ask you something .
what do you think happens next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t saved the real world .
well , i hope you agree that the players are human resources that we can use to work in the real life , and that games have a big meaning for change .
we have this whole superforce , congratued productivity , the ability to form close social nets , urgent optimism and desire for the epic meaning .
i really hope we play things together to survive on this planet another century .
and i hope you &apos;re going to design with me and play things like that .
now , when i look at the next decade , i &apos;m sure about two things : that we can create every single future , and we can play all kinds of games .
so i say , let &apos;s start the world changing games !
thank you .
i &apos;d like to share with you something about a few months ago at the time of a piece of excellence .
i used to write my synonym dictionary in the writing , but i was already ready to do the texture , and i realized that i had never been beaten in my life , what the word &quot; disabled &quot; meant .
i &apos;ll read to you the post .
&quot; disabled , &quot; adjegic : &quot; verling , helpless , useless , undestroyed , mutilated , mutilated , drowed , lahm , untapped , unforced , unpotent , paralyzed , unpotent , paralyzed , unpotent , paralyzed , unpotent , paralyzed , unpotent , paralyzed , uneffective , paralyzed , uneffective .
antonyme : healthy , strong , powerful power .
i read this list of a friend according to a friend , and i had to laugh , it seemed so ridiculous , but i only came to talk , and i didn &apos;t have to stop reading , and i had to stop reading , and first to go to see me , first of all .
of course , this was a balanced , old synonym dictionary . i just thought that the copy must be pretty old .
but in fact , it was an issue on the early &apos; 80s when i was just starting to primary school and started building my own image outside of my family , and to form in terms of other kids and the rest around me .
and thank god , i don &apos;t have a synonym dictionary at the time .
if i took this post seriously , i would be born into a world that someone like me would perceive as one person whose life could be positive in any way , but today i &apos;m going to be celebrated for the chances and adventure that i &apos;ve experienced .
so i immediately called the online copy of 2009 , and i would expect that i &apos;m here to take a grant .
here &apos;s the current version of this procedure .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
in particular , the last two words under &quot; near antonyms &quot; &quot; and &quot; healthy . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just the words .
it &apos;s about what we think about people we describe with these words .
it &apos;s about the values that are in these words , and how we engineer these values .
our language affects our thinking and how we see the world and the people around us .
many aging societies , including the greeks and the roman , really believed that the language of a flight has a huge force because that &apos;s what you &apos;re talking about .
so , what do we actually want to manifest -- a disabled person or a powerful human ?
just to give you an eight-child for eight as a child , it could be enough to prove it and get them oversent .
wouldn &apos;t it be beautiful to open the doors ?
a person who opened for me the doors was my pediatrician at the a.i. dupont institute in wilmington .
he &apos;s called dr. pianist , a italo-american , whose name , as you can think , most americans couldn &apos;t speak correctly . so he &apos;s always called dr. p. .
and dr. p. wore always very colorful flies , and it was just designed to work with kids .
i found the time that i spent in this hospital , just great -- to my physiological therapy .
i had to change some sort of practice that seemed to change infinitely with these thick , elastic b-- in different colors -- you know , to build my leg muscles , and i hated it . i hated them . i hated them . i hated them .
and imagine i even have a five-child with dr. p. vers and tried to stop this practice , natural without success .
and one day he looked at me at one of my practice -- these were just tiring and grace -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re such a strong , powerful and young girl , you &apos;re going to tear one day of one day .
and if you make it , i give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
that was , of course , just a simple trick of dr. p. , so i &apos;m doing the practice that i didn &apos;t want to do with the prospect that the richest five year-old girls in the hospital are in the next floor , but he actually got me to see my daily practice horror with new eyes .
and i wonder today , how much of his vision of me as a strong and powerful young girl made my self-image , and i could think of it as an nature of nature , powerful and breathing .
this is just an example of a lot of how adults can exploit the imagination of a child .
but as we already have quoted examples from the synonym dictionaries , our language doesn &apos;t allow us room to imagine what we would all wish : it &apos;s every single person to see themselves as powerful people .
our language depends on the social changes that have been caused by a technological change .
from the medical standpoint , of course , you can say that my legs , the laser surgery for visually disabilities , kbright joints from titan and artificial divers for aging bodies that allow people to actually define their own identity and apply them to groups that allow them to choose their natural destiny .
so maybe this technology change clear because ever there was always a other truth , which is that every person of the society has something special and very powerful , and that the human ability to adapt , our biggest plus is .
the human ability to adapt -- that &apos;s an interesting story , because people always ask me to tell you how i &apos;m going to talk to widriction and i &apos;m going to give you something : this sentence has never touched me , and i &apos;ve always felt very uncomfortable to answer the questions of people , and i &apos;ve always felt very uncomfortable with that .
this sentence of dedriction lives from the idea that success or happiness depends on trying to master a challenge without being able to be able to do with that experience as if my life was so successful because i could drop the potential of life with a prosthetic .
but the truth is that , of course , we are changing . of course we are influenced by the challenge , whether it &apos;s physically , emotionally or even both .
and i say that &apos;s good .
widricies are not a barrier that we have to turn around to make our lives better .
widricies are just to our lives .
and i tend to see widricies as my shadow .
sometimes i do that he &apos;s very present , sometimes he &apos;s hardly seeing , but he &apos;s always at me .
and i don &apos;t want the impact and the hard of the road of a human being .
there are widricies in life , and the challenges , and they &apos;re just true and every person &apos;s going to do it differently , but the question is not whether we &apos;re going to get rid of it or not , but how do we get to it ?
so we &apos;re not just responsible for keeping people that we love to preserve , but they also prepare to get good with it .
and we don &apos;t like our kids if we give them the feeling that they can &apos;t adapt .
you have to separate two things : for a medical fact , to be amputated , and the social opinion of whether i &apos;m disabled or not .
and to be honest , the only real and lead disability that i had to take away with is that the world is constantly meant to describe me with these definitions .
in our desire to protect people who are at the heart of us and tell them the cool , hard truth about their medical observation , or even a forecast to the quality of life that they expect , we have to look at that we don &apos;t actually have a bribe for that .
maybe this is a concept that just looks at what &apos;s in a broken , and how we repair that , for every single one more disability than the pathology .
if we don &apos;t treat a human , and not all its forces and possibilities , we create in addition to the natural struggle that you may have to lead to , another disease .
we &apos;re facing a human being worth a value for our society .
so we have to look at the patology and focus on all the area of human possibilities .
but most importantly , it &apos;s between the perception of our misconceptions and our great insights , a connection .
we shouldn &apos;t be able to discount or deny those challenges , we shouldn &apos;t try to avoid them , we should be able to avoid them , but it &apos;s about realizing the odds .
i may be more interested in making sure that we don &apos;t necessarily have to overcome , but that we &apos;re open to embrace them , to put it in , and maybe even use it .
and maybe we can see it , widricies as something natural , consistent and useful and useful , and we don &apos;t feel so biased by their presence anymore .
in this year , we celebrate the 200 : the birthday of charles darwin , and when he wrote about evolution 150 years ago , darwin , in my eyes , has suggested to something very true in the human character .
i would write it like this : not the most powerful of the way it survived , and also not the most intelligent of his kind , but the one that can adapt to changes best .
conflicts emerge from conflict .
not only from darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability to survive and to survive , from the fight of the human mind , is to turn through conflict .
so again , change and adaptation are the greatest skills of people .
and maybe we first know what wood we are , when we &apos;re really tested .
maybe the point of widricies , a perception of the itian , is a sense of our own power .
we can teach ourselves something like that .
we can make a new meaning that goes beyond severe times .
maybe we can see as a change .
widricies represent change that we haven &apos;t yet adapted to .
i think the biggest damage that we &apos;ve added ourselves is to believe that we should be normal .
let &apos;s face who is normal ?
there &apos;s no normal .
there &apos;s the usual . the typical one , but not the normal . and would you really want to know this poor , gray person if you really have ?
i don &apos;t think more .
it would be great when we think of this paradigm of normal versus a different one of the possibilities or the strength to even make it a little bit more dangerous , and so we could replace the forces of very many children , and we can invite the forces of very special and valuable skills to society .
sophia found out that we humans from the members of our society have always been a persuasive : to be useful and to contribute .
there are evidence that the neanderthals have before 60,000 years ago and people with severe physical injuries , and perhaps , because life experience in survival was valuable for society .
they didn &apos;t look at these people as broken and useless ; they were treated as something special and valuable .
a few years ago , i went to the city where i grew up in a food market in this red zone in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i was standing there in front of a net toaf .
it was summer , and i had baseball .
and i hear a guy behind me says , &quot; well , if that &apos;s not aimee mullins . &quot;
and i turn around and i see this older man . i had no idea who he is .
and i said , &quot; excuse me , sir , we know ? i can &apos;t remember you . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , you might hardly remember me .
when i first saw her , i brought it out of her mother &apos;s belly . &quot;
oh , so the one .
and of course , it &apos;s done click .
this was dr. kean , a man i knew only from narratives of my mother about this day because i , of course , came to late my birthday two weeks .
the doctor for prenatal diagnosed of my mother was in vacation , and my parents knew the man who brought me to the world at all .
and because i was born without legs , and my feet came to them , and i just got a few toes on this and a few toes on the other foot , and he had a few toes on the other foot .
he said to me , &quot; i had to tell your parents that you would never walk , and never want to be as moving as other kids or that you could never lead an independent life . &quot;
in fact , i found that he had collected newspaper cuts of my childhood childhood , whether i had won on a letter competition in the second grade , if i was on the parade of the parade in the parade of the parade , whether i had my scholarship or the hershey medical school .
and he called this part of his crank factor , the potential of the human will .
you can &apos;t just emphasize enough how critical this factor can be for a human being .
and dr. kean continued to tell , he said , &quot; i &apos;ve learned that kids , if they don &apos;t get something else , and even if they get a little bit of support , then children can achieve a lot . &quot;
see , dr. kean changed his thinking .
he understood that the medical diagnosis , and as someone with it , are two different things .
and i also changed my thinking over time when they asked me about 15 years old , if i would have supported my prostheses against legs and bones , then i would have no shortcut .
i wanted to be normal at the time .
if you ask me that today , i &apos;m not sure .
and that &apos;s because i &apos;ve experienced something with my legs and not even that experience .
and maybe this change could happen because i met so many people who opened the doors instead of watching people who are restricting me or i wanted to address an idea .
you see , it really takes a person who shows you how to manifest their forces , and they &apos;re through .
if you allow someone to activate your own inner forces , the human spirit is so eager -- if you can do it , and for somebody in a critical moment , you &apos;re a very good teacher .
they bring them to the doors of themselves .
the real meaning of the &quot; realist &quot; crossing the word &quot; eduardo . &quot;
it means something produced that in one is , the potential to tickle out .
again , what potential are we going to call ?
in the &apos; 60s , in the united states , in the u.k. , there was a case study in the united states .
they call this &quot; pass trials &quot; in the u.s. we call it &quot; tracking . &quot;
the students are distributed to notes .
and a student is tested harder , getting the better teachers and so on .
and then they gave over a three-month period of time with a &quot; enough &quot; period , &quot; very good &quot; the note , and it was said to you that they were very clever , and after those three months , they really signed up .
and of course , there &apos;s a heart of listening to the heart that , in reverse , they have been told in the opposite students , they &apos;re only enough .
and it was also about three months later .
but only those who were still in school -- except from the students who had the school .
very crucial to this study , the teachers were not locked .
the teachers didn &apos;t know something changed .
they just said that be the student student and that are the students with the grade , and they &apos;ve taught them something , and they &apos;re treating them .
the only real disability is a broken mind , which has been broken , has no hope anymore , and it doesn &apos;t find any more beauty ; it &apos;s missing our natural , childhood curious , and our innate ability of imagination .
but if we can do it , to support the human spirit , we continue to hope to find ourselves and other people around themselves , curious and deliberate , then we put our forces really positive .
if a mind has about these qualities , we can create a new reality and new forms of life .
i &apos;d like to end with a poem that was written by an persian poer called hafiz in 140s , and my friend jacques tells me , and the poem is called &quot; the god who knows only four words , not god &apos;s name , not the god who knows four words , not the god who knows four words , not the god who knows four words . &quot;
come on , dance with me . thank you .
how would you want better than you &apos;re right now ?
suppose i said , through a few changes of their genes , a better memory could have -- more precise and faster .
or you want to have wings , more force .
do you want more attractive and more confident ?
how would it be longer to live with good health ?
or maybe they &apos;re one of those who are always looking at more creativity .
what would you love most ?
which one would you like to have if you could only have one ?
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see .
a few . probably about as many as the creative people here .
that &apos;s very good .
how many would make a good memory ?
a few more .
what about fitness ?
some less .
what about longevity ?
ah , majority . i like to see this as a doctor .
if you could have one of them , it would be a very different world .
is this all education ?
or is it possible ?
evolution has been a ongoing issue here on the ted conference , but today i want to give you the view of a doctor &apos;s view .
the big genetic rule in the 20th century , mogs dobzhansky , who was also a communist in the russian orthodox church , wrote a confession called &quot; nothing in biology . &quot;
now , if you &apos;re one of those who don &apos;t accept the evidence of the biological evolution , this would be a very good moment , you take your listening device , you take your personal communication -- i give you permission -- and maybe you can take a look at kathryn school .
but if you accept biological evolution , what do you think is about the past , or is it going to be about the future ?
is it good for others or does it matter ?
this is another look at the tree of life .
in this picture , i &apos;ve put a bush as a center of the head in all directions , because if you look at the margins of the tree of life , all existing specialists have had success ; it has survived its environment ; it has its environment fitness ; it has its environment fitness .
the human part of this book , far at the end , is what we &apos;re most interested in .
we have two genes from a common ancestor to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago .
in this period , there might be 20 or 25 different species of hominids .
some are come and walked .
we &apos;ve been here for about 130,000 years .
it seems like we &apos;re right from the other parts of the building of life , but actually to the largest part , the basic mechanisms are our cells quite equal .
is it clear that we can use it , and the mechanisms of a common bacteria can adapt to produce the protein of the human insulin , which is used to treat diabetics ?
this is not like human insulin ; this is the same protein that is chemically unstructured from what &apos;s coming from the panse .
and by talking about bacteria , you know that every one of us in our gut leads more bacteria than it leads cells in the rest of our body ?
maybe 10 times as many .
i mean , do you think , if antonio damasio asks her self-image , do they think about the bacteria ?
our gut is a wonderful host environment for these bacteria .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s wet , it &apos;s very comfortable .
and you &apos;re all going to be all of the nutrients that you might want to provide without effort .
it &apos;s really an easier way to make bacteria , with the occasional subteritions of the unintended , jeodch .
but otherwise , they &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria , as they are important for their lives .
they &apos;re helping digestion from essential nutrients , and they protect them against certain diseases .
but what will happen in the future ?
are we in a form of evolutionary equilibrium in a form of species ?
or are we probably a little different -- something that may even be better for the environment ?
so let &apos;s take a step back into the era of the big bang 14 trillion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years ago -- the first signs of creatures , maybe three to four billion years ago -- the first signs of living organisms , perhaps three to four billion years ago -- and then the human species , which is after the last 130,000 years .
in this vast uncrowded symphony of the universe , life on earth is only very short measure ; the animal kingdom , like a single batt ; and the human life , a small piece of expression .
we were .
this is also the historical value of this talk , which is why i hope you guys like it .
now , when i was on college , i had my first biology classes .
i was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology .
i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i thought , something very fundamental : most of life of life in one-on-one organisms , each cell , and all the genetic information of the cell will move in both of the cells .
but at the time , as a majority organisms showed up , things began to change .
sexual reproduction emerge in the picture .
and most importantly , with the introduction of sexual reproduction , there &apos;s going to be the rest of the body .
in fact , in fact , you could say that the inevitable of the death of our body in the same moment is going to happen as the sexual reproduction .
now i &apos;ve got to stand when i was a college student , i thought , okay , sex / death , death / death , death for sex -- it seemed to be pretty reasonable at the time , but with every year , it has come to my mind .
i &apos;ve come to understand the feelings of george burns in las vegas , who led his show in the &apos; 90s .
and one night , there &apos;s a pat on his hotel room .
he opens the door .
in front of him , a beautiful sketch of entertainment .
she looks at him and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for super-sex . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s wonderful , &quot; george , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the soup . &quot;
i came to the realization as a doctor that i was a goal that was different than the goal of evolution -- not inevitable , just different .
i tried to preserve the body .
i wanted to keep ourselves healthy .
i wanted to rebuild health to a disease .
i wanted us to live a long and healthy life .
evolution is all about upcore of the genome to the next generation , adaptation and survival generation .
from an evolutionary standpoint , they are , and i &apos;ve developed like craster rockets to send the genetic ask into the next stage of the orbit , then to drop into the ocean .
i think we would all have the mood , the woody allen to understand when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to be unmortality through my work .
i want to do it by not dying . &quot;
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily mean to prefer the longest life .
it doesn &apos;t necessarily make the biggest , the most powerful or the fastest , and not even the smartest .
evolution pristengizes the creatures that adapt best to their environment .
it &apos;s just the test of survival and success .
on the bottom of the ocean , bacteria are there , which are thermophihil , and by the means of the hot defects , if fish were there , there would be a vacuum of fish in the line .
so , what does that mean when we look back at what &apos;s happening in evolution , and how we think about the place of people in evolution , and especially how we look at the next phase , i would say there &apos;s a series of options .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to move forward .
we &apos;ve reached a kind of equilibrium .
and the reason for this would be that , first of all , we were able to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been selected and removed from the population .
and secondly , as a species of species , our environment has been so configuring us that we &apos;ve managed to adapt to us as well as we adapt to them .
and by the way , we travel and we mix and mix so much that they don &apos;t need to say that isolation is necessary for the evolution , to find out .
a second possibility is that it will be evolution of traditional ways , of course , on the forces of nature .
and the argument , here , would be the wheels of evolution slowly , but they are unpleasant .
and so far as the isolation goes as a species as a species , it will be isolated and the changes of the environment that can produce evolution in natural ways .
but there &apos;s a third possibility , a tempting , fascinating and scary possibility .
i call it the neo-evolution -- the new development that isn &apos;t just natural , but followed by us as an individual in the decisions that we do .
now , how did this happen ?
how could it be possible that we do this ?
let &apos;s first look at the reality that people today are making decisions about their offspring .
they are , in some cultures , the choice to have more men than women .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and family choose .
so think if it wasn &apos;t just possible to choose the gender of your child , but also to make genetic adaptations that are healing and to prevent .
what if you could make the genetic changes to get diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s disease or reduce the risk of cancer or stroke ?
wouldn &apos;t you want it to make these changes in your genes ?
if we predict , these kinds of changes will be increasingly possible .
the human genome project started in 1990 , and it took 13 years .
it cost 2.7 billion dollars .
next year , when it was done in 2004 , they could do the same thing for 20 million dollars in dran to four months .
today , you can have a sequence of three billion bases of human genome to a price of about $ 20,000 and in the space of about a week .
it &apos;s not going to take longer until the reality will be that there will be 1,000 human genomes , and it &apos;s increasingly available for everybody .
a week ago , the national academy of engineering was the draper prize for francis arnold and wilfustemmer , two scientists who developed independently from each other &apos;s techniques that encourage the natural process to work faster and wanting to be more effective in a more efficient way .
a couple of years ago , the laser prize was borrowed the scientist in shinya yamanaka for his research in which he took a grownaal adult , a fibrosts , and by the manipulation of just four genes , the cell organized to go back to a pluripotent stem cell -- a cell potentially .
these changes are happening .
the same technology that can make the human insulin in bacteria , viruses that don &apos;t just protect themselves , but also to be immune to other viruses .
whether you believe it or not , it &apos;s an experimental study in the gang with the vaccine in the cells of a tobacco plant .
can you imagine something good that comes from tobacco ?
this is all reality today , and the future is going to be much more possible .
then just imagine two other little changes .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change your cells ?
what if you could change the sperm and protein cells or the fresh water to give your children a better chance for a healthier life -- eliminating diabetes , eliminating the risk of cancer ?
who doesn &apos;t want to be a healthier child ?
and then the analytic technology , the same engine of science that can allow the changes to prevent disease to prevent disease , could allow us to adopt super-benefits , hyper-capacity -- the better memory .
why don &apos;t we have the proability of a king jennings hben , especially if you can expand it with the next generation of the horse machine ?
why not have the fast muscle fibers that allow them to run faster and longer ?
why not live longer ?
these are going to be unconsistent .
and if we &apos;re in a position where we can pass it into the next generation , and we can adopt the attributes that we want , we will be transformed by alt. style evolution .
we &apos;re going to have a process that might require 100,000 years , and we can put it on a thousand years -- and maybe even on the next 100 years .
these are decisions with which their grandchildren have to be , or their grandchildren are going to have to deal with .
we use these decisions to form a society that is better , which is more successful ?
or are we going to selectively choose different attributes that we want for some of us and not for others ?
are we going to form a society for a society , and is it more robust , or robust and more powerful ?
these are the kinds of questions we &apos;re going to have to face .
and most of all , are we ever going to be able to develop the wisdom and the wisdom that we need to make these decisions ?
in the good way , and as you might think , these decisions are going to be to us .
thank you .
now , i want you to imagine something , a portable robot that gives you human skills , or another person who helps to stand up and go back and go .
in berkeley bionics , these robots call exotic skeletons .
they &apos;re not other than something they put in the morning and gives them extra strength and increase the speed of their velocity and will help them keep their balance .
this is actually the real idea of human and machine .
but not only that -- so that connects them and connecting them to the universe and other devices out there .
that &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
now to show you what we &apos;re working on , we start talking about the american soldiers in the average of about 100 pounds on its back , and it &apos;s the question that you should carry more equipment .
of course , this leads to some major complications -- spinal injuries , 30 percent of them -- chronic spinal injury .
so we thought we would take this challenge and create a exotic skeleton that would help deal with this problem .
so let me introduce you now -- or the human universal imperative .
soldier : with the hulc exotic skeleton , i can carry 200 pounds of all sorts of things like this .
its flexible design allows you to swallow down deep , to get to warriors and do highly agile movements .
it feels what i want to do , where i want to go and then increase my strength and take off .
we &apos;re also , with our industrial partners , this device , this new exotic skeleton in this year .
so it &apos;s true .
now let &apos;s take a look at the curol drivers , something that i &apos;m particularly passionate about .
there are 68 million people in the world who are in the wheelchair .
that &apos;s about one percent of the population .
and that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate .
we &apos;re often talking about very young people with spinal cord injuries that are in the streets of their life -- 2020s , 13 -- from the destiny , and the wheelchair is the only option .
but it &apos;s also about the aging population whose number of people multiplied .
and so pretty much the only option -- if it comes to a brain beat , or other complications -- is the wheelchair .
and so it &apos;s been for 500 years since , by the way , how i have to say , very successful introduction .
so we thought we could start writing a completely new chapter in the field of mobility .
so let me introduce you now , which is worn by amanda boxes , who had a spinal cord injury , which had a spinal cord injury for the result that they couldn &apos;t walk over 19 years .
thank you .
as i said , amanda carries our shock .
it has sensors .
his fully non-invasive sensors in the krtches , the signals send back to our onboard computer , which is attached to her back .
this is also battery pack , the motor propulsion is on their hives , as well as their knees that move forward in this rather smooth and very natural way .
i was 24 years old , and i was in the best form , as a montary tree tree during a ski tree .
in a fraction of a second , i lost every feeling and every movement underneath my submersible .
not long afterwards , a doctor in my hospital and he said , &quot; amanda , you &apos;ll never go back . &quot;
and that was 19 years ago .
it &apos;s steel every five of hope from my consciousness .
adaptable technologies have been able to learn to go to learning again , climb , climb and even drive the hands .
but nothing was invented that would let me go back to now .
thank you .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to meet us and discuss with them .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we have the whole potential to change the life of future generations -- not just for the soldiers , or for amanda here and all the curol drivers , but for everybody .
thank you .
at home in new york , i &apos;m boss of development station called robin hood .
if i don &apos;t pay poverty , i fought as a firemaster of a firemaster in a volunteer , the fire .
well , in our city , in the volunteers of a highly skilled professional fire service , you have to be pretty early on the wage to be able to mix .
i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunteer at the brandure , so i had a pretty good chance to be able to do it .
but it was still a failure against the other volunteers to reach the authorities and figure out what our tasks would be .
when i found the main man , he had just been in a very serious conversation with the dancer who certainly had one of the worst days of her life .
it was in the middle of the night , and she was in the sleeping train , and he was under a screen out in the retail rain , while her house was in flames .
the other volunteers that arrived close to me -- let &apos;s call him lex luther -- got the main man first and was asked to go into the house and save the dog &apos;s dog .
the dog ! i was talking about heart muscle .
there was some lawyer or a non-profit , which now for the rest of his life could tell people that he went into a burning of the house to save a living creature , just because he was five seconds faster than me .
well , i was the next .
the main man winded me .
he said , &quot; well , you have to go to the house .
they have to go up , to the fire , and have to get a pair of shoes . &quot;
i swear .
well , not exactly what i was hoping , but i went -- the stairs up , the flur , the flur , the &quot; the real &quot; firemen , the &quot; the real &quot; firemen that was so pretty finished at this point .
i know what you &apos;re thinking , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i had my prey back down , where i met my enemy on the front door and met my loved dog .
we put our values out to the dancer , where , not surprisingly , his much more attention than i did .
a couple of weeks later , the fire department got a letter of the janitors in which they were eating for the taping using their house .
now , one of the things that affected all of kindness : someone had a pair of shoes .
in my profession at robin hood as well , in my side career as a volunteer fireman , i &apos;m witness of generosity and kindness in the great scale , but i also see the expertise and the muts of individuals .
and do you know what i learned ?
they &apos;re all important .
so if i look around this room and see people who have either succeeded , or in their way there , i want to offer that memory : don &apos;t wait .
don &apos;t wait to make a difference in a different life , until you &apos;ve reached your first million .
if you have something to give , you give it now .
they &apos;re in a organ kitchen kitchen , they put a park in the neighborhood .
be a mentor .
not every day will give us an opportunity to save a human life , but every day offers us to change one .
so they go ; save the shoes .
thank you .
bruno guissani : mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
i just come back from a community that knows the secret of humanity &apos;s life .
a place where women will lead the zepter , &quot; hello , &quot; and the game determines the day -- where fun is a serious issue .
and no , it &apos;s not multi-touch or san francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , their relatives .
this is the world of the wild bonobos in the ancient forest of congo .
bonobos are together with chimpanzees our next living relatives .
that means we have a shared ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother , which lived about six million years ago .
now , chimpanzees are known for their aggressive .
but unfortunately , we &apos;ve overstated this aspect of the human evolution .
but bonobos show us the other side of the medal .
as chimpanzees get led by large , fear warning , the feminine society of empowerment is given female .
they really came up with what came up , because that leads to a super-tolerance society , where the deadly violence has not been observed .
but unfortunately , bonobos at least are familiar among primates .
they live in the deep of the congolese archetwhale , and they &apos;re very hard to do .
congo is a paradox -- a country extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of the darkness itself -- the scene of a violent argument that has been held for decades and so on .
it doesn &apos;t surprise that these destruction are also the survival of bonobos .
meat trade and the decline of the tree is that you could not even fill a stadium with the communicates -- and even there we are , to be honest .
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a hidden laugh that the trees burst .
who are these relatives ?
we &apos;re familiar with the &quot; love instead of war &quot; monkey , because they have common , also more bisexal sex , with interacting partners , and rules such as conflict .
i &apos;m not saying that &apos;s the answer to all the humanitarian problems -- because life is made of more than the cama sutra .
bonobos -- like people -- love to play their lives long .
play is not just child games .
for us , it &apos;s fundamental to the attachment of relationships and care of tolerance .
we learn trust and the rules of the game .
play creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s all about the creation of diversity -- diversity of interactions -- diversity of interactions , diversity of behaviors , diversity of connections .
and when you observe bonobos in the game , you see the evolutionary origins of human salmon , dance and rituals .
play is the tickt that sticks with us .
now , i don &apos;t know how they play , but i want to show you some unique footage from the wild .
first of all , a balloon game on feminine art -- and i don &apos;t think of football .
so here &apos;s a young female and males in a tracking game .
look at what she does .
it could be the evolutionary origin of : &quot; you put it in the eggs . &quot;
just that i think it &apos;s like it , not true .
yeah !
so sex games are common , both with bonobos and humans .
and this video is really interesting , because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows the ideality that you have to bring new elements into the game -- like the testes -- and also , as a game makes both trust as well .
but the game is a shape-designed .
play is a shape-designed , and it can adopt lots of forms , some of which some of them are quiet , deliberate , curious -- maybe to discover the wondrous again .
and i want to show you that this is fusion , a young female , and it plays peace with water .
i think it &apos;s just like playing alone , and we &apos;re in lots of our inner and outer worlds .
and it &apos;s these playful curiosity that makes us research , and interact , and the unexpected wiring that we form are the real stem soil of creativity .
this is just a little taste on the insights that bonobos give us in our past and present .
but it &apos;s also a secret for our future , a future in which we need to adapt to the challenges , through greater creativity and prints .
the secret is that the game is the key to these skills .
in other words , play is our adayokers .
in order to succeed , we need to play .
but are we going to make the best of our play ?
play is not silly .
it &apos;s essential .
for bonobos and people equally , life is not from teeth and claws alone .
now , if it &apos;s hardly appropriate , maybe the most appropriate thing seems to be .
and so , my favorite teammates , let &apos;s embrace this gift of evolution , and play together , while we can discover creativity the camera and wonder .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two pairs , middle 1979 , at the same day , in exactly the same moment , every bill a baby -- okay .
so two pairs , each bill a baby .
now , i don &apos;t want you to spend too much time the progress , because if you think of the whole time , you will not listen to me .
just imagine that for a moment .
and in this scenario , imagine that in a case the sperm chomouna carries on the x chromosome of the ice cell .
and in the other case , the sperm is a x chromosome hitting the x chromosome of the ice cell .
both of them are viable , both fires .
we &apos;ll come back to these people later .
in most of my activities , i &apos;ve got two coins .
under a hat , i &apos;m involved in the history of anatomy .
i &apos;m a lesson , and in this case , i study how people deal with anatomy -- that human body , animal bodies -- how they went with body fluids , with body fluids .
the other hat i carried in my work is the activist when patients -- or , i sometimes say , as an impatient lawyers -- from people who are patients from physicians .
in this case , i worked with people who have the body guys who ask social norms in question .
so for example , i worked with people who are siamese twins , two people in a body .
i grew up working with people -- so people who were smaller as usual .
and very often , i &apos;ve been working with intersexual people whose gender is -- so people who don &apos;t have the average male or female types .
and as general term , we can use the word of intersexual behavior .
intersexual behavior comes in many different forms .
i &apos;ll just give you a couple of examples of the types of people who don &apos;t include the male or female standard .
in a case , you may have someone with a representative chromosome base , and the sry gene of the y chomosoms leaves the slope of the y we &apos;ve all got to grow , grow .
and that &apos;s why the testicles are giving testosterone to testosterone .
but because this individual is missing the receptors to recognize testosterone , the body doesn &apos;t respond to testosterone .
and that &apos;s called androgenoric defect .
so much testosterone , but no reaction to it .
as a result , the body evolves more the typical female course .
if the kid is born , she looks like a girl .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s raised as girls .
but it often takes you to get puberty and grow your breasts and grow up , but you don &apos;t get your period until you get something different here .
and you make a couple of tests and you find that instead of iron sticks and utery , it &apos;s actually testicin and that you have a y chromosome .
it &apos;s important to understand that you might be able to hold this person for the cause of men , but they &apos;re not really .
women , like men , have something called adrenalinglsen .
they &apos;re in the back of our body .
and the side kidses are androgenic , which are virilitives hormones .
most women , like me -- i think a typical woman -- i don &apos;t know my real chromosome , but i think i probably have the typical -- most women like me actually talk to androgenic .
we produce androgen and we &apos;re talking to androgenic .
the consequence is that someone like me actually has a brain that has been exposed to more androgenic than a woman who was born with testicers , and an androgenal receptor defect .
so gender is really complicated ; interesting are not just in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in a sense , you can spread across the entire range .
another example : a few years ago , i received the call of a 19 year-old man who was born as a boy , as a boy , and he had a friend , he had a friend , had sex with his girlfriend , lived as a man , and he had just figured out he had an iron and a utera .
he had an extreme form of an innate side of the kidney cattle .
he &apos;s got xx chromosome , and in utero , his side kidney was so highly active that they created a male hormone environment .
and as a consequence , his genine men were covered , his brain was exposed to the establishment male part of the hormone spectrum .
and when he was born , he looked like a boy -- no one knew something .
and only when he was 19 years old , he got enough medical problems , in fact , because he was in the interior that doctors found that he was inside female .
okay , just a quick example of an alternative sexual behavior .
some people with xx chromosomes , they develop something called the oopy tissue , which is surrounded by hodenine tissue .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this is happening .
so gender can occur in many different varieties .
the reason why kids with this kind of body -- it &apos;s grown zwarf , or siamese twins , is often customized from surgeons to the norm , not because this is for their physical health benefits .
in many cases , these people are totally healthy .
the reason why it &apos;s often made different kinds of surgical engagement is because they count our social categories .
and typically our system is based on the idea that a certain anatomical oyctation goes to a specific identity .
so we have the concept that a woman is going to have a female identity ; a black person is meant to have an african anatomy in terms of their own history .
so we have this terrible idea .
and if we &apos;re faced with a body that is actually something very different for us , it &apos;s confused us in terms of these categories .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas about individualism .
and our nation is really based on a very romantic concept of individualism .
now you can imagine how amazing it is when kids are born , the two people in a body .
where i experienced most of the most excited , the south american dster was last year , whose gender in the leichattusics was asked in berlin in berlin .
many journalists call me the question , &quot; what are you going to do , who tells us whether caster semenya female or male is ? &quot;
and i had to explain the journalist that it didn &apos;t exist .
we now know that gender is complicated enough that we have to admit that nature is not a line for us between male and female and female and female and feminine and feminine and consexually and feminine and consexually . we &apos;re making touch that line of course .
so we have such a situation where , the further our science progresses , we have to be in order to make sure that these categories that we &apos;ve had for stable anatomical categories , which have been very simple to create permanent entrepreneurial talent , is a lot of inadversive things to do .
and that &apos;s not just about gender .
it &apos;s also true of what &apos;s a lot more complicated than our terminology has allowed .
we are in all sorts of uncurous areas .
for example , we &apos;re focusing on the fact that we have at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees .
what should we do with the fact that we &apos;re just different from a few nuclear brides ?
while we continue to move our science forward , we get increasingly in a zone of the ungene where we have to recognize that the simplifying categories that we &apos;ve had are probably too simple .
we see this in all kinds of human life .
one of the areas that we see this in our own culture today , in the united states today , are the struggle over the beginning and the end of life .
we have difficult conversations about what a body is going to do to people , so that it has another right than the fetal life .
we have very difficult conversations today -- maybe not as public as in medicine -- over the question when someone is dead .
our ancestors had never had that hard to fight when someone was dead .
they were given a quunder to the nose , and when they moved , they haven &apos;t been buried .
if you don &apos;t move , you have buried it .
but today we are in a situation where we &apos;re going to take people &apos;s vital organs , and they want to reproduce other people .
and as a result , we start with the really difficult question , when someone is dead , and that brings us into a really difficult situation that we don &apos;t have as simple categories as we used to .
now you might think that the whole thing is breaking together from categories of somebody like me , really happy .
i &apos;m politically progressive , i defending people with unusual bodies , but i have to admit , it makes me nervous .
to understand that these categories really are a lot more insecure than we thought i was doing .
and it drives me in terms of thinking about democracy .
so to tell you about this tension , i first have to know that i &apos;m a big fan of the founding fathers .
i know they were ragging , i know they were more sexiist , but they were great .
i think they were so tawn and they were very strong , and so radical , in which what they were doing is looking at all the years that i would look at all the years , and it &apos;s not because of the music that &apos;s absolutely forgotten .
it &apos;s because of what &apos;s happening in 1776 with the green fathers .
the green fathers were out of my view of the original anatomical activists , which is why .
and what she debates was an anatomical concept , and they put it through another , which was radical and beautiful , and 200 years for us .
as you all remember , our founding fathers took off the concept of monarchy , and the monarchy actually took on a very simplistic concept of anatomy .
the glory of the old world had no concept based on dna , but they had a concept of birth on the right .
they had a concept of blue blood .
they were the notion that people who had political power , these political power should have , because of the distribution of blood line from the grandfather to the father , and so on .
the green fathers criticized this idea and put them through a new anatomical concept , and this concept said that all people were creating equal .
they took the field field , and they decided that anatomically , the commonalities , were not the differences , and that was very radical .
now , they made this part because they were part of an educational system , where two things had grown together .
democracy grew , but at the same time , science grew .
if you look at the story of the founding fathers , that many of you are very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of natural world .
they went away from explanations from explanations , and debates things like a supernatural concept of power , back where the transmission on a very vadious concept of birth is based .
they moved to a natural situation .
and if you look at the independent cause of independence , you talk about nature and god of nature .
they &apos;re not talking about god and nature .
they talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
and as part of that , they made us a concept of anatomical similarities .
and with that , they have a really wonderful way of the future citizenship movement .
they didn &apos;t think about it , but what they did for us was great .
so what happened after that ?
for example , women who reacted the election right , the concept of the founding fathers , that says that anatomical collective is more important than the anatomical difference , and said , &quot; that we have a utera and we said , &quot; that we have to have a utera and we said , &quot; that we should have a utera and we should have the difference right . &quot;
and women were making it successful .
next was the successful civil rights movement , where we looked at people like somatoner , who was about , &quot; am i not a woman ? &quot;
we find men in the camps movement movement , which says , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , people in different colors that are affected on anatomical similarities differences , again , successful .
we see the same thing in disabled movement .
of course , the problem is that , as well as we start looking at all the commonalities , we have to start asking why we maintain certain spots .
well , comfortable , i want to sustain certain demonstrations , anatomically , in our culture .
for example , i don &apos;t want to give you the same rights as a person .
i don &apos;t want to say that we should take away from the anatomy .
i don &apos;t want to say that 5-year-old should have the right to give you to sex or to get married .
so there are some anatomical dives that make sense to me , and that we think i should keep .
but the challenge is to try and figure out what it is and why we keep them , and whether they &apos;re meaningful .
so let &apos;s go back to these two creatures that have been addressed to the beginning of the talk .
we have two creatures , both in the middle of 1979 , at exactly the same day .
let &apos;s imagine that one of them was born , maria , three months old , so she was born at june 1 1980 .
heinrich , on the other side , is born to the dawn of march , so he &apos;s born on march of march .
only because of the fact that maria has been born three months ago , they get all kinds of rights to have three months before heinrich -- to have the right sex , to choose the right to drink .
heinrich has to wait for all this , not because he actually has a different biological age , just because of the time point of his birth .
we &apos;ll find other strange ways of what their rights are .
heinrich , because you think it &apos;s male -- although i don &apos;t tell you that he is the mit with ddt -- because you think it &apos;s male , he can now be drawn to what maria doesn &apos;t have to worry about .
maria , in all states , can &apos;t perceive the same right , the heinrich in all states , and that is the right to marry .
heinrich can marry a woman , but maria can now only marry a woman in a few states .
so we have these permanent anatomical categories that are problematic in many ways and fragmented .
and for me , the question is : what are we going to do , because our science is doing these advances in the field of anatomy , that we have to get a point where we have to admit that a democracy that is based on anatomy , could separate ?
i don &apos;t want to give up science , but at the same time , sometimes it feels like science is doing self-warming .
so where do we go ?
it seems like our culture seems to be a kind of pragmatic posture : &quot; well , we need to move somewhere , so we pull them somewhere . &quot;
but a lot of people start in a very strange position .
so for example , texas has decided to get to a point that it means to marry a man , that you don &apos;t have y chromosome , and you get married to marry a y chromosome .
now in practice , people are not tested in their chromosome .
but it &apos;s also very bizarre because of the history that i told you about the nollywood receptor defect .
if we look at the founding fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us in his &quot; i have a dream . &quot;
he says we should not be people &apos; color , but after the quality of their character , &quot; judge , &quot; and goes beyond anatomy .
and i want to say , &quot; yes , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
but how do you do that in practice ?
how do you convey people because of their personality properties ?
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we &apos;re going to distribute rights to people , because i have to admit that i know a series of glaciers that are probably more likely than some people i know .
i want to say that i probably know some bright lab dogs that are more powerful , more intelligent and more mature decisions about their sexual relationships than others i know .
so how should we ask the question of the character of the character ?
it turns out to be really difficult .
and part of me asks , what if the content of a personality would be something that would be in the future , could be seen by an fmri ?
do we really want to go ?
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
what i know is that it really seems really important to think about the idea that the united states is leading to making thoughts about questions of democracy .
in our commitment to democracy , we did really well , and i think we would make our thing good in the future .
we don &apos;t have the situation , for example , in iran , where a man who feels sexually in other men is being punded with death , because he &apos;s ready to take an employee in an empty environment , which is the case he can stay alive .
the conditions of this kind exist in us .
i &apos;m glad to say that we don &apos;t have these states -- a surgeon i talked about a few years ago , who had a few siamese twins who had taken them to make a name .
but when i got to the telephone , and asked him why he made this input -- it was high surgeries -- his answer was that in his country , these kids would be treated very bad , and therefore he had to do it .
and i said , &quot; well , you &apos;ve got political asylals , instead of a surgery to separate it ? &quot;
the united states is offering incredible opportunities to allow people to be the ones that they are without changing the state of the state .
so i think we need to be leaders .
well , just to conclude , i want to realize that i &apos;ve talked a lot about the fathers .
and i want to think about the ways of thinking about how democracy could look , or looked at it , if we could have the mothers involved more .
and i want to say something is a little bit radical for a feminist , and i think that there might be different kinds of insight that are known by different kinds of anatomy , especially when people apply a group of money .
since years , since i was interested in interest , i was also interested in research in the field of gender .
and one of the things that i really found interesting is the difference between men and women in terms of how they think and operate in the world .
what we &apos;ve learned from cultural studies is that women , in average -- not every one , but in average -- tend to be more complex social relationships and the caring for people who are vulnerable within the group .
and so , when we think about it , we have an interesting situation .
years ago , when i went to graduate school , one of my college students who knew my interest in feminism -- i looked at myself as a feminist , doing it -- a really strange question .
he said , &quot; tell me what &apos;s a feminine female . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s the most stupid question i &apos;ve ever heard .
in feminism , it &apos;s kind of stereotypes to solve gender , which is why feminism is not a female .
but the more i thought about his question , so i thought it could be a female thing in feminism .
this is to say , &quot; there could be something in the average , what female brains are different from male brains , &quot; which makes us care more about highly complex social relationships , and attention to it for the protection .
so where the founding fathers were extremely definition to figure out how individuals could be protected before the state , it &apos;s possible that if we put more mothers in this concept , we &apos;re going to have a concept , not just how to protect , but how we can care for each other .
and maybe it &apos;s where we need to go in the future when we get democracy out of anatomy -- less than thinking about the individual bodies in terms of identity , and to think more about relationships .
so , when we try to create a people trying to make perfect connection , we think about what we can do for each other .
thank you .
i &apos;m jessi and this is my suitcase .
but before i show you what i have , i &apos;m going to make a very public confession , and that is : i &apos;m obsessed with outfits .
i love to find an opportunity to find a different kind of paint , crazy outfit , to read and photograph in the last time , and look at blogging .
but i buy nothing new .
i get all my clothes out of the second hand for the second hand , and in exchange .
ooh , thank you .
utilive shopping allows me to reduce the impact of my garderobe on the environment and also on my own exchange .
i meet all kinds of great people ; my dollars are usually serving a good purpose ; i look pretty unique ; and it &apos;s shopping to my hands .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
will it be my size ?
am i going to like the color ?
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
if all the answers , i feel like i &apos;ve won .
i come back to my suitcase , and i &apos;ll tell you what i came up with for this exciting week here at ted .
i mean , what does someone do with so many outfits ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought .
i brought seven pair of subpants , and it &apos;s all .
for a week , all i &apos;ve done in my suitcase is everything i &apos;ve done in my suitcase .
i drove all the other things i wanted to wear if i first got to palm springs .
and since she &apos;s not heard of me as the woman who runs around at ted in her underwear -- that is , i found some things .
and i want to show you my outfits for this week .
does that sound good ?
as i do that , i &apos;m going to give you some of the lessons that i am , whether you believe it or not , from this adventure , nothing new .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
i call this the bright tiger .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look great .
you can almost always look great for less than 50 dollars .
this whole outfit , including the jacket cost me 55 , and it was the most expensive piece that i carried in this whole week .
monday : color is more powerful .
it &apos;s almost impossible to be unable to be hostile , if you wear bright red pants .
if you &apos;re happy , you pull other happy people .
tuesday : remediated .
i spent a lot of time trying to try to be myself , and at the same time .
just be who you are .
if you &apos;re surrounded with the right people , you won &apos;t just understand it , you &apos;ll appreciate it .
wednesday : embrace your inner child .
sometimes people say to me , i looked like i was walking , and that i remember her seven year-old .
i like to smile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
thursday : self-confidence is the key .
if you think you &apos;re going to look good , it &apos;s almost safe .
and if you think you &apos;re not looking good in something , you &apos;re probably right .
i grew up with a mother who taught me that day for day .
but only when i got 30 , i really understood what that means .
and i &apos;m going to wrap that up for you .
if you think you &apos;re inside and outside a wonderful person , there &apos;s nothing you can &apos;t wear .
so there &apos;s no excuse for somebody here in this audience .
we should be able to swallow everything we want .
thank you .
in friday , a universal truth -- five words : gold paillete fits everything .
and finally , saturday : a own , unique , personal style is a great way to tell the world something about a , without having to say a word .
it was always proven to prove me and over again when people came to me in this week , just because of what i was wearing , and i had great talks .
obviously , it &apos;s not going to fit all my tiny suitcase .
so before i go home to brooklyn , i &apos;m going to donate it all back .
because the lesson i &apos;m trying to learn this week is that it &apos;s okay to let go .
i don &apos;t have to emotional these things , because in the same way , it &apos;s going to always be a different kind of crazy , colorfroous , high-radiation , just waiting for me if i love a little bit in the heart and find it .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good afternoon , all together .
i &apos;ve got something that i want to show you .
think of this as a picture , as flying imaging .
this is what we call our lab , perceptual design .
let me tell you a little bit about it .
now , if you take this picture -- i &apos;m in italian , and everybody in italy grows with this picture in his room , but the reason i show you this is something very interesting in the last decades .
a couple of times ago , if you wanted to win a formula , they took their budget and put their money on a good driver and a good car .
and if the car and the driver were good enough , they won the race .
now , if you want to win a race , you &apos;re actually going to need something like this -- something that &apos;s true in real time , some thousand sensors , a few thousand sensors , the information from the car , and then reprocess it and use things to make decisions back in real time while information .
this would call you , in engineering teams , a real-time control system .
and basically , it &apos;s a system that is made out of two parts -- a sense of a sense and reacting to a reaction .
what &apos;s interesting today is the real-time control systems begin to dive into our lives .
our cities were being equipped in the last few years , with networks and electronics .
they become computers in the free .
and as a computer in the free , you start reacting to other ways , you &apos;re going to be seen and driven .
if we put cities , it &apos;s actually a big deal .
by the way , i want to say that cities are only two percent of the earth &apos;s land , but 50 percent of the world &apos;s population live there .
they &apos;re 75 percent of the energy consumption -- to 80 percent of co2 emissions .
so if we do something with the cities , it &apos;s a big thing .
beyond the cities , all of this insight and driving into objects of everyday life .
this is from an exhibition , the paola antonelli for moma later , during the summer , organized .
it &apos;s called &quot; shut me with me . &quot;
now all of our objects , our environment , begin to speak back to us .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost like every atom is going out there , a sensor and a driver .
and it radically changes the interaction that we have people out of our environment .
in a way , it &apos;s almost like the old dream of michelangelo ...
you know , as a michelangelo shaped moses , it says that he took the hammer and threw it on moses -- actually , you can still see a little bit of untendrous -- and said , &quot; perché telescope parli ? why don &apos;t you talk ? &quot;
now , our environment begins for the first time to answer us .
i &apos;m just going to show you some examples -- again , with the idea of our environment .
let &apos;s start with the insight .
now the first project i want to introduce to you is actually one of the first of our lab .
it came in italy four and a half years ago .
and what we &apos;ve done is actually to use a new kind of network that has been used on the world -- that &apos;s a mobile phone network -- and anonymous information from this network to use to understand how the city works .
the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
it was , as a italy , the world &apos;s world championship won .
some of you will remember , it was playing as italy against france , and then at the end of the quote , the head .
and no matter , italy won on the end .
now you &apos;re looking at what happened in this day just watching the activity that happens in the network .
here you see the city .
you can see in the middle of the massive , the fluter .
at the morning , before the game .
you see the timeline up there .
afternoon , people here and there , the calls of calls and moving .
the game starts -- silence .
france does an tor . italy makes an tor .
half-time , people do a quick call , go on toilet .
second half . end of regular play time .
first extension , second .
cidane , in a moment of head .
italy wins . yeah .
well , in this night , everybody went to the center to celebrate .
they saw the big blow .
the next day , all of you went to the center of the temple team and the prime minister at the same time .
and then everybody went down .
you see the picture of the fence circo massimo , where , since the roman time , people go to celebrate -- to have a big party , and you can see the bottom of the day .
now , this is just an example of how we can feel the city today in a way that we couldn &apos;t do it a few years ago .
again , another example of feeling : here &apos;s not about people , but to use things that we use and consume .
well , today we know about where our things come from .
this is a map that shows you all the chips that have a mac computer , as they came together .
but we only know a little bit about where things go .
so in this project , we actually designed a couple of little markers to track the garbage during the system .
so we started with some volunteers that were helping us a little more than a year ago , and in seattle , the things that they would throw away -- different kinds of things like you can see -- things that they would throw away .
then we have the little chips that put small brands on the trash and start tracking it .
here are the results that we &apos;re getting right now .
from seattle ...
after a week .
with this information , we realized that there &apos;s a lot of inefficials in the system .
we can do the same things in fact with less energy .
the data wasn &apos;t available before .
but this is happening a lot of inuseful transportes and more things .
but the other thing is , we believe that if we see every day , that the cup that we throw away doesn &apos;t just disappear , that they &apos;re still on the planet somewhere .
and the plastic bottle that we &apos;re going to throw away is still there .
and if we show that to people , we can move a change change .
so that &apos;s the reason for this project .
my colleague at mit , assaf biderman , could still tell you a lot more about the insight and the many other wonderful things that you can do with insight , tell , but i want to go to the second part of our environment , and this is the integration of our environment .
and the first project is something that we did a few years ago in zaragoza , spain .
it started with a question of civil meisters who came to us and said that spain and southern europe have a beautiful tradition to use public places as part of the architecture .
and the question was : how could technology combine new technology ?
and one of the ideas that were sent to work in a workforce was , imagine these smart , and valves , magnetic valves , valves that open up and close .
they do something like a water set of images from water .
if this picture falls down , you can write it , you can write patterns , images , text ads .
and you can approach it , and it will open up to jump through it , like you can see on this picture .
well , we introduced the mayor hole .
it really liked him .
and we got the mission to design a building at the entrance of the expo .
we called it the digital water pavillion .
the whole building was underwater .
there &apos;s no doors or windows , but if you approach it , it will open up and leave it in .
the roof was covered with water also .
and when it &apos;s windy , if you want to reduce the syringes , you can even drop the roof down .
or you could close the building and the whole architecture , as in this case , you know , this days , when you go down the roof , you get pictures of people who were there and say , &quot; you &apos;ve lost the building . &quot;
no , they didn &apos;t kill the building ; it &apos;s just that architecture almost disappears .
here you see the building works .
you see the person who asks what happens inside .
and here you can see me when i was trying to test the test of the sensors that opened the water , not getting wet .
now , i should tell you what happened to one night when all the sensors stopped working .
but actually , in this night , it was even greater fun at night .
all the children from zaragoza came to the building , because the way they played with the building was very different .
no longer a building that would open up to open it up , but a building that still had a pause and holes in the water , you had to jump now without getting wet .
and that was , for us , very exciting , because as architects , engineers , as designers , we always think about how people use things we design .
but reality is always unpredictable .
and that &apos;s the beauty of creating things that are used and interact with people .
so here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical imagery , the imagery points of water and the projections on it .
and this is what made us think about the following project i &apos;m going to show you .
imagine that this image could actually start to fly .
imagine you could have small helicopter that fly through the air , and every one of them with a small image with intermediate light -- almost like a cloud that can move through the space .
here &apos;s the video .
imagine a helicopter that you saw earlier , that moves with other people , completely in synchrony .
you can have these cloud .
you can have a kind of flexible screen or display , like this -- a smooth formation in two dimensions .
or unregular , in three dimensions , where what changes the light is not the position of the imagery .
you can play in different ways .
imagine the screen could appear just in different formats or sizes in different ways .
but then the whole thing could be just a 3d cloud of points that you can go to and move through that you can look at from many , many directions .
so here you can see a real flyfire-controlled controller that goes down to form like a long time ago .
if you turn the light on , it looks like this . so , as we &apos;ve seen before .
imagine that every single one of people is being run .
it could have a impulse that everybody has a impulse that comes from people , from the movement of people or whatever .
i want to show you something here first .
we worked with robert to bolle , one of the best balatrical dancers of our time -- the étole at the metropolitan theater in new york , and the scien in maan -- we &apos;ve taken his movement in 3d to use it as a impulse for the flyfire .
here you see robert to dance .
on the left , you see the imagery points , the different kind of input .
it &apos;s at the same time a real-time 3d scan and a movement .
so you can understand the whole movement .
you can do that all the time .
but then , once we all have the imagery , you can play with it and play with color movement and shoot .
we want to use that as a possible impulse for the flyfire .
i want to show you the latest project that we &apos;re working on .
it &apos;s something that we &apos;re working on for the olympics in london .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
and the idea is , again , imagine that we take people to do something about it and change the environment -- almost like we call it , to build clouds like you &apos;re moving , but with a cloud .
imagine that everybody can give a little donation for a picture .
i think that the remarkable part of what &apos;s happening last year , the last decades , is that we are transformed from a physical world to a digital world .
it &apos;s all digitized , knowledge , and it makes it accessible by the internet .
today , we can get to the first time -- and the campaign has shown this -- we can get from the digital world to move from the digital world to the physical world .
that can be , in our case , that we use it to design and create a symbol .
this is something that &apos;s built in the city .
but tomorrow , it can take us to challenge the challenges -- think about climate change or co2 emissions -- how can we move from the digital world to physical .
so the idea is that we actually engage the people in which they do things together .
the cloud is again a cloud of points , in the same way as a real cloud is a cloud of particles .
and these particles are water , as our cloud is a cloud of points .
it &apos;s a physical material in london , but with imagery .
you can move in and make different kinds of experiences .
you can actually look at it from the bottom , the most important moments of olympia 2012 and darches , and use it as a kind of connection to the community .
so both the physical cloud in the sky and something that you can go on at its top , how lonon new mountain summit .
you can go inside .
and a kind of digital truchtower in the night -- but as most important , a new kind of experience for everybody who wants to go to the top .
thank you .
as an artist , the relationship is very important .
through my work , i try to express that people are not separate from nature and that everything is connected to each other .
the first time i was in antarctica 10 years ago in antarctica , where i saw my first iceberg .
awe of awe .
my heart raste , i was confused , while i was trying to believe what was in front of me .
the ice mountains around me , 60 feet from the water , and i could only wonder that this was a snowroom on a different shelves , year after year .
ice mountains are born as calf of a glacier , and they break out of ice .
every ice mountain has its own individual personality .
they &apos;re interacting with their environment and their experiences .
some refused to give up and grab up to the bitter end , while other people don &apos;t stand , and in a case of dramatic passion .
if you look at an ice mountain , you think they &apos;re isolated , separated and alone , as we see people often .
but the truth is far away .
as a ice mountain melts , i breathed his own atmosphere .
during the ice mountain , he melts minerals rich drinking water , which is a lot of life forms .
i &apos;m going to go to my photographs of this ice mountains as if i would make portraits of my ancestors , where consciousness is that they exist in these individual eye moments , and never exist again .
it &apos;s not a death when you melt ; it &apos;s not an end , but it &apos;s a sequel of your pathways along the way .
part of the ice in the ice ice that i &apos;m in is very young -- some thousand years old .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
the last images i &apos;d like to show you , show a ice mountain that i put in clubs in cairo .
very rare , you &apos;re actually witnessing a fan of ice .
here it is .
on the left , you see a little boat .
that &apos;s about five feet long .
please look at the shape of the iceberg and where it &apos;s on the water line .
you can see here , he starts to roll , and the boat has moved to the other side , the man stands there .
this is the average size of a giant ice cap .
he ruins about 120 feet from the water , or 40 feet .
and this video is in real time .
and just like that , it shows you a different side of his personality .
thank you .
my life is really extraordinarily blessed by the work of some amazing projects .
but the coolest thing i ever worked on was this guy .
his name is temple .
temple was one of the leading graffiti artist of the 1980s .
then , one day , he came back from walking and said , &quot; paps , my legs . &quot;
and that was the outbreak of the one .
temple is completely paralyzed today .
he can only use his eyes .
i told him .
so i have a company that makes design and animation , so it &apos;s an inevitable part of what we admire in the arts world and pay attention .
so we decided , tony -- temple -- and his thing to support .
i met with his father and his brother , and he said , &quot; we &apos;ll give you this money .
what are you going to do with it ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk to tony again .
i just want to talk to him again , and i said , &quot; wait a minute , isn &apos;t that -- i &apos;ve seen stephen hawking -- can &apos;t communicate all the paralyzed people with this device ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , only if you heard to higher social record and have a remarkable insurance , you can really do that .
ordinary people are not available to these devices . &quot;
and i said , &quot; how do you communicate ? &quot;
did anybody see the movie &quot; butterfly and hear bell &quot; ?
so they communicate -- their fingers walk along .
i &apos;m like , &quot; very archacally , how can that be ? &quot;
so i came up with the need , just to put a check , and i put a check out of it , which i didn &apos;t have the best idea , how to solve it .
i commit to place , and i &apos;m going to his brother , and his father -- with the words , &quot; well , my proposal is , tony will speak , we &apos;ll get a machine and we &apos;ll find a way that he can make his art again .
because it &apos;s a farce that someone who &apos;s still wearing all this is not to communicate . &quot;
so i spoke for a few months later .
i met these people from grl , graffiti research lab , and they have a technology that allows them to put a light on any surface and then draw a laser pointer on any surface and then draw it on a laser pointer .
so they pull around and they make art installations like this .
they say all things that are shown up there will follow a life cycle .
it starts with the burdials , and then the geeks come out , and then the bush &apos;s eyes , and finally , people do art .
but there was always a life cycle in your presentation .
so i went home and ate with my wife , and i told her of everything , and we thought , &quot; well , once there &apos;s this technology that you can use to use your eyes to control things , then we should find a way to control a laser , that it would be great . &quot;
that was the beginning of the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a lot of organization and a lot of things , we &apos;ve achieved some things .
first of all , we have the insurance revolving the doors , and we actually have to get a device that he can communicate with -- a stephen hawkene machine .
that was incredible .
and he &apos;s really quite funny -- i call him yoda , because you talk to him , or get an email , and thinks , &quot; i &apos;m so unworthy , this guy is incredible . &quot;
also , we &apos;ve taken seven programmers from all over the world -- literally from all the corners of the world -- to us home .
my wife , my kids and i are moved into the garage , and those hackers and programmers and the conspiracy and conspiracy have taken over our house .
many of our friends thought that we were pretty stupid to do that and that we would come back and be all the images on the walls .
but for over two weeks , we were programmed , we went to the beach provenction in venice , my children became involved in my dog and we created this .
it &apos;s called eyewriters , and you can see the description .
this is a cheap sunglasses that we bought on the beach promenade of venice , something copper wire and a few things out of the building market and the electric genesis .
we took a pile of camera , they have moved apart , they put on a led light , and now we have a device that &apos;s open -- you can build it yourself , we can build the code free to download the software for free .
so we have created a device that &apos;s completely free of constraints .
no insurance can make it worthwhile .
no hospital .
now , every paralyzed can actually communicate alone with his eyes or draw .
thank you .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to temple room .
i love this picture because it &apos;s somebody else &apos;s room , and that &apos;s his room .
now , there &apos;s all of these tours before the great unveiling .
and after a year of planning , two weeks of programmable work , nodelparties and running seams , tony drew for the first time to seven years .
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and he looks beyond his life support system .
we &apos;ve tilted his bed so he can see it outside .
we set up a projector against a wall of the park in the hospital .
and he drew back to the first time , in his family and friends -- and you can just imagine what a sense that was on the parking lot .
we also had to break into the parking lot , so we felt as part of the spray scene .
at the end of the sand he gave us an email with the contents of the content , &quot; for the first time for seven years .
i feel like i was drawn underwater , and finally someone has moved down and pulled up my head so i can breathe . &quot;
isn &apos;t it overwhelming ?
this is something like our fight .
that keeps us at the end of the pole , and we keep moving on .
and we have to improve a lot of this device .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s a magic chart right now .
and someone who has such an artist deserves so much more .
so we &apos;re in figuring out how to make it better , faster and stronger .
since that time we have all kinds of recognition .
we won a few awards .
remember , it &apos;s free , no one deserves to do it .
it &apos;s all from our own pockets .
so they were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
armstrong twitterte over us , and then in december , the time magazine honored us when one of the 50 best inventions was in 2010 .
the coolest thing about it is -- and that includes the whole circle -- that this april , mophemoca will be a show called &quot; art of the streets . &quot;
and there may be pretty much the toughest representatives of the street scene of art scene -- banking , shepard &apos;s new speaker , caws -- all these guys are going to be there .
temple will be part of the show , which is quite balanced .
so basically , if you look at something that &apos;s impossible , it can do it .
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this microphone , the eyewriter -- everything was impossible .
make it possible -- you all here .
i &apos;m not a programmer , and i had never to do anything with rival technology , but i just raised something and surrounded me with amazing people so that we could put something on the legs .
and this question should be , every single day , and every single day , where you noticed something that needs to be done , if not now , when and if not me , who ?
thank you .
so , i write for children , and i &apos;m probably america most likely children &apos;s author .
and i always say to people that i don &apos;t want to get like a scientist .
you can have me as a farmer , or in leather , but nobody has ever chosen any farmer .
today i want to tell you about circles and disagreement .
well , a epiphany is usually something you find because you &apos;ve dropped it somewhere .
you go around the block and you take it as a revelation .
this is a painting of a circle .
one of my friends did it -- richard flop .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle that i want to tell you today .
my circle started in the &apos; 60s at high school in the &apos; 60s , ohio , where i was the classroom .
i was the one who was beaten every week in the black toilet green and blue , until a teacher saved my life .
she saved my life by putting me the toilet in teacher &apos;s room .
that &apos;s what she did .
she did it for three years .
and i had to get away from the city .
i had a thumb , i had 85 dollars , and it struck me to san francisco in california -- i found a lover -- and then in the &apos; 80s , i found it a work in aids .
about three or four years ago , i received a phone call from this teacher , woman post , who said , &quot; i have to see you .
i &apos;m sad that we &apos;ve never learned each other as adults .
you can come to ohio , and please come together with the guy i know you &apos;ve found .
and i should say that i have a builduette tree tree , and i want you to stay there . &quot;
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
we looked at them , we laughed , we kissed , and we knew she had to be in a hospice .
we found one for them , we brought them down , and we went around them , and we gave eight , because it needed it .
it was something we knew .
and just as the woman who wanted to know me as adults , i learned , they turned into a box , and walked in my hands .
what happened was that the circle was closed , it was a circle -- and the revelation of that i talked about .
the revelation is , death is part of life .
she saved my life , and my partner and i saved her .
and you know , this part of life needs everything the rest of life needs .
he needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so glad that this is so often mentioned today .
he needs the same -- he would need , love and pleasure . and it &apos;s on us to give these things .
thank you .
imagine a big explosion , as you go to 1,000 feet .
imagine an airplane full of smoke .
imagine a driver &apos;s work , the blade , sniack , liack , liack , liack , liack , bitack , sliack .
that sounds scary .
well , i had a unique place on this day ; i sat on 1d .
i was the only one who was able to talk to flight .
so i looked at it right now , and they said , &quot; no problem , we &apos;ve probably caught some birds . &quot;
the pilot had ordered the machine , and we were not so far away .
you could see manhattan .
two minutes later , three things happened simultaneously .
the pilot built the machine after the hudson river .
it &apos;s usually not the route .
it goes off the driver .
imagine a soundless airplane .
and then he said three words -- the smartest words i &apos;ve ever heard .
he says , &quot; give up to the rise . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the lunch staff anymore .
i could see it in their eyes because it was horror to end life .
i want to share with you three things that i learned about this day .
i learned that in a moment , everything is different .
we have this plan , we have these things that we &apos;d like to do in life , and i thought of all the people i wanted to do , and it didn &apos;t act , all the fences i wanted to do , and never did .
while i was thinking about it later , a saying is , &quot; i collect bad wines . &quot;
because if the wine is as far and the person is there , i open it .
i never want to move something into life .
and that urgency , this goal , has changed my life .
the second thing that i learned on this day -- and that was when we failed the george washington bridge , pretty much about haireswide -- i thought , man , there &apos;s one thing i really regret .
i had a good life .
in my own humanity , and with my mistakes , i proceed to become better in everything i grabbed .
but i &apos;ve also given my ego to my ego .
and i took the time that i wasted for meaningful things , with people who mean something .
and i thought about the relationship with my wife , to my friends .
and after that , when i was thinking about it , i decided to put negative energy from my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
i didn &apos;t meet two years more with my wife .
it feels great .
i &apos;m not trying to have , right ? i &apos;ll decide to be happy .
the third thing i learned -- and while the inner clock starts , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 , ... &quot; down .
you see the water coming .
i said , &quot; please flying into the air . &quot;
i don &apos;t want this thing to break into 20 parts , like you know it from a documentary .
as we fall down , i had this feeling of being human , not frightening .
almost as if we were to prepare our lives for life .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and this sadness , really , in a thought , is that i just wanted one thing .
i just wish i could grow up my children .
about a month after that , i went to a performance of my daughter -- first graders , not a lot of artistic talent ...
not yet .
and i dance , i &apos;m like a little kid .
and in the world , everything had a sense for me .
i realized that by the time i connected the dots , it &apos;s only about being a great father .
more than anything , everything else is my only goal in life , a good father .
i didn &apos;t have the wonder to die that day .
i got another gift , which is to see in the future , and come back and get different .
my call to everybody who flies today is : imagine the same thing happens on your flight -- don &apos;t -- but imagine it ; and how would you change ?
what would you do to push it up because you think they were forever there ?
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in it ?
and more than anything else , are they the best parents they can only be ?
thank you .
the idea behind the stuxnet computer worm is pretty simple .
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bomb .
the most important post there for the development of nuclear weapons is the ancient incentives in nato .
the gray ones that you see here are real-time control systems .
now , when it comes to us , the systems and the systems that control the numbers and valves can actually cause a lot of problems with the centrifuge .
these gray boxes are not running with windows software ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
but if we can do it , a more effective wave virus on a laptop is used by an actor engineer using these gray box , then we &apos;re in business .
and that &apos;s the planning behind stuxnet .
so we start with a winsal drone .
the use of data is transgenerated into the gray box , damaged the centrifuge and the irish nuclear energy program -- mission accomplished .
this is a child play , right ?
i want to tell you how we &apos;ve found that .
when we launched our research six months ago , it was completely unknown , which was the meaning and purpose of this construction .
the only thing that we knew is very , very complicated , which is the winsal part of it , the drone -- part , he made a number of pieces of floo- daycollar use .
and it seemed something to have with these gray boxes , this real-time -- control systems .
so this triggered our attention , and we started a lab -- project where we infected our environment with stuxnet , and we looked at this constructed .
and then something funny happened .
stuxnet held like a lab rat that didn &apos;t love our cheese -- snick , but didn &apos;t want to eat it .
that didn &apos;t make sense in my eyes .
and when we experimented with different kinds of cheese , i went to that this is a targeted attack .
completely on a particular goal .
the dropper tag on the gray box when a special configuration has been discovered , even if the special program , which is trying to infect it on this destination .
and if not , they don &apos;t do anything .
so , that was really my interest and we started working , almost around the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
it could be , say , a u.s. power plant , or a chemical plant in germany .
so we should soon find out what the goal is .
so extrahiined , and we found the attack code and found that it &apos;s in two digital warheads -- a smaller and a larger one .
and we also realized that they were very professionally designed by people who obviously had all of this information .
they knew any bits and bypressed that they had to attack .
they even knew the sheer size of the machine interface .
so they knew everything .
and if you have already , the drone of stuxnet complex and high-tech , let me tell you , the data is a science for itself .
it &apos;s much more sophisticated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
here you see a clip from this attack . code .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 lines code .
looks pretty much like old-fashioned hype language .
and i want to tell you how we were able to get smart from this code .
so what we were looking for first , we were operating systems , because we know what these are doing .
and then we looked for tikers and data structures and tried to bring them to the real world -- with potential goals in the real world .
so we needed theories about these goals that we could measure or dissolve .
in order to make these theories , we call ourselves memory that it &apos;s definitely about high curches , it &apos;s got to be a high-quality goal , and it &apos;s very likely to be in iran because most of the infections have been emitted .
now , in this area , there isn &apos;t several thousand targets .
basically , it &apos;s going beyond the bucker nuclear power plant and on the uranium facility in nato .
so i said to my assistant , &quot; bring me a list of all the experts for centrility and power of our client . &quot;
and i called them up and pump their knowledge to compare their expertise to what we found in the code and in the data .
and that worked very well .
so , it was possible to bring the little digital exploding with the rotorstream in connection .
the rotor is this moving part within the centrifuge , these black object that you see .
and if you multiply the speed of this rotating , you &apos;re actually able to crack the rotor , and eventually , the centrifuge explode .
what we &apos;ve also found is that the goal of the attack was actually slow , and to make it clear -- obviously , in the attempt to allow engineers to go out quickly .
the great digital exploding -- we got a glimpse by looking at very precisely data and data structures .
so for example , the number 164 bites out of this code ; you can &apos;t miss it .
i began to work with scientific literature about how these centriians are being built in nato and found that they are structured in what they call the kaskaden , and every kaskad contains 164 centriths .
so that made sense to fit it together .
and it got better .
these centrility in iran is shared levels in 15 layers .
and guess what we found in the sky code ?
almost identical structure .
so again , that fit really well together .
and this gave us great confidence that we studied here .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , not just that .
these results have been achieved by several weeks of work .
and often we ran into a dead pole and we had to recollect .
anyway , we found that both digital warheads in reality were actually on one and the same goal , but from different directions .
the small exploding takes over a caskade , and overturn the rotors and slowed them down and the large exploding starts with six castads in interaction and manipulating .
so , in the large and all of us , we are very hopeful that we actually have what the goal is .
it &apos;s natasha &apos;s and it &apos;s just natasha .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that other goals could be made by stuxnet .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we discovered -- got me out of sows .
there &apos;s the gray box down there , and there you see the centrility .
now , what this thing is doing is that it &apos;s beginning to decline the values of sensors -- for example , of print sensors and vibrational sensors -- and it provides legitims code that are still during the attack with false input .
and in fact , this false data is recorded from stuxnet before .
so it &apos;s just like in hollywood movies , where during the record hunt , the surveillance hunt is fed up with a little bit of video .
that &apos;s cool , isn &apos;t it ?
the idea here is obviously not only , the engine administration in the control room .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and more aggressive .
the idea is to overlist a digital security system .
we need digital security systems where a human machine interface can &apos;t respond fast enough .
so , for example , in a power plant , if the big steam tower becomes too fast , you &apos;ve got to open off within milliseconds .
of course , this can &apos;t be done by a human machine leader .
so this is where we need digital security systems .
and if you &apos;re at risk , really bad things can happen .
the power plant can explode .
and neither the machine leaders , even the security system will notice it .
that &apos;s scary .
but it gets worse .
and what i &apos;m saying now is very important .
think about it . that attack is generic .
it has nothing to do with centrility , with uranium .
so , for example , he would work as well -- in a power station or in a car factory .
it &apos;s generic .
and you don &apos;t have to -- as the attacker -- you don &apos;t have to get the data on a usb- stick , how we saw it at stuxnet .
you could also use ordinary worm technology to spread .
you just have to spread it as far as you can .
and if you do that , eventually you get an cyberweapon of mass destruction .
that &apos;s the implication we have to ask .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of goals is not in the middle east .
they &apos;re in the united states , in europe and japan .
so all these green areas , these are the richest environments .
we need to put the consequences and we start ready to prepare .
thank you .
i have a question .
ralph , it was reported a lot of it , that people assume that the yves sad is the main organization behind it .
is that your opinion ?
okay , you really want to know ?
yeah . okay .
i think it &apos;s the tyler sad , but the driving force is not israel .
so the driving force behind it is the cybersuperpower .
there &apos;s only one and the united states -- luckily , for happiness .
because otherwise our problem would be even bigger .
thank you for inviting us a shit . thank you ralph .
i spent the last few years to place myself in situations that are usually very difficult and sort of dangerous at the same time .
i went to jail -- hard .
i worked in a coal camp -- dangerous .
i filmed in war areas -- hard and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days doing nothing like this -- at the beginning , a little difficult in the middle , very dangerous at the end .
in fact , i &apos;ve been covering the biggest part of my career to terrible situations , and it &apos;s all about trying to study social bellong times that they &apos;re compelling and interesting , and hopefully a kind of understanding what makes them fun for the audience and make it accessible .
so when i knew that i was going to come here to look at the world in a tedtalk of branding and sponsters , i knew that i would do a little different .
some of you may have heard that i &apos;ve turned an ad on ebay a few weeks ago .
i sent a few facebook messages , some twitter news , and i gave people the opportunity to stand the naming on my tedtalk 2011 .
really , some happy people and companies , chloropprofits and deprivation , got the unique opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris anderson never will let it go again -- the name is not going to have a lot of content , and not a lot of evidence of what that would be like at the time .
so what you got was this : your name presented here : my tedtalk , from which you don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to be , and the one that ever happens to you after the ears , especially if i stand your company stupid .
but besides , it &apos;s a very good medium opportunity .
you know how many people look at these tedtalks ?
a lot .
that &apos;s just the workbook .
so , despite this warning , i knew anybody would buy naming .
now , if you asked me this a year ago , i wouldn &apos;t have been able to tell you this with sure .
but in the new project i work on , my new film , we study the world of marketing , the advertising .
as i said , i went through a couple of pretty awful situations over the years , but nothing could prepare me , couldn &apos;t get me to the very hard and so dangerous with these guys in a room .
you know , i had the idea for a movie .
what i &apos;d like to do is make a film , and marketing , marketing and advertising , where all the film is funded by computing , marketing and advertising .
and the movie is going to be &quot; the realist , ever . &quot;
so what happens in &quot; the &quot; the &quot; spoofer ever , &quot; is that everything from above to the bottom , from the beginning to end , is totally covered with brands -- from the cover , which you &apos;re going to see in the movie , that &apos;s the brand .
now this brand , the quality stadium , the center center ...
these guys are going to be connected to this film forever .
and so the film is going to study this whole idea -- that &apos;s what ? in infinity , forever ?
i &apos;m a redundant person .
that was more to the concrete .
it was &quot; in hot , forever . &quot;
but we &apos;re not only going to have the brand racing as a cover , but we will ensure that we &apos;re going to sell every possible category in the movie .
we may be selling a shoe and he &apos;s going to sell the greatest shoe you &apos;ve ever carried ...
the greatest car that you &apos;ve ever gotten out of , from &quot; the manchester , ever , &quot; the greatest drink of drinks that you &apos;ve ever had , is a attention of &quot; the nih ever . &quot;
so the idea is , besides showing that brands are part of the life , is it actually to get the film to fund ?
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
the goal of the whole film is transparency .
you &apos;re going to see the whole thing in the movie .
so that &apos;s the whole concept , the whole film , from the beginning to end .
and i would be happy if ceg would help to do this .
you know , it &apos;s funny , because when i first heard it , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience .
but i don &apos;t know how to blame people .
do you have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use &quot; perspective , &quot; because that has a negative connotation -- but you know how to develop ?
how much money is needed to realize that ?
1.5 million .
i think it &apos;s going to be hard to meet , but i think it &apos;s worth it anyway , some really familiar brands .
now , who knows when the film comes out , we may look like a prosthetic vollite .
what do you think the answer will be ?
the answer is very likely to be , &quot; no . &quot;
but is it a difficult thing for the movie or a difficult thing for me to do ?
jk : both .
so , not so optimistic .
so , sir , you can help me ? i need help .
i can help .
okay .
fantastic .
we need to think about what brands .
yeah .
if you look at the people you have to do it ...
there are some places we can apply to .
imagine the camera .
i thought , &quot; imagine the camera &quot; would mean that we wanted to take a background .
it turns out it really meant , &quot; we want to have nothing to do with your movie . &quot;
and just so all these companies disappeared , one after another .
no one wanted to have something to do with the movie .
i was amazed .
they didn &apos;t want to do absolutely nothing with the project .
and i was confused because i thought the whole concept , the idea of advertising , is your product so many people as possible to present it , so many people like you can see .
especially in the world today , at this intersection of new and old media , and the deformed media -- it &apos;s not the idea of being in this new exciting response instrument that the masses are taking this message .
no , that was what i thought .
but look , the problem was that my idea had a fatal mistake , and that was the following .
actually no , that was not the mistake .
it wouldn &apos;t have been a problem at all .
that would have been okay .
but what this picture is , is a problem .
you see , if you &apos;re transparency search in google search , this is one of the first images that seems .
i really like your way , sergey brin .
that was the problem : transparency -- free of deception and whistles , just to discover and look through ; character characterized by visual ability and access to information , especially what business levels are of -- especially , what business levels are of .
you know , we &apos;re listening to a lot of transparency right now .
our politicians say it , our president says , even our ceo .
but when it comes to that it &apos;s going to change , something is changing .
but why ? well , transparency is scary -- like this curious bear , still nails .
it &apos;s unpredictable -- like this strange area .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
what else is more risky ?
a whole dish , cool sensing .
this is very risky .
so when i started talking to companies and tell them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
you see , when i was a kid , and my dad came up with the lie -- and there he goes and looked at me with this -- he would say , &quot; my son , there &apos;s three versions .
there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the real version . &quot;
so you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the real version .
but there was only one company that was ready to help us -- and that &apos;s just because i know john bond and richard kirshentree for years -- i found that i had to do it alone , i had to deal with the middle man and go directly with my team .
so what you suddenly started to understand -- or what i started to understand -- was that if you start talking to these companies , the idea of talking about how your brand is understood , a bigger problem .
i have friends who make great , gigantic hollywood movies , and i have friends who are doing little couchnest movies like me .
and my friends , the great , gigantic hollywood movies , say that the reason why their films are so successful to the brand is that they have .
and then my friends , who make little couchacts movies , &quot; well , how do we compete with these big gigantic movies ? &quot;
and the movie is called &quot; the nih ever . &quot;
so how exactly are we going to see wine in the movie ?
whenever i go to the way , and whenever i open up the board , you &apos;re going to see maroodorant .
and every time i interview somebody , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ?
are you at the same time ? you see a little nervous .
i want to help you calm up .
so maybe you should put a little bit of this on the interview . &quot;
and then we offer one of these great grim things .
either &quot; flego fusion &quot; or a paradise wind , they will have the choice .
we &apos;re being equipped both for men and for women as well as for women -- it &apos;s clear , or a stick , whatever .
that &apos;s the short volume .
now , i can answer all your questions and give them an excuse .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
as you &apos;ve talked about the smaller movies , we are a marker .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other brands .
so doing these things -- you know , remind people of ban -- that &apos;s sort of why we &apos;re interested .
which words would you describe to ban ?
ban is couch.
that &apos;s a great question .
gelegene technology .
technology is not the way to describe something that someone does under the rollles .
we talk about bold , fresh .
i think , &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word that these category really makes something positive , unlike &quot; battle odor and humidity . &quot;
it keeps you fresh .
how can we keep them fresh -- better fresh , more fresh , three , three .
these things have a more positive effect .
and this is a million-company company .
what about me ? what about the prints ?
i have to talk to the guy on the street , which is like me , nito-normal consumers .
you should tell me something about my brand .
how would you describe your brand ?
hmmm , my brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i really like nice clothes .
&apos; 80s revival meets skon , except on the sink day .
all right , what is the brand ?
unique .
i think the gene that i have is probably &quot; dark glamour . &quot;
i like a lot of black colors , many gray sounds and stuff .
but normally , i have a accessing , like sunglasses , or a jewelry and so on .
if dan was a brand , he would probably be a classic merceder cabrio .
the brand i &apos;m , i would say , i would say , pure fly .
that part hippie , part yogi , part brooklyn girl -- i don &apos;t know .
man 3 : i &apos;m the sword guy .
i dress across the country in the entire country .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
this is my brand in my little distorted industry .
man 4 : my brand is fedex , because i was more lonely .
brand five : brand alcohol scream .
is this going ?
lawyer : i &apos;m an anwaltsry .
i &apos;m tom .
well , we can &apos;t all be the tom-brand , but i often look at the interface of dark glamour and junk fly .
and what &apos;s noticed was that i needed a experts .
i needed someone who could come into my head , someone who really could help me understand what &apos;s called the &quot; branded personality . &quot;
and so i found a company called olson zallman in pittsburgh burg .
they &apos;ve helped companies like nepy , landroze , hallmark helped to discover this brand .
if you could do it , you could also help me .
they brought their pictures , yes ?
i have this . the first picture is a picture of my family .
just tell me a little bit about how that is connected to your thoughts and feelings about themselves .
these are the people who form my world view .
tell me about this world .
md : this world ? i think the world is the world in which you live -- how people around you , the friends , the way you live your life , the work and so on .
all of these things come and start from a place , and for me , they come and start with my family in west virginia .
what is the next thing you want to talk about .
the next . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
what context is that to the thought and feelings about themselves ?
it &apos;s like i &apos;d like to be .
i like things that are different .
i like things that are weird . i like weird things .
tell me about the &quot; why &quot; -- what does it bring us ?
what &apos;s the machete ? what puppers are they right now ?
why is it important to start novelty ? what represents the red ?
tell me a little bit about this part .
a little more about you , you &apos;re not .
what other metals have they gone through ?
you don &apos;t have to be afraid . what kind of rolleraster are you ?
free-eeee ! no , thank you .
thank you very much for your patience .
yeah . all right .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to come out of it .
there was a lot of crazy things going on there .
the first thing that i saw was this idea that their branding of their brand was two separate , but at the end of the side -- the morgan rides is an eight-/ an an eight-/ an agent .
the complities are very good .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction with it .
and i think some companies are just going to focus on a strength instead of both .
many companies tend to -- and that &apos;s the human nature -- to avoid things that they &apos;re not sure , they &apos;re going to be afraid to avoid these elements , and that they &apos;re going to make them really positive , and they &apos;re going to make them really positive in themselves .
what other brands do they do ?
the first one is a classic , apple .
and you can see it here , target , wii , mini from mini coopers and frontal blue .
well , there are brands , and mindically brands , these things that come and go , but one of them played , eight key brand is a very strong thing .
an eight-degree , was it called a brand . how is your brand ?
if somebody asked you to describe your brand identity , your brand personality , how would you ?
she &apos;s going to give them a meeting ? are they something that &apos;s bringing blood into boxes ?
or are you more likely to get down ?
are you something a little quiet , more conservative , conservative ?
up , things are things that matter , fresh like the baseball prince , time , adventurous , outfall , and love like terol flynn , agile and mystical and mystical and mystical and mystical and mystical .
or are they more like a stemp ?
are you eight words and monvn like 47 ?
are they established , traditionally , care , affordable , compassionate , like oprah ?
are they reliable , stable , family , safe , divorctable , condurance , and how the dalai lama or yoda ?
in the course of the film , we had more than 500 companies that were up and down companies and the &quot; no &quot; because they didn &apos;t want to be part of the project .
they didn &apos;t want to do anything with this film , because they didn &apos;t have control , no control about the finished product .
but , in fact , 17 brand partners who were willing to get on these control , who wanted to do business with people who wanted to do their business as eight as i could , and then , and finally , that helped us tell stories that would never support a value .
it enables us to tell the story of neuromarketing , as we tell the story in this film that you &apos;re using now mri to make the fun centers of the brain , both for advertising and films .
we went to sao paulo , where foreign advertising was banned .
in the entire city , since five years , there &apos;s no posters , no poster , no flips , nothing .
and we drove in school districts , in which companies are in their way schools , in all america .
the incredible thing for me is that the projects that i got most of the feedback , or where i had the biggest success , those are where i was interacting with things .
and that &apos;s what these brands did .
because they went around the middle man , they went to the agencies , and they said maybe the agencies don &apos;t really have their interest in mind .
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artist .
i &apos;m going to work with him and create something completely different , something that people get to think that our world challenge is challenging .
and how was that for you ? what is it successful ?
now , because the film festival was going on , we can look at this .
according to burrdian was the first thing in january , and since -- and that &apos;s not even the whole thing -- there were 900 million calls of this film .
this is actually just one of two / two weeks .
this is just online -- no press , no television .
the film hasn &apos;t been balanced yet .
there &apos;s not even online . there &apos;s no entry .
he hasn &apos;t come out in other countries .
well , finally , the film has gained a very big momentum .
and that &apos;s not bad for a project where almost every commercial agency , which we talked about , has recommended their clients , the fingers of that .
what i firmly believe is that if you look at your chance , you take risks that in these risks .
i think if you keep people out of it , you get it closer to failure .
i believe that if you train your employees to avoid risk , you have the whole company to get a profit .
i feel that we need to encourage people to take risks .
we need to encourage people to have no fear of opportunity that might be afraid .
finally , when we move forward , we should welcome fear .
we should put the bear in the cage .
they &apos;re going to be welcome to fear . they &apos;re welcome to the risk .
one big lion , we welcome the risk .
and finally , we should welcome transparency .
now , more than ever before , a little bit of honesty is very far from us .
and that said , with honesty and transparency , my total talk , &quot; they &apos;re welcome transparency to you from my good friends of emc , who would be paying $ 100 for the name of ebay .
big data is transformed for organizations around the world in big opportunities .
emc : &quot; welcome to &quot; you transparency &quot;
thank you .
now , morgan , in the name of transparency this : what &apos;s happening to the $ 100 ?
that &apos;s a great question .
i have a check in my pocket , and i put on the top of the ted organization , the saop foundation -- a check in the height of 7100 to fund my ted performance next year .
my name is amit .
18 months ago , i did something else in google , and i realized to do something with museums and art . my chethrow , which is also , i gave myself green light .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of fun negotiations and stories , i can tell you , with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the demonstration .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we &apos;ve done this .
i think my personal view is very simple with this slide and the access .
i grew up in india .
i became a great education part -- i didn &apos;t get to -- but i didn &apos;t have a lot of museums and this artwork .
when i was traveling , and i went to visit these museums , i started to learn a lot .
and while i was working for google , i tried to look at these longing -- to make art available with technology together .
we then put a team , a great team , and we started this .
i &apos;m going to start with the demonstration , and tell you some interesting things that happened since the beginning .
so you just go to yoga project.com.
you can see in all these museums here .
there &apos;s the uffizi , the moma , which , the rijks , van gogh .
i even come into one of my favorite ones , the metropolitan museum of art in new york .
you get in two ways -- very simple .
click , and wumms , you &apos;re in this museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where they are -- bombay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t make any difference .
you go around , and you have time .
you want to engage in the museum ?
open the card , and jump it with a click .
there they are , they want to end up to the end of the gang .
just further . a lot of fun .
beaching them .
thank you , but the best is coming .
so , i &apos;m in front of one of my favorite pictures , serious worker of lightning breugel in the met .
i see this mark mark .
if the museum gave us the picture , she click on it .
now this is one of the images .
these are all metadata .
those of you who are really interested in art can click here -- but i click away now .
this is one of the images we &apos;ve made with the so-called gigapix500 technology .
for example , this picture , for example , has about 10 billion points , i think .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you get for 10 billion points ? &quot;
now that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to show you .
you can just zoom in and zoom out .
you see something funny here .
i love this guy ; his expression is unaffordable .
but then you really want to put it deep in .
and so i started playing around , and i realized that there was something happening there .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
i went close , and i slowly noticed that these kids actually picked something .
i studied a little bit , spoke with a couple of familiar people , and i actually found out that it &apos;s a game called source source , where a goose is beaten at a stick tuesday with a stick .
it seemed quite popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
to really close close , you can go to the late .
just to give you the focus , i &apos;ll show you what you get .
here we were , and this is the painting .
the best thing is , in a second .
let &apos;s jump quickly to moma , again in new york .
another favorite picture of me , star night .
the first example was to find detail .
but what if you want to see the brush ?
and what if you want to see how van gogh created this master &apos;s piece ?
you zoom in . you can really go into it .
i &apos;m going to zoom into one of my favorite points of this picture , until i really am in the late .
this is starnight , probably never seen before .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
there are many more , but i &apos;m missing time .
this is really cool , it &apos;s called collections .
each of you , everybody -- the same is whether or poor , whether you have a great house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
you can go and create your own museum online -- from all these pictures , you can put your own collection .
it &apos;s just , you go in -- and i &apos;ve created this , it &apos;s called the &quot; hindu &quot; -- you can zoom around .
this is it , in the national sciences .
you can put everything on the side of your friends , and you can start a conversation about what you feel when you look at this masterpiece .
i think finally , for me , the main thing is that all the wonderful things here don &apos;t come from google .
they &apos;re not even coming from the museums .
i should not say that .
they come from the artists .
and that was an experience in humility .
i mean , i hope that we &apos;re going to be just with this digital medium of art , and they represent it properly online .
and the biggest question that i &apos;m going to ask recently is , &quot; did you do that to replicate the experience of a museum ? &quot;
the answer is no .
it should be the experience .
that &apos;s why . thank you .
thank you .
this is a representation of your brain . your brain can be split in two camps .
this is the left half , which is the logical side , and then the right half , which is the intuitive page .
if we had a measure of every hemisphere to measure the apgles , we could be able to figure her brain out .
for example , that one who is completely logical .
this would be someone who &apos;s completely intuitive .
now , where would you apply your brain to this scale ?
some of us may have decided for one of these extreme , but i think , for most people in the audience , their brain looks like this -- with a high apker that &apos;s at the same time in both hemisphere .
it &apos;s not like they &apos;re both exclusive or something like that .
you can be logical and intuitively .
and so i think of myself as one of the people in common with the most experimental quantum physics that needs a good fraction of logic to bring the complex ideas together .
but at the same time , we need a good amount of intuition to actually do the experiments .
how do we develop these intuitions ? well , we love to play things .
so we go out and we play with it , and then we look at it , and then we start to develop our intuition .
they basically do the same thing .
so one of the more intuitive you &apos;ve developed over the years is probably that a thing at the same time can be on a place .
i mean , it sounds strange about thinking that a thing is at the same time at the same time , but they &apos;re not born with this idea , they have evolved .
i remember seeing a child playing on a floor threshold .
he was a little kid and not very good at it , and he realized all the time .
but i bet that playing with the bottom threshold is a very valuable lesson , which is the big things you don &apos;t just leave over , and that you stay in a place .
and this is a great conceptual model of the world as long as they &apos;re not particle physicists .
it would be a terrible model for particle physicist , because they don &apos;t play with soil , but with these little strange particles .
and if you play with your particles , you all think of all kinds of weird things -- like flying directly through walls , or you can be at the same time at two different places .
and so they all wrote these observations , and they called the theory of quantum mechanics .
this was the state of physics a few years ago ; you needed quantum mechanics to describe the little tiny particles .
but you didn &apos;t need them to describe the great day-to-day objects around us .
this didn &apos;t make my intuition , and maybe just because i don &apos;t play games so often .
well , sometimes i play with you , but not very often .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
i mean , nobody ever saw a particle .
but my logical side has not liked it .
because if all things are made of particles and all these particles follow the rules of quantum mechanics , wouldn &apos;t it just follow the rules of quantum mechanics ?
i don &apos;t see why this should be .
so i would be able to feel better with the whole thing , if we could somehow feel that everyday objects follow the rules of quantum mechanics .
so i made a couple of years ago to do that .
i created one .
this is the first object you can see in the quantum mechanical position .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and you can see this green dot there in the middle .
that &apos;s the piece of metal that i &apos;m going to talk about .
this is a picture of the object .
so here i do something . we look right here in the center .
and here &apos;s a really big close-up of this little piece of metal .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little piece of metal it &apos;s shaped like a spring board , and it &apos;s over the edge .
so i did this thing in the same way that you make a computer chip .
i went to a clean space with a new silicon space , and rasty for 100 hours of all the big stuff .
for the last bit , i had to build my own machine -- to make this kind of swimming pool and get the thing .
this thing has the ability to be in the quantum mechanical position , but it takes a little help to do it .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you know how uncomfortable it is to be in a full elevator ?
i mean , if i &apos;m alone in the elevator , i &apos;m going to do all kinds of weird things , but then other people go up and i listen to all these things because i don &apos;t want to get it wrong .
so quantum mechanics says that unmovable objects are feeling that way .
the driver for unmovable objects are not only people , but the light that seems to you , and the wind that seems to pass over and the wind of the space .
and so we knew that if we wanted to see that this piece of metal acts of quantum mechanical , we had to pull out the whole thing .
and that &apos;s what we did .
we turned on the light , we put it into a vacuum and we got the whole air out of the air , and kissed it up to almost now in the elevator , it was the piece of metal , it was free to behave like it was always .
so we measured its movement .
we found that it really moved really strange .
instead of that it &apos;s just quiet there , vibrating it . the way it would vibrate was about this -- like a rising , and all the way up together , it &apos;s like a rising bubble .
in that we gave him a little push , we could vibrate it at the same time and not vibrate -- something that &apos;s just in the quantum mechanics .
so what i &apos;m telling you is what truly fantastic .
what does it mean to vibrate at the same time and not vibrate ?
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
so the first case : all the trillions of atoms are silent there , and at the same time , the same atoms are moving and down at the same time .
only more precise things are true .
the rest of the time they are delocalized .
that means that every atom at the same time is two different places , which is that the entire piece of metal is in two different places .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
really .
it was worth taking me into the green space for all this year , because , you know , the scale difference between a single atom and this piece of metal is about the same difference between the piece of metal and you .
so if a single atom can be at the same time at two different places , that piece of metal can be two different places , why not you ?
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logical side says .
so imagine you &apos;re at the same time at the same time , how would that feel ?
how would your conscious mind deal with your body in the room ?
there &apos;s another aspect in history .
when we turned it upside down , and the box looked inside , we saw that the piece of metal was always in a piece there .
and so i had to develop this new intuition that it looks like all the objects in the elevator actually are quant objects that are in a small room together .
you hear a lot of excuses about how quantum mechanics says that everything is connected to everything .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
there &apos;s more on it , it &apos;s still deeper .
it &apos;s that these connections , their connections with all the things around them , literally define who they are , and that &apos;s the profound and strange of quantum mechanics .
thank you .
in 2007 , i decided that we should be remodeling as we think about economic development .
it should be our goal that if families think about where they want to live and they want to work , they give them the opportunity between at least one hand full of different cities that are all in competition .
now we &apos;re far away from this goal .
there are billions of people in developing countries who don &apos;t even have a single city that they would welcome .
but the amazing thing about cities is they &apos;re so much more valuable than building it .
so we could be very simple with the world , maybe even hundreds of new cities .
now that may sound absurd for you if you &apos;ve never thought about new cities .
but just swap the building of homes against cities .
imagine half of the people who want to live in homes did this already ; the other half didn &apos;t yet .
you could try to expand the capacity of existing apartments .
but you know what you &apos;re going to do , in these homes , and the laws of your environment are laws in order to avoid disease .
so , it turns out to be very difficult to get out of all these extensions .
but you could go to a completely new place , a completely new block of living , and the laws would be used to build such a construction and not prevent .
so i &apos;ve suggested that governments create new surfaces that provide enough space for a city and gave them a name : charter cities .
later , i found that about the same time , ja4 and octavio about the challenge of a reform in honduras .
they knew that every year about 75,000 honans left their country to go into the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to make sure that these people in their country can stay and do exactly the same in honduras .
at this point , ja4 said , &quot; what happens when we &apos;re an unsetted surface of our country -- what if we just want to go to a message -- a part of the american embassy , a part of the eastern embassy , and when people want to work under one message -- a part of the eastern embassy and if people want to work , they can work , and they can do everything they would have to go to canada ? &quot;
in summer , in the summer of 2009 , honduras was suffering under a strong outbreak .
in the next planteral elections , pear lobo &apos;s in a rechanting , which is a program of both innovations , and it promised .
he asked octavio to be more stable .
so , in the meantime , i was preparing to tedglobal .
by applying , and through the study of consumers , i &apos;ve tried to reduce this complicated concept of charter city , essentially .
the first point is the importance of laws , laws that determine that you don &apos;t have to have existing residential owners .
we pay new technologies , but for the progress , it takes technologies and laws , and it &apos;s usually laws that keep us back .
in the fall 2010 , a friend of guatemala paltavio sent the link to the tedtalk .
again , it showed him ja4 .
the two calls me .
and they said , &quot; let &apos;s present the head of our country ! &quot;
so we met in december of a hotels in december of a hotels .
i &apos;ve been trying to make sure how valuable cities are to like how much value they are than they cost .
and i &apos;ve used this chart to show how valuable it is on a place like new york . think that a space is worth thousands of dollars per square meter .
but it was a pretty abstract discussion on a place when there was a pause , octavio said , &quot; paul , maybe we could see the tedtalk . &quot;
so the tedtalk put in a very simple form that a charter city is a place , which is the beginning of uninhabited land , a green contract that puts the laws , the laws that are there , and the opportunity to make people decide , either under those rules or not .
that &apos;s why i was asked by the president of honduras , which meant that we need to make this project that it &apos;s important , and that this is the way to get our country forward .
i was asked to come to tegucigalpa , and once on the fourth and five january of january .
so i &apos;ve given another piece of facts with a facts that have a chart like this , which has tried to figure out that if you want to create a lot of value in a city , it must be a very large city .
this is a picture of the city of denass , and the sketch is the new airport that was built in denver .
this airport alone has a surface of 100 square kilometers .
so i &apos;ve tried to convince the honty of it if you want to build a new city , you have to start with an area at least 1,000 square kilometers .
these are more than 250 thousand tomorrow .
all shook up .
the faces of the audience were very serious and attention .
the head of the project came to the stage and said , &quot; professor romer , thank you very much for your talk , but maybe we could see the tedtalk .
i got it on my laptop . &quot;
so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk .
and i &apos;ve come to the point that a new city gives people new possibilities .
there would be the opportunity to live in a city that would be in honduras , rather than hundreds of miles away in the north .
and a new city also includes new possibilities for leaders .
the leaders of the government in honduras would depend on the aid countries , and they could benefit from their partner countries that they put in the laws of the charter , and they would support it , that everybody can trust that the charter is actually going to trust .
and the realization of president lobo was that the confidence of the treaty that i thought was about to get the foreign investors to get the foreign investors and build the city as much as the parties in honduras , who have been suffering for many years and mistrust .
we are in an area .
this picture is from this place .
it sums up a thousand square kilometers .
and shortly after that , at the 19th of january , they have voted for a change of the constitution to have a disagreement to have a disagreement for special development areas .
in a country that has just a high-level crisis behind congress , congress has been elected to a voice of four to a voice .
all the parties , all the fractions of society , supported this .
to become part of the constitution , it has to be approved twice by congress .
at the 17th of february , it was approved for the second time with 114 voice .
immediately after this election , between the 21st and the 24th of february , a delegation of about 30 partnerships in the world , who were most interested in the world who were most interested in building in the business of cities .
one place is south korea .
this is a picture of a large new city , new urban city that &apos;s built in southern korea -- great than the city .
everything that you can see on this picture was built within four years after it took four years to get the approval .
the other place that was very interested in the city was singapore .
it &apos;s already built two cities in china , and the third is in preparation .
so if you really think about it , it &apos;s where we are today .
you already have a building site , and you &apos;re looking at this area for the second city .
it &apos;s been working on a legal system , that expertise allows you to participate , and it &apos;s also working on an external legal system .
a country already has offered its top court to provide the supreme court , as a court for the disclosure of the state system .
also , urban designers and farmer are very interested .
they even bring funding to one .
one of the things that you already know has been used , there &apos;s a lot of mims .
there &apos;s a lot of businesses that would like to be in america , especially in a place with a free trade zone , and there are many people who would love to live there .
around the world , there are 700 million people who say they like to live on another place .
a million people are leaving latin america every year in the united states .
many of you are fathers who are forced to let back their families to work together , and sometimes it &apos;s single mothers who have to make enough money to eat food and clothes .
unfortunately , it &apos;s sometimes kids who are trying to find their parents who are trying to find them in some cases for a decade .
so what is it for an idea of thinking about it in hong as a completely new city ?
or even duzend of these cities to build or spread hundreds of around the world ?
so what is it for an idea to insist on that every family has a choice between several cities that are in competition for new residents ?
this is an idea that &apos;s worth spreading .
my friends from hong duras asked me to say thank you ted .
you know how many decisions you do in a typical day ?
you know how many decisions you meet in a typical week ?
i &apos;ve done a poll with over 2,000 americans recently , and the average number of decisions , the fear of fear , is a typical american one day .
also , recently a study was done with ceo in which they saw ceo for a week .
and these scientists have just documented the different topics that have these ceo , and how much time they spent decisions that relate to the issues .
and what they found is that an average ceo is working in the week with 139 tasks .
each of these themes , of course , was from many , many different decisions .
fifty percent of their decisions were made within nine minutes or less .
just for about 12 percent of their decisions , they needed an hour or more of their time .
think of your own decisions .
do you know how many decisions you meet in the nine minutes of category in one hour ?
how good do you think you &apos;re going to make decisions ?
today i want to talk about one of the biggest decision-making problems in our modern time , the decision-making problem .
i want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions .
now , when i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions and i want to know your answers .
if i ask you a question , raise , because i &apos;m blind , just the hand , if you want to burn some calories .
otherwise , i ask you , if i ask you a question , and your answer is yes , so my first question is : are you ready to hear about decision-making problems ?
thank you .
when i was a graduate student at stanford university , i went to this very exclusive lifestyle store , at least it was really exclusive .
it was a store called the draeger .
this business , it was almost like a joke .
they had 250 different kinds of mustard and vand and over 500 different kinds of fruit and vegetables and more than two dozen different kinds of water -- and that was a time when we actually drink water .
i loved to go to this business ; i have asked myself , well , how does it come from that you never buy anything ?
here &apos;s the olive oil gang .
they had about 75 different types of olive oil , including those who were embedded in boxes that came from thousands of years old .
so i decided one day to visit the branches , and i asked the ladder , &quot; does this model work that they really offer all of these possibilities ? &quot;
and he showed up the bus charges of tourists that came every day and usually had their cameras .
we decided to do an experiment and we chose marmelade for our experiment .
here &apos;s her mardge shop .
they had 348 different kinds of marmelade .
we set up a little sliver right on the entrance on the entrance .
we put six different tastes there , or 24 different directions of marmelade , and we looked at two things : first , i &apos;m going to be more people and marmelade trying to be more people and marmelade ?
they are more people when they were 24 , about 60 percent , when they were six , about 40 percent .
and after that , we looked at what people were doing more like a glass of mars .
now we saw the turning effect .
from the people who are at 24 , only three percent were actually buying a glass of mars .
the people who were standing as it were six , now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a glass of mars .
now , if you calculate it , people would buy six times a glass of mardge , who they had six to choice when they had 24 to choice .
now , to decide , not to buy a glass of mardge is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our taille -- but it turns out that the decision-making problem also affects us with very constructions decisions .
we don &apos;t decide to decide even when it comes to our own best interests .
so the theme of the day : savings saving .
i &apos;m going to describe to you now a study that i &apos;m talking about with gur huberman , ei jang , in which we did the decisions for retirement plans for retirement from almost one million americans in the entire united states .
and what we looked at was whether the number of causes were possible to be able to be able to have a pension plan , the 401 plan that influenced the likelihood of whether more for tomorrow is saved .
and what we found was , in fact , there was a correlation .
so in these plans , we had about 657 plans that gave people something between two to 59 different fund .
and what we found was that the more funds were offered that , in fact , participation was lower .
now , if you look at the extreme , the plans , the two fund , had a split in the 1960s -- still not as high as we want .
in the plans that wrote almost 60 fund , the subforce is now on about the sixth percent share .
now it turns out even if you were to get out of it , even if there were more possibilities , even then , it has negative consequences .
so , the people who decided to participate in themselves tend to make sure that the more possibilities available to you , the more they breed it and choose to choose .
the more possibilities they were available , the more they were more likely to put their money in pure shops .
none of these extreme decisions , belongs to the decisions that someone would recommend when their future financial well-being is important .
now , in the last 10 years , we &apos;ve seen three basic negative consequences in humans that provide more and more choices with themselves .
they push the decision -- push up , even if it &apos;s against your own best interest .
they &apos;re more likely to make decisions -- worse financial and worse medical decisions .
they &apos;re more likely to decide for things that make them less happy themselves , even if they make objective .
the main reason that we might enjoy it is that we may be able to look at this giant rainfall full of mayonaise , mustard , vand and mardge , but we can &apos;t pick the comparison and then actually choose something out of the fantastic supply .
so what i &apos;d like to suggest to you today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we &apos;ve tested in different ways and different research sites -- which you can just apply in your business .
first , narrow .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it &apos;s never been true than today , that less than that .
people are always concerned when i say , &quot; close . &quot;
they &apos;re always worried that they lose regalland .
but in fact , we &apos;re seeing it more and more and more that if you &apos;re willing to be able to narrow , and the unimportant possibilities are going to pay you , there &apos;s going to be the cost of sales , it will cost the cost , etc . , and there &apos;s improvement of decision-making .
as a proctor and gamble , the different head and florways of 26 to 15 , they experienced a rise of sales for 10 percent .
when the golden manufacturer sold her 10 at the worst , they found out that the gains around 87 percent -- a result of both the rise of oil and reducing cost .
you know , the average superhero today , it gives you 45,000 products .
a typical wal-mart gives you 100,000 products today .
but the nine-largest supermarket , the largest supermarket in the world today , is aldi , and they only offer 1,400 products -- a kind of tomato sauce .
now in the world of savings , i think one of the best examples that have recently arrived on the market , about how to best do the choices , was something that david laibm has made very strong , it &apos;s a program that &apos;s been offered at harvard .
every single harvard professor is now taking part of a life fund .
those who really want to make a choice , 20 fund , not 300 or more fund .
you know how people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to close it .
it &apos;s all important opportunities . &quot;
and the first thing i ask the employees is , &quot; tell me how to distinguish each other .
and if their employees can &apos;t keep them apart , they can &apos;t do their clients . &quot;
now before we started today , i had a conversation with gary .
and gary said that he would be willing to offer all of the people in this audience to the most beautiful road in the world .
here &apos;s a description of the road .
and i want to read you the same .
and now i &apos;m going to give you a couple of seconds to read you , and then i ask you to clap when you &apos;re ready to take it .
okay . everybody is willing to assume gary &apos;s offer .
are they all ?
well , let me show you a little bit more about it .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
well , who is ready for this journey .
i think maybe i &apos;ve heard more hands .
good .
in fact , that &apos;s what you look at , the first time you had more information than the second time , but i would think it was the second time you found it in the second time .
because the images made it real sense for them .
what brings me to the second technology that helps you deal with the problem of decision-making , it &apos;s the tangible idea .
it &apos;s because people , to understand the difference between possibilities , have to understand what consequences are associated with the individual possibilities , and these consequences have to be consistent and concrete .
why are people using average to 30 to 30 percent more if they use an ec-map or a credit card than in barcash ?
because it doesn &apos;t really feel money .
and it turns out that if you can do it , that something feels more specific , it &apos;s a very good tool , so you can make people save more .
so in a study that i made with shlomo benartzi and alessandro scholar , we &apos;ve made a study with the people who &apos;ve been working on ring -- and these people were all in a gathering that they &apos;ve done their participation for their pension plan .
and during this gathering , we &apos;ve just stopped this gathering as it used to be , just added a small thing .
the small thing we added was that we asked people to just think of all positive things that would happen in their lives if they save money .
in that we did this simple thing , there was a rise of participation around 20 percent , and there was a rise of the number of people who were willing to save or have an increase around four percent of the savings accounts .
the third technology : categories .
we can handle more categories than more choices .
here &apos;s for example , a study we &apos;ve done in a time track .
it turns out it &apos;s supermarkets on top of the top , and below in the northeast area , the number between 331 different kinds of magazines has gone up to 664 magazines .
but you know what ?
if i show you 600 magazines and put them up in 10 categories , or i &apos;ll show you 400 magazines , and that in 20 categories , you can believe that i gave you more choices and a better choice than i would have given you about 600 .
because the categories tell me how to keep them apart .
here are two different hunters .
one is called &quot; jazz &quot; and the other is called &quot; manchester . &quot;
if you think that the left display , the one on the left of jazz , is jazz , then you clap into your hands .
okay , there are some .
if you think that the one on the left is jazz and the ones on the right , you clap , please clap .
okay , some more .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
the one on the left is jazz and the on the right , but you know what ?
this is a highly useful label .
the categories have to say something , don &apos;t have to say the choice .
and this problem you often see when you look at the long list of all these fund .
who do you want to know ?
my fourth technology : premise for complexity .
it turns out we can actually handle more information than we think we need to simplify them .
we need to move the complexity slowly .
i &apos;ll show you an example of what i mean .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : the purchase of a car .
here &apos;s a clear car maker that gives you the opportunity to completely filter your car itself .
you have to make 62 different decisions to design your car completely .
now , these decisions are different in the number of choices that they provide every choice .
car colors , foreign color -- i have 56 possibilities .
motors -- four options .
what i &apos;m doing now is i change the order that make decisions .
half of the customers are going to be done by the many possibilities , 56 car colors , four gears .
the other half of the customers goes from the low possibilities , four motors , to the 56 car color , many possibilities .
what am i looking at ?
how do you care about it ?
if you &apos;re constantly using the standard choice in the decision , it means that you &apos;re going to be overchallenged , and i lose it .
what you &apos;re finding is that people who are going to go from the many to the smaller ones are always going over and over and over and over again .
we lose them .
go from the little choices to the many , then they stay .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of options .
the only thing i &apos;ve done is to change the order in which this information is being presented .
when i start with the simple start , i learn how to choose .
even even though the wings choose nothing about my preferences at the inside of the inner equipment , i still have to choose it .
it also puts me excited about the big product that i put together , and so i &apos;m willing to make me feel more motivated with it .
let me wrap up .
i &apos;ve told you about four techniques that are making the problem of decision-making station -- close -- you &apos;re going to get rid of the liquid alternatives ; you can make it real ; you can do it real ; categories -- we can do better with more categories ; it can be prepared for complexity .
each of these techniques that i &apos;m going to describe to you today is to help you manage the possibilities -- good for you , you can use them for yourself , good for the people you offer .
because i think the key to the best choice is that you &apos;re selective .
and the more we choose to pick , the better we will be able to practice the art of choice .
thank you .
hi . i &apos;m kevin allocca , trends-managers on youtube , and i &apos;m looking at youtube videos .
that &apos;s true .
today we want to talk about how video is infected , and then , why is that important ?
we all want to be stars -- famous ties , singers , aggression -- when i was young , that seemed infinitely difficult .
but web videos have allowed us to make all of our creative activities or all our creative activities in a part of the culture of our world .
every single one of you could be famous about the internet to next saturday .
but at youtube , more than 48 hours of video are uploaded every minute .
again , it will only become a tiny percentage of a percentage , and it will look like thousands and thousands of times .
so how does this work ?
three things : tastemaker , partty communities and the unexpected .
well , let &apos;s go .
oh my god . oh my god .
oh my god !
vodka !
whohhhh , wowwww !
last year , samvasquez did this video that he filmed in the yosemite national park .
in 2010 , it had been looked at 23 million times .
this chart shows what it looked like when the video was first popular for the first time .
in fact , kleiber didn &apos;t want to do viral video .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
because that &apos;s what you &apos;re doing when you &apos;re doing yosemite mountain .
he had a lot of natural videos .
and this video was actually already sent to january .
what &apos;s going on here ?
there was jimmy kimmel .
jimmy kimlett rayed the tweet that was so popular at the last time .
because tastemaker like jimmy kimmel put us new and interesting things and show you a big audience .
it &apos;s friday &apos; friday , friday . gotta go down on friday . everybody &apos;s flickr review to the zep- , realist , friday .
rs is one of the most popular videos of the year .
it &apos;s almost 200 million times this year .
this is how the graphics looked .
just like &quot; double rainbow , &quot; it seems to be out of nowhere .
what happened that day ?
well , it was friday , that &apos;s right .
if you want to know , these other peaks are also free .
but what about this day , this particular friday ?
well , tosh.0 foro , he started writing a lot of blogs about it .
michael j. nelson from the nih science theater was a first one who made a joke about twitter .
what &apos;s important is that a single person or group of tastemaker would take a point of view with a big audience shared and accelerated the process .
and then this community came from people who shared this great clack joke , and started to talk about it and playing around with it .
now there are 10,000 parodies of &quot; friday &quot; on youtube .
already in the first seven days , there was a parodie for every single week .
unlike the one of the 20th century entertainment of the 20th century , participation is our way to become part of this phenomenon -- either by spreading it or something new .
&quot; nyan knight &quot; is animation and music in endless loop .
that &apos;s it , very simple .
this year , it was almost 50 million times .
and if you think it &apos;s crazy , you should know that there &apos;s a three-hour version that &apos;s been looked at four million times .
even cats look at this video .
cats look at cats who look at this video .
it &apos;s important , the creativity that is in the internet culture of techies and geeks .
there were remixes .
somebody made an old-fashioned version of it .
and then it became international .
a whole new community made out of the ground that made it from a stupid joke to something that we could all participate on .
we don &apos;t just find pleasure in something we do .
who could have been able to look at this ?
who could have predicted &quot; double rainbow &quot; or rebecca black or &quot; nyan ceiling &quot; ?
how can they write their books in which kind of urgent is ?
in a world where every minute of two days , two days of video is being uploaded , it can only be unique and unexpected .
i &apos;m not really interested in it when a friend told me , i should look at this great video , about a guy who protested in new york to prison bikes .
i got a ticket because i &apos;m not on the bike road , but i often have disabilities that don &apos;t let you drive on the bike .
it was completely surprising and humorous , casey niests was funny idea and his argument five million times .
this approach is true for everything we do creative .
and that all leads to the one big question .
what does that mean ?
whohhh .
what does that mean ?
tastemaker , creative communities , completely unexpected , are the characteristics of a new kind of media and culture that has access to each access to the audience .
as i said , one of the biggest stars -- justin bieber -- did his beginning at youtube .
no one needs to give your ideas green .
and today , we &apos;re all feeling as owners of our pop culture .
and these are not the characteristics of the old media and they &apos;re not hitting the media of today , but they will determine the future of the future .
thank you .
how can i speak about the relationship between women over three generations , and the amazing strength of these interconnectedness in the lives of a four-year girl represented when she was over 30 years ago with her little sister , her mother and her grandmother &apos;s five days , and she &apos;s been in a small boat , her mother and her grandmother &apos;s life .
the story is not over .
it &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s put together .
i want to tell you about some of the puzzle bits .
imagine the first piece : a man who &apos;s burning his life .
he &apos;s a poet , a writer , a man whose whole life of the simple hope of unity and freedom of his home .
if you think about it in the communist of the communist in saigon , you have to realize that his life has been a single waste .
the words , as long as his friends , spotled now .
he moved back to silence .
he died , broken by the history .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i never met him personally .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
my grandmother never forgotten my life .
i had to make sure that it wasn &apos;t for free , and it was my job to learn that the story was really trying to destroy us , but we were overstanding .
the next puzzle piece shows how a boat runs in early morgenred red at sea .
my mother may was 18 when her father died -- in a arranged marriage , with two little girls .
for them , the life gave her a task : the escape of her family and a new life in australia .
it was completely isolated that they could fail .
after a four-year , and film drega glitt a boat on the lake , as fishing boat .
all the adults were aware of the risks .
the biggest fear they had pirates , rape and death .
like most adults on the boat , my mother was wearing a little toxic bottle .
in an capd , my sister and i would have , you know , drink yourself and my grandmother .
my first memories are from this boat -- the plug of the motor , the clapping of one wave on the wheel , the vast and empty horizon .
i don &apos;t remember the pirate that had a lot of times , but from the courage of the men of the men on our boat , or in the case of the motor , the six hours didn &apos;t want to start .
but i remember the lights of the oil platform before the malaysia coast , and the young man who collapsed and died , the end of the journey was too much for him , and the taste of the first apk , which gave me one of the men on the platform .
no apple ever looked like this again .
after three months in a refugee camp , we landed in melbourne .
and the next puzzle piece is about four women in three generations building together a new life .
we let us down in football scray , one of the class class class , which is the population of imformers .
in other words , in the middle of the middle class , their existence was completely unknown , there was no more sophisticated thinking in football .
the smells of the coacts came out of the rest of the world .
and the fat feves of english are between people who had one thing in common : they started new .
my mother worked on farms , then on a runband in a car factory , six days , twice .
they kind of managed to find the time to have english and education .
we were poor .
every dollar was shared , and it was put in more education for english and mathematics , no matter what we needed to do . mostly the new things were coming out of the second hand .
two beaches for school , every one to cover the holes in the other .
a uniform uniform to the buttons , because they had to live six years .
and there were the rare but painful chms of &quot; slick eye &quot; and there , and there &apos;s malpaintings : &quot; asians , go home . &quot;
after home ?
a little bit of a mess in me .
there was a meeting to reconciliation , and a quiet voice said , &quot; i &apos;m going to go out of the way . &quot;
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
my mother was exhausted every night , but we told each other from our day , and we heard the movement of our grandmother in the house .
my mother suffered from nightdreaming from the boat .
and it was my job to stay awake every night until their nightmares came to come up with me .
they opened up a computer business , then made a coscher , and they opened a business .
and the women came with their stories about men who didn &apos;t have the change , angry and inflexible , and sorted kids , caught between two worlds .
loans and sponsors were searched .
centers were built .
i lived in parallel worlds .
in one , i was the classic asian student , which was unmistasive demand .
in the other , i was in unsafe life , which was the tragic scars of violence , the drug of the drug and the isolated .
but so many received over the years .
and because of this help , i was reminded in my last year of judaism as a young australiist of the year .
and i went from a puzzle piece to the next catapulted , and it didn &apos;t fit together .
tan le , anonymous survivors of football scray , was now tan le , refugee and social activist who was invited to speak to places that they had never heard , and in homes , their existence could never have imagined .
i was not familiar with labels .
i didn &apos;t know how to bribe that .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i wanted to go back to the routine and the comfort of life of an unknown event -- a grandmother , a mother , and two daughters who were running out of their days as long as 20 years , by telling each other the stories of their day and robbed , we &apos;re still three .
i said my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
she reminded me that i was so old as she got to the boat when we got to the boat .
no was a way .
&quot; just do it , &quot; she said . &quot; and not what you &apos;re not . &quot;
so i talked about yugenes and training , and the marginalized of the marginalized and disapheld .
and the more open i was talking , the more i should tell .
i met people in all habitats , so many of them did what they loved in the limits of the possible .
and although i graduated , i realized that i couldn &apos;t find myself with a career in jura .
there had to be another puzzle piece .
and i realized at the same time that it &apos;s okay to be an outsider , a newcomtary , new picture -- and not just okay , but something you need to be grateful for , maybe a gift of the boat .
because there can be so easily to collapse in the horizontal of the horizontal , so easily means you accept the assumptions of the environment .
now i &apos;ve gone enough from my convenience to know that , yes , the world spreads apart , but not as you fear it .
possibilities that wouldn &apos;t have been allowed to be unreliable .
there was a energy , an unconsistent optimism , a strange blob of the humility and the wagcertain .
so i followed my gut feeling .
i collected a little team of people around me , which is not going to be &quot; an unfair challenge . &quot;
for a year we didn &apos;t have a cent .
at the end of a day , i made a huge pot soup that we shared .
we worked late to the night .
most of our ideas were crazy , but it was a couple of brilliant , and we managed to get the breakthrough .
i met the decision to pull in the united states .
after only one journey there .
my gut feeling again .
three months later i was moved and went to the adventure .
before i close the talk , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up at a time , in the confucianism , the social norm and the local advisers , the most important person .
life hasn &apos;t changed since centuries .
her father died shortly after her birth .
her mother took her alone .
at 17 , she became the second woman &apos;s second woman whose mother suggested her .
without support of your husband , she was worried for a very significant way to bring it back to trial , and she was in her own case , and a greater big thing than she won .
&quot; it &apos;s not true . &quot;
i just sat in a hotel room in sydney , when she died . 1,000 kilometers away in melbourne .
i looked through the dutside wall and i saw it on the other side .
i knew they had come to wake up .
my mother called me a few minutes after that .
a few days later , we went into a buddhist temple in football , and sat around their sarg .
we told her stories and insurance that we were still with her .
and at midnight , the monk and said he had to close the sarg .
my mother asked us to grab her hand .
she asked the monk , &quot; why is your hand so warm and the rest of it so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because you &apos;ve been holding it this morning , &quot; he said .
&quot; you didn &apos;t leave them . &quot;
if there &apos;s a band in our family , it &apos;s through the women .
you see who we were and how life shaped us , we can now see that the men that might have come into our lives .
the defeat would have been too simple .
now i &apos;d like to have my own kids , and i still think of the boat .
who would ever have a wish ?
yes , i &apos;m afraid of privilege , suffering , mastering .
can i give you a bug in your life , the courageous every wave of every wave , the unattached , steep tucker of the motor , which doesn &apos;t guarantee anything ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give that , and it could be safe , i would do it .
it &apos;s also the fourth mother today in the fourth or fifth row .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
is it photography at all ?
because , of course , this is a picture that you can &apos;t take with your camera .
yet , my interest in photography began when i got my first digital camera in the age of 15 years .
i combined it with my former preference for drawing , but it was a little different , because using the camera , the process was in planning .
and if you take a picture with a camera , the process ends when you squeeze on the board .
so for me , photography seemed to be more interested in being in the right place at the right time .
i believed everybody could .
so i wanted to create something else , something that starts when the engine is going to start .
photos like this : a building site along a much road road .
but it has an unexpected twist .
and nevertheless , a realistic level .
or photos like this -- dark and colorful , but all the common goal to keep a realistic level .
when i say reality , i mean photo-reality .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something you really can capture , but i want to let it look like they could have , on a photo .
photos where you have to think a brief moment to figure out the trick .
so it &apos;s more about catching an idea than really a moment .
but what is the trick that makes it look realistic ?
is it the details or the colors ?
is it about the light ?
what creates the illusion ?
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
but ultimately , it &apos;s about how we interpret the world , and how it can be made on a two-dimensional surface .
it &apos;s not about what is realistic , but what we think is realistic .
so i think the basics are very simple .
i see it as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces and put it together to create an alternative reality .
and let me show you a simple example .
we have three perfect physical objects that we can all identify in a three-dimensional world .
but in a certain way , you can create something that &apos;s still going to look three dimensions as if it could exist .
but at the same time we know that this is not possible .
so we overlists our brains , because our brain is very simple that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
and i see the same process in combining photographs .
it &apos;s really just about combining different realities .
so the things that look realistic , i think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t think about , the things around us in our daily lives .
but if we combine photographs , it &apos;s really important to think about it , because otherwise you just look wrong .
so i would say that there are three simple rules to follow a realistic outcome .
as you can see , it &apos;s not three special images .
but you can combine something special like this .
so the first rule is that combined photos should have the same perspective .
secondly , combined photographs should have the same way .
and these two pictures , these two sets of demands -- out of the same altitude , and the same type of light .
third , it &apos;s impossible to make it possible to make it possible , where the individual images start and end by connecting them to the sewage .
make it impossible to say how the photo was actually put together .
so by putting color , contrast and helise to the edges of the individual images , it &apos;s intertwined with a fish , like the field of land , shatted colors and disorders , and we have the limits between the different images and it can look like a single picture , even though a picture can be literally hundreds of levels .
here &apos;s another example .
you might think that this is just a landscape of land , and the bottom was manipulated .
but this picture is really completely put together , from photos of different places .
i personally feel that it &apos;s easier to create a place than finding a place because you don &apos;t have to have compromise with the ideas in your head .
but it requires a lot of planning .
and when i had this idea in winter , i knew that i needed several months to find the different places for the puzzle of the puzzle .
for example , the fish had been taken on an anglum .
the bank is from another place .
the underwater part comes from a brick .
and yes , i &apos;ve even lifted the house up on the island of red to make it look like sweden .
so to get a realistic outcome , it goes from me on planning .
i always start with an acting , an idea .
and then it &apos;s about the combination of the different images .
and here is a very well-planned piece .
and if you do good images , the outcome can be pretty beautiful , and also quite realistic .
so there are all the tools there , and the only thing that we can get is our imagination .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to talk to you about why so many electronic health projects failed .
and i think the most important point is that we stopped talking with our patients .
and one of the things that we introduced on the bike boud university was a major audience .
it &apos;s not particularly scientific -- it &apos;s a cup of coffee or tea and asks the patients , families , relatives , &quot; how are we ? &quot;
how can we help you ? &quot;
and we think we want to think that this is one of the main problems why everyone -- maybe most of the electronic health projects failed : because we stopped listening .
this is my wlan-waage . a very simple thing .
she &apos;s got a button on it .
and every morning i get involved .
and yes , i have a job as you might recognize .
i gave my job to 95 kilos .
it works very simple : every time i go to the waage , you send my data to google health .
and they &apos;re going to go from my general doctor , so he can see where my weight problem is , not only in the moment that i need kardicological assistance or something , but also with a look at the past .
but there &apos;s something else .
maybe you &apos;re familiar with that , i &apos;ve got over 4,000 biases who on twitter .
so every morning i put on my wlan-waage and people talk to me before i &apos;m sitting in the car , &quot; to lunch , just a little salad today , lucien . &quot;
but this is the net , what can happen , because this is the group driven , group forced , to help patients , because that could be used against obesity , or it could take patients to smoke .
but it could also be used to get people out of their chairs , and get them to play some kind of play , to control their health better .
next week , it &apos;s coming on the market .
there &apos;s going to be this little blood printed device that you put on an iphone or something like that .
and it will allow people to measure their blood pressure , send it to their doctor , for example , to share with others , for something more than 100 dollars .
at that point , the patients come into play . they can &apos;t just take control again , captain on their own ship , but also , in the face of the challenges , the challenges of health care , and so on .
make ways that are easy to use and start embracing them with this , patients in the team .
and you can do that through these techniques , but also by crowdsourcing .
and one of the things we &apos;ve done , i want to share with you a short video .
we all have navigation systems in our cars .
maybe even in our phones .
we know exactly where all the plums there are around maastrids .
we know one more where all the gas stations are .
and sure , we can find fast food chains .
but where would the next ab , to help this patient ?
we were asking , and nobody knew it .
no one knew where to find the next life rescue in this moment .
so , what did we do ? we did crowdsource in the netherlands .
we set up a website and asked a human mass , &quot; if you see an ab , please share with us where he &apos;s closed , &quot; because sometimes it &apos;s closed during business times , of course .
and over 10,000 aeds have been pushed in the netherlands .
the next step was to find the apps for it .
and we designed an ipad app .
we developed an app for layar , extended reality to find these aeds .
and if you &apos;re in a city like maastricht and someone collapses , you can use your iphone , and within the next couple of weeks , your microcamera can save your micromobile phone to find the life .
and today we don &apos;t want to just do this as aed4u , as the product is called , but as aed4us .
and we want to bring this to a global level .
and we &apos;re asking our colleagues all over the world , from other universities , so to help us understand how to behave , to try and crowdsource these aeds around the world .
and if you &apos;re in vacation and someone collapses , it &apos;s your own relatives or somebody else , you can find an ab .
the other thing , we want to ask , is that companies are helping us all over the world to embrace these aeds .
these could be funny services , or engineers , for example , just to make sure that the organized ab is still in his place .
please help us and try and make it not just a difference , but to take the hand .
thank you .
today i &apos;m going to report from unexpected discoveries .
i work in the solar tech industry .
and my little startup wants us to make a transition environment by ...
... it takes the crowdprofit .
here &apos;s a quick video of what we do .
oh . a moment .
it may take away until it &apos;s charged .
now -- we can just skip this -- i &apos;m going to just jump over the video instead .
no .
that &apos;s not ...
okay .
solar technology is ...
oh , my time is over ?
okay . thank you .
so a few years ago , i started a program to get the stars in technology and design to take a year off and work in an environment that is pretty much everything they actually hate , we &apos;ve made them work in the government .
the program is called &quot; code for america , &quot; and it &apos;s a little bit like the peace scorps for computer geeks .
we choose several fellows every year , and we &apos;re going to let them work with urban services .
instead of sending them into the third world , we send them in rathenas .
and they developed great apps , worked with urban employees .
but what you really do is to show what today is possible with technology .
so they meet al .
al is a hydrant in the city of boston .
here it looks like he &apos;s looking for a date , but what he really is looking for is somebody who &apos;s running it out , because he &apos;s going to know it &apos;s not very good in the branding of the snow when it &apos;s covered by a meter of snow .
how did he get to look for this particular kind of aid ?
we had a team of fellows last year in boston , the code for america .
they were there in february , and it &apos;s got a lot of time in february .
and they realized that the city never drips out these hydrant hydrant .
but a particular fellow , a man named erik schwarelde ober , he noticed another thing , and that was that the residents were getting out of the civil walks .
so he did what everybody would do good , he wrote an app .
it &apos;s a nice little app where you can adopt a hydrant .
you &apos;re going to pick up to him , if it &apos;s fine .
if you do that , you can give him a name , and he called the first al .
if you don &apos;t do that , somebody can take it away .
so there &apos;s a nice little game dynamic .
this is a modest little app .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of the 21 apps that have written the fellows last year .
but she does something that no other government technology does .
they &apos;re spreading down .
there &apos;s this guy in the i.t. department of honolulu , which has seen that he could use this app , not for snow , but , so citizens , the tsunami of the tsunami .
it &apos;s very important that these arteries actually work , but people steal the batteries .
so he got the citizens to check them .
and then seattle decided to use the app to get the citizens to get the clogged sullys .
and chicago has just introduced it to get people out of the buinters when it hits .
we now know nine cities that are planning to use this app .
and it has a fuel , organic , of course .
if you know something about government technology , you know it &apos;s usually not going to happen .
the nature of software takes a few years .
we had a team that worked last year on a project in boston for three and a half months .
it was about a method with the parents to find out what the right public schools are for their children .
we later told that if it was going to go over the normal channels , it took over two years , and it would have cost over two million dollars .
and that &apos;s nothing yet .
there &apos;s a project right now in california , which cost the taxpayer so far two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this on every level of government .
so an app that &apos;s written in a few days , and then it spreads by seluss , is a kind of a shot of the wheel on the institution of the government .
it shows how the government could work better -- no more like a private company , how many people think they should .
and not even like a tech company , but rather like the internet itself .
and that means free access , which means open and productive .
and that &apos;s important .
but more important about this app is that it represents a new generation , which is the problem of the government -- not as the problem of sales , but as a problem of collective trade .
and this is a very good news , because it turns out we &apos;re very good at the collective act of digital technology .
now there &apos;s a big community of people who make the tools that we need to put things effectively together .
it &apos;s not just &quot; code for america , &quot; there are hundreds of people in the country who write and write government apps , every day in their own communities .
they didn &apos;t give up the government .
they &apos;re horribly frustrated with her , but they don &apos;t complain about it .
and these people know something we &apos;ve lost from the eyes .
and that &apos;s when you all forget your feelings about politics and the snake in working office and all the other things that we really forget about is government , in the core , of tim o &apos;venlly , &quot; what we can do in common that we can &apos;t do alone . &quot;
now a lot of people have given up the government .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , please , i want you to think about it because things change .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is in change .
and because the government ultimately gets their power from us -- remember , &quot; we the people ? &quot; -- how we think about how this change is happening .
i didn &apos;t know very much about government when i started this program .
and how many people , i thought it was mainly about choosing people in office .
now , after two years , i &apos;ve come to the conclusion that it &apos;s especially living in community communities .
this is the call center for service and information .
you usually come out when you were in your city 311 .
if you have to have the chance to work in your urban call center , like our fellow scott silverman as part of the program -- in fact , they &apos;re all going to see that people who call the government because of many different problems , they &apos;re going to see that people are calling the government for many different problems .
so scott gets this anchor .
he says &quot; thylacines &quot; in the official database .
and he doesn &apos;t really have an idea . he starts with the animal spill .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , can you just open the doors in your house and play very loud music and see if the livestock of the animals ? &quot;
and that worked . round for scott .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the thylacine rats .
boston wasn &apos;t just a call center .
it has an app , a web and hand app , called citizens link .
we didn &apos;t write this app .
this is very clever people in the office of the new urban stimuli in boston .
one day -- that &apos;s an actual report -- came up with this : &quot; thylacines in my trash . can &apos;t say if she &apos;s dead .
how do i get them away ? &quot;
but what happens to &quot; citizens link &quot; is different .
scott underheld from human beings .
but &quot; citizens connect &quot; is all public , so everybody can see it .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
and the next post that we got was , &quot; i went over there , found the landfill behind the house .
thylacines ? yes . alive ? yap .
turned the trash to the site . went home .
good night , sweet thylacines . &quot;
pretty simple .
this is great . here &apos;s the digital the physical .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how to crowdsource the government .
but it &apos;s also a great example of the government as a platform .
and i don &apos;t mean necessarily a technical definition of the platform .
i &apos;m more likely to talk about a platform for people to help themselves and help others .
a citizen helped another citizen , but the government played a central role here .
they connected these two people .
and you could have associated them with government performance , if these were needed , but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative to government services .
if a neighbor helps the other , we use our communities .
let &apos;s call the animal spill , it costs a lot of money .
one of the most important things is that we have to think that government is not the same as politics .
and most people understand it , but they think this is the input of the other .
that our contribution to the system is choosing .
how often have we chosen a political leader -- and sometimes we &apos;ve used a lot of energy to choose a new political leader -- and then we &apos;re looking back and we expect the government to reject our values and not change much ?
this is because the government is like a continued ocean and politics are the top 15th .
and what &apos;s below is what we call forestry .
and we use this word with such contempt .
but it &apos;s this contempt that we have , and we pay to be something that works against us , something else , and then we made ourselves .
people seem to think politics is sexy .
if we want this institution to work for us , we need to make bureaucracy sexy .
because that &apos;s where the real government works .
we have to rely on the government &apos;s machine .
so the productors did it .
have you seen these guys ?
it &apos;s a group of concern written a very detailed 325 page report , which is an answer to the sec memo about the law reform .
this is not political being active , which is bureaucratic .
now , for those of us who have given up the government , it &apos;s time that we think about the world that we want our children to leave .
you have to think of the enormous challenges that you have to imagine .
do we really believe that we have to achieve what we need to achieve without improving the institution in the name of all of us ?
a government is absolutely necessary , but it needs to be more efficient .
the good news is that technology makes it possible , the function of the government in a way that can actually achieve something by empowering society .
and there &apos;s a generation that &apos;s grown up with the internet , and that knows that it &apos;s not so hard to do things together , you have to build the systems .
now the average age of our fellows is 28 , so i &apos;m , unfortunately , almost a generation older than most of you .
this is a generation that grew up to see their voice of granted .
they &apos;re not fighting this struggle that we all fight , so who &apos;s to speak ; they &apos;re all allowed to talk .
you can think of it , on every channel at every channel , and they do .
so if you &apos;re confronted with the problem of government , don &apos;t take care of using your voices .
they use their hands .
they use their hands to write applications that improve the government of the government .
and these apps allow us to use our hands to improve our communities .
it could be free to lift a fire hydrant , uncuring it , turn it into a sales with a thylacine .
and sure , we would have these hydrant fire all the time , and a lot of people do that .
but these apps are like little digital memories that we &apos;re not only consumers , and we &apos;re not only consumers of government who pay taxes and profits .
we are more than that , we &apos;re citizens .
and we &apos;re not going to improve government until we improve the citizenship .
so the question i have for you all here : if it &apos;s about the big , important things that we have to do together , all together , will we be a lot of voices , or will we be a lot of hands ?
thank you .
usually , my role is to explain the people how wonderful the new technologies , which are coming up , and i thought , because i &apos;m under friends , i would tell you what i really think , and i &apos;m trying to understand what &apos;s going on , and i &apos;ll try and see what &apos;s going on , and i &apos;ll try and understand what &apos;s going on .
i &apos;m going to start just showing you a single , boring slide .
... you could just show the slide .
this is a slide that i have chosen from my folder .
i &apos;m not about the details of the slide , but rather about the general form .
this slide shows data from a analysis of the value of risc processors with the performance of a local area networks .
the interesting thing here is that this slide , as manch others , which we often meet in our field , are kind of a semi-logarithmic curve .
in other words , every step here is a potency in the scale scale .
and this is a novelty that we need to use this guy at a semi-logarithmic curves in technology .
something very strange happens here .
this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
so , if you could make the light again .
another thing , because i &apos;m going to draw something on the paper right here .
now , why do we draw graphs in the technology on semi-logarithmic curves ?
the reason for that is , if i draw it on a normal curve , where , say , this is the years , so the time of a kind , and this is a separation of the technology that i want to describe with a graph , then the graph is silly .
that &apos;s what you see .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
now , if i want to record a different technology , let &apos;s say a transportation technology , then that would be very unreasonable at the semi-logarithmic scale , in the form of a flat line .
but if something like this happens , it changes quality of resilience .
so , if the transportation technology would continue as fast as the microprocess technology would continue , then we could get back into a taxi , and we would be in tokyo .
but that &apos;s not so quick .
this has never been before in the history of technology development , these kinds of recursical growth , which is increasing exponentially , every few years .
so the question i want to ask you now is , if you look at this exponential curves , you don &apos;t see it forever .
it &apos;s not possible that everything is evolving forever and long as it is now .
there are two ways .
either it &apos;s going to be a classic curve like this , until something completely new comes from , or it &apos;s going to happen here .
that &apos;s about it .
well , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think something like this is going to happen .
it &apos;s really that , then it means we &apos;re in the middle of a transition right now .
we &apos;re here on this line , in a transition from the past world to a new kind of world .
so the question i want to ask you , and i also think of myself , is how is this new world going to be ?
what is this new state that makes the world slow ?
because the transition seems very , very confusing to being in the middle of it .
when i was a kid , the future was somewhere in 2000 and people often talked about what would happen in the year 2000 .
now we have a conference here where people talk about the future , and you realize that the future is still in 2000 .
and then we don &apos;t .
so in other words , the future of every year since i &apos;m on the world since i &apos;m on this world .
i think the reason for that is we realize that anything is happening .
the transition . we can feel it all .
and we know that right now doesn &apos;t make any sense of trying to look at 30 or 50 years in the future , because everything is going to be so different from what we do now not make sense .
i want to talk about what that might be , this transition in which we are right now .
to do this , i &apos;m going to talk about some other things that really don &apos;t have to do with technology or computers .
because i think to really understand this , we have to step back and look at the thing on a long time scale .
and that &apos;s what i want to look at at the time scale of the earth .
i think the whole picture makes sense , if you split it in some billion steps .
so let &apos;s go back , and that &apos;s 2.5 billion years , and the earth was a big , sophisticated plate with lots of swedish chemicals .
now , if you look at the way these chemicals were organized , there &apos;s a pretty good picture about how they put it .
i also think there are theories that start to understand how everything has started with rna , but i &apos;m going to tell you a simplified story about what is , at that time , small oil droples , which have different kinds of reception for chemicals .
some of these oil droctors were a special combination of chemicals that allowed them to integrate other chemicals from outside and to grow .
all of those were , they started to divide .
these little oil panels were in the sense the most primitive cell form .
but these oil droctors were not about living in the sense of life today , because every single one of them was just a small , random recipe of chemicals .
and every time it divided , you have the very same kinds of chemicals in it .
so every drip was a little different .
in fact , the droctors grew , which had the genetic composition , faster than others and integrated more and more chemicals from outside and shared faster .
so these tenties to survive longer and they increased into scale in scale .
so this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but more interesting , it &apos;s learned when these dropds learned a trick about abstraction .
in any way that we don &apos;t even understand what we don &apos;t quite understand , this drip is the ability to write information .
they &apos;ve learned to store the recipe of the cell as information , and in a particular chemical form that we call dna .
in other words , with other words , they found a way to find a way that allowed them to write out what they insisted , so that this information could be stored and copied .
and the amazing thing about this is that this kind of information to store over the time of 2.5 billion years in which they were born .
in fact , the recipe is for us , which is our genes , from exactly the same code and the same .
and every creature is using exactly the same letter and the same code .
we &apos;re as far as we can write only for the purpose , ourselves in this code .
and i &apos;ve got 100 micrograms here of a white pulse that i &apos;m trying to keep in the airports of security .
in there , what i &apos;ve done is i &apos;ve taken this code -- the code is made of normal letters , which we use for symbolic -- and i &apos;ve written my business card on a piece of dna and i have 10 ^ 22 times .
so if somebody wants a hundred million copies of my business card , i have enough for everybody in this room and even for everyone in this world , and it &apos;s right here .
if i was in fact , i would have been an ego , i would have written it on a virus and put it in the room .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
the dewriting of dna was an interesting step .
and that caused these cells -- that made them happy for another billion years .
but then another , very interesting step , where things were completely different from the things that were completely different , and that cells started to communicate and exchange information from cells .
i don &apos;t know if you knew that , but bacteria can actually replace their dna .
it &apos;s also why it &apos;s growing to antibiotics .
some bacteria have figured out how to hold penicillin and put this information together with other bacteria in the dna and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate with penicillin .
now this communication allowed the reasons of communities that were in a certain way in the same boat ; they were synertic .
so they either survived together , or they went together , and that meant that if a community was successful , all the individuals of the community were repeated more often and by evolution .
now this is where these communities are so close to where these communities are so close to the fact that they decided to write the recipe for the whole community in a post chain .
and the next interesting phase took about another billion years .
at this point , we have multi-cellular communities , communities of many shifts , which together is a single organism .
in fact , we &apos;re such a multi-fishing community .
we have a lot of cells that are not prepared anymore .
your skin cells are useless without heart cells , muscle cells , brain cells and so on .
so these communities started moving together , so that the level , on which evolution was happening , wasn &apos;t longer the individual cell , but the cell community that we call organism .
the next step is now within these communities .
the cell communities began to abstract information again .
and they developed special structures which made no other way to process information within the organism .
and these are the neural structures .
so the neurons are the information system that has built these cell communities .
they started to train specialists within the community , special structures , which were responsible for learning , understanding information .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
this gave them an evolutionary advantage .
because at this point , there &apos;s an individual -- learning now within the lifespan of a single organism , rather than about this evolutionary period .
so , for example , an organism could learn to eat a certain fruint , because they made bad and made him sick , the last time he was eating it .
now , this could happen within the lifespan of a single organism , whereas hundreds of thousands of years ago , they had to have learned because this information had to be learned by the individuals , which died because of these frudents , because of these kinds of assets .
so the nervous process has the evolutionary process with this particular information structure because evolution could now be within an individual .
it could take place within a time framework .
what happened after that is that the individual organisms found a way to communicate with each other .
as an example , the most sophisticated version of this communication is the human language .
it &apos;s an amazing invention when you think about it .
i have a very complicated , fuzzy and confusion idea in my head .
i &apos;m sitting here and i basically give some reason to create the hope of the hope of making a kind of weird idea in your head that has a certain kind of similarity with my original idea .
so we take something very complicated , turning it into notes , a sequence of sound , and making something very complicated in the head of others .
so this allows us to work again as a unified organism .
and what we actually did , we , the humanity , is we started abstracting .
we &apos;re going through the same stages , which are multicellable organisms -- the abstraction of our methods , how we hold data , present , process .
the invention of language for example was a little step in that direction .
telephone , computers , video records , cd roms and so on are all our specialized mechanisms that we built in our community to have this information hand .
and it connects us all together to something that &apos;s much bigger , and it &apos;s also able to move faster than we &apos;ve been .
so today , evolution can happen in time from microseconds .
you &apos;ve also seen a little evolutionary example where he showed a bit evolution in &quot; convolitarian &quot; program , right before your eyes .
so we &apos;ve regraded the timeline again .
the first steps of history , which i told you , is a billion years per piece .
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , put some hundred million years .
then the night steps , like language and so forth , is less than a million years .
and these next steps , like electronics , seem to take a few decades .
the process feeding itself from itself , and it &apos;s going to be , i think , car catalytic is the word for this -- if something improves .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
and i think that &apos;s what we see here in this exploding curve .
we see the process that feeds itself from itself .
i live a living from building computers and i know that i &apos;m going to use the mechanism that i use to build computers , not using the progress recently in computer technology .
my current activity is to design objects with such a high complexity that it &apos;s impossible for me to design these in traditional sense .
i don &apos;t know what every single transistor is doing in the commitment machine .
it has billions of those .
what i &apos;m going to do instead , and what the designers of thinking machines are doing is we think of a certain level of abstract levels , that the machine and the machine makes something that goes far beyond us .
and it makes it partially with methods that we don &apos;t even understand right now .
one way , which is particularly interesting , and what i &apos;ve often used recently is the evolution itself .
and we install an evolutionary process in the machine , which is happening in the microwave area .
to give you an example , in the most extreme cases , we can create a program which is developed from random ininstructions .
we say , &quot; computers , please have a hundred million randomly chosen sequences of inadvantages .
now , please take all of these randomly elected inadvantages , all the programs run out , and eventually choose those who are the closest . &quot;
so in other words , i define first what i want .
let &apos;s say , i want to take numbers , which would be a simple example , which i &apos;ve been using for that .
so find programs which can roll on the best numbers .
and of course , the chance of accident is very small , it &apos;s very small in random numbers , so you probably don &apos;t get the instructions to do this .
but one of those with something lucky is two numbers in the right order .
now i say , &quot; computers , now take those 10 percent of the sequences , which came to my closest .
there &apos;s going to be the rest of it , the rest .
now reprodusting all the remaining ones that the numbers have best sorted .
and with a method of combined , analog to reproduction . &quot;
take two programs , and they &apos;re producing kids through the exchange of their subral , and the kids that have the characteristics of the subroutines from the two programs .
so i have a new generation of programs that came through combinations of programs , which have come up with a little bit closer than others .
say , &quot; please repeat this process . &quot;
take a job again .
you might run some mutations .
and try this again with another generation .
all these generations only require few milliseconds .
and so i can go through evolution about millions of years in the computer , or in more complex cases , a few hours .
finally , i get programs that can perfect numbers perfectly .
in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i could ever write from hand .
when i look at these programs , i can &apos;t tell you how they work .
i tried to understand them .
it &apos;s verring and strange programs .
but they do the job .
i know and i &apos;m sure they do the job , because they come from a range of hundreds of thousands of thousands of programs that have done the job .
because your life depended on whether you did the job right .
i sat in a 747 together with marvin minsky , and he &apos;s coming up with a map and says , &quot; oh look . look at that .
there is , &quot; this airplane consists of hundreds of thousands of dollars working together to make their flight safer . &quot; does it make you more reliable ? &quot;
we know that a development process isn &apos;t optimal when it becomes too complicated .
so we start to rely on computers , for a process that &apos;s very different from the classical community .
he allows us to do things with a much higher complexity than the normal methods allow us to produce .
and yet , we don &apos;t even understand the possibilities .
so , we &apos;re sort of covering the technology .
we &apos;re using these programs now to make the computers much faster , so we can do these processes even faster .
so it creates feedback feedback .
it will be faster and faster , and i think that &apos;s why it seems so confusing .
because all these new technologies of today are feeding themselves .
we pick up .
we &apos;re at a point , the analog is at the time , when it comes to cell organisms .
so we &apos;re the amoil and we can &apos;t really do what the hell is actually creating here .
we &apos;re in the middle of that point .
but i really think something is going on .
i think it &apos;s very high from telling us that we are the end product of evolution .
and i think we all are part of the creation of what &apos;s next .
well , lunch is before and i think i &apos;m going to listen to now , before i get selected .
my story starts right here in rajasthan , about two years ago .
i was under the star sky in the desert with suatoms singers mubbtiar ali .
we talked about that nothing has changed since the age of ancient indian era , &quot; mahabharata . &quot;
if we wanted to travel indians then we went into a car and we went across the sky .
now we do that with airplanes .
at the time , when the big indian warrior had prince junla durst , he took a bow , shot in the floor and water .
now we &apos;re doing this with the merals and machines .
we came to the conclusion that magic and magic was replaced by machines .
that really made me sad .
i got some fear of technology .
i was afraid that i could lose the ability to help the sunset without camera and no tweet to my friends .
i found that technology should make magic and not kill .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little silver calculator .
this piece 50 years old , the most magical thing for me .
it became a gulf access to a world full of pirates and contaminated ships in my imagination .
and i thought it was like our fancy clocks and the cameras of it .
they kept us inspired by this .
and so i was in the world of technology to see how i could use it to make magic rather than killing .
i started to illustrate books with 16 .
when i saw the ipad , i looked at it as a device to the storytelling of the world .
it can know how we hold it .
it can know where we are .
it &apos;s taking pictures and text together , and animation , sounds and touch .
the storytelling always took more sense .
but what do we do with it ?
i &apos;m just going to khoya , an interactive ipad app .
here &apos;s &quot; take your finger on every light . &quot;
and so -- here &apos;s &quot; this box belongs ... &quot; i write my name .
and i &apos;m going to be a character in the book .
and again , a letter goes down to me -- and the ipad knows through gps where i live -- that &apos;s right to me .
the child in me really is really excited .
i talked a lot about magic .
i don &apos;t mean a magician and kity , but the magic of childhood , those ideas that we all had as children .
fireflies in a jar i found always very exciting .
so you have to let the ipad break out here and get out of fireflies .
and the light path through the rest of the book .
another idea that fascinated me as a child is that a whole galaxy can stick in a single murmel .
and that &apos;s why every book is going to be a little murmel , and every world i &apos;m going to take to the magic device in the device .
and this opens up a map .
fantasy books always had maps , but these maps were static .
and this map is growing and lighting and serves to the rest of the book .
it also turns out to other places of the book .
i &apos;m going in here .
it &apos;s also important for me to make something that is an extreme , but also very recently .
this is the apsaras .
we all heard of feen and nybers , but how many people outside india know their indian colleagues , the apsaras ?
the poor apsaras were caught over thousands of years in indras kambers , in an old cucumber book .
and we bring them back , in a contemporary history for children .
a story that spreads with new issues , like the environmental crisis .
the environmental crisis , a big problem of the last 10 years , is that kids are sitting in their rooms , in their computers , without getting out .
but now , with mobile technology , we can take our kids into the natural world with their technology .
in an interaction of the book , you &apos;re sent out to a search , and you have to go out and get the camera images of natural objects .
when i was a child , i had reports of story , stones , kiesas and shells .
somehow , the kids don &apos;t do anymore .
this is what childhood ritual will bring back . you have to go out to make a picture of a flower and tag .
in another chapter , you have to have a piece of paper photographic and mark .
so you actually create a digital collection of photographs that you can then put online .
a kid in london shows the picture of a fusion and says , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve seen a fusion . &quot;
a child in india says , &quot; i &apos;ve seen a monkey today . &quot;
this creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photographs that you actually recorded .
there &apos;s a variety of ways of connecting the world and technology .
in the next book , we plan an interaction where we use the video of the ipads and see through augmented reality a animation that appears on a plant in front of the house .
at a point , the screen filled with leaves .
you have to do the sound of the winds , you have to blow away and read the rest of the book .
we all move to a world where the science of technology is getting closer and in the magic and technology .
we use the energy of the sun .
we bring our kids closer and closer to the natural world , and the magic , fun and the love of our childhood through the simple medium of a story .
thank you .
this is really an extraordinary honor for me .
i spend most of my time with people in research , prison or death cells .
i spend most of my time with social weakest in social development and places where there are very much hopeful .
to be here at ted , to see and listen , and to listen to it , that has given me a lot of strength .
in the short time here , i realized , ted has a identity .
you can say things here , the world &apos;s influence .
and sometimes , if something comes about ted , it gets a meaning and strength that otherwise doesn &apos;t have .
i say that because i think identity is very important .
we &apos;ve seen some amazing presentations .
i think we &apos;ve learned that the words of a textbook have meaning , but the words of a dedicated teaching is particularly meaningful .
as a physician , you can do good . but as a doctor , you can do more .
and that &apos;s why i want to talk about the power of identity .
i didn &apos;t learn that in my work as a lawyer .
i learned this from my grandmother .
i became big in a family , a traditional african-american household , who was dominated by a matriarchin , and that matriarch was my grandmother .
she was a tamp , strong woman , she had influence .
she had the last word in every family .
she was also the starting point of many constructions in our family .
she was the daughter of slave .
their parents were born in the 1840s in virginia as a slaves .
she was born in 1880 , and the experience of slavery is very strong .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also loving .
when i met her as a little boy , she came to me and she bought me .
they pushed me so hard that i could barely breathe . they let me go .
one or two hours later , if i met her , she came to me and said , &quot; bryan , do you feel my hug ? &quot;
and if i said , &quot; no , &quot; she would write me again . when i said , &quot; yes , &quot; she said to me .
it was something that was made that you wanted to be close to her .
the only problem was that they had 10 children .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
sometimes if i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to get their attention .
my cousins walked around everywhere .
i remember , i have to have been eight or nine , that i woke up one morning and went into living rooms . all my cousins walked around .
my grandmother was sitting at the end of the room , and i went .
first of all , i thought that was a game .
i looked at it and smiles , but she was very serious .
that was so 15 or 20 minutes . then she stood up and came to me . she took me hand and said , &quot; come , bryan . you and i , we need to talk . &quot;
i remember when it was yesterday .
i &apos;ll never forget it .
she took me out to go outside and said , &quot; bryan , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you have to promise that you don &apos;t tell it . &quot;
i said , &quot; promised , grandma . &quot;
she said , &quot; honor word ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
she sat down and looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to see that i watched you . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do anything you want to do . &quot;
i will never forget that .
then she said , &quot; you just have to promise me three things , bryan . &quot;
i said , &quot; ok , grandma . &quot;
she said , &quot; first of all , i think you &apos;ll always love your mom . &quot;
she said , &quot; your mom is my baby , and you have to say you &apos;re going to take care of you . &quot;
i got my mother , so i said , &quot; yes , grandma , i &apos;ll do that . &quot;
and then she said , &quot; next , i &apos;m going to tell you that you &apos;re always going to do the right thing . &quot; even though it &apos;s hard to do the right thing . &quot;
i thought , &quot; yes , grandma . i promise it . &quot;
finally , she said , &quot; the last thing you have to promise me is that you will never drink alcohol . &quot;
well , i was nine years old , and i said , &quot; yes , grandma . i promise it . &quot;
i grew up on the land in the old south , rural south and i have a brother who is older and a year older sister .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day , my brother came home and brought this sixp beer to my sister and i went to the forest and went to the forest .
we were just silly there as well .
then he took a drink beer and offered my sister &apos;s sister , and she took it , and then she offered me one .
i said , &quot; no , no , no . ok . just make it . i don &apos;t want a beer . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; well , let &apos;s do it . now we &apos;re doing this , you &apos;re going to do everything we do .
i had what , your sister had what . go , drink k . &quot;
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want . just power . just do it . &quot;
my brother approached me .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s wrong with you ? well , what . &quot;
and then he looked at me , and he said , &quot; oh no , you don &apos;t always make you crazy because of the conversation with grandma ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; grandma tells everybody that they &apos;re special . &quot;
i was devastated .
i &apos;m going to show you something .
i should not do that .
this may be publicly transmitted .
i &apos;m 52 years old , and i &apos;m standing that i &apos;ve never drink a drop of alcohol .
i &apos;m not saying that because i think it &apos;s tuhy . i say that because identity means power .
if we create the right way of identity , we can tell people about things that they don &apos;t believe first .
we can get them to do things that they thought they couldn &apos;t .
of course , my grandmother would say all their grandchildren , they &apos;re something special .
my grandfather was in prison during the prison .
my uncle died of alcocide diseases .
and she believed that this was the themes that we should take care of .
i tried to say something about our justice system .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
in 1972 , 300,000 people in delhi and prison .
today , it &apos;s 2.3 million .
the united states today has the highest incarceration of the world .
seven million people rely on currency or unconsistent crimes .
i think mass incarcerators fundamentally changed our world .
in socially weak and black parts of the population , despair and hopeful , because of that changes .
one of three male black , between 18 and 30 , is in prison , in prison , on currency , or unconditional criminal mandation .
in urban communities all over the country -- from los angeles across philadelphia , baltimore to washington -- are 50 to 60 percent of all black young men either in prison , in prison , or unconditional protections .
but our system will not only be shaped by asking the questions that have to do with birds , it &apos;s going to be through poverty .
we have a business system in this country that you &apos;re treated much better if you &apos;re rich and guilty than poor and innocent .
wealth , not denial , it affects the outcome .
however , we seem to be very content with it .
a politics of fear and anger has convinced us that these problems are not our problems .
we lost the contact .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
there are some very interesting developments .
my home state , of course , draws the election right when they &apos;re convicted .
here today , in alabama , 34 percent of the male black population is permanently losing their vote .
we predict that in 10 years the rate of the world &apos;s recognition is going to be as high as front of the vote of voting law .
silence is oafthetic .
i offer kids .
many of my clients are very young .
the united states of america is the only country in the world , the thirty year-old children in prison .
in this country in our country , there are children living for children without related crimes .
we &apos;ve already run a lot of ways .
the only country in the world .
i put people in death cells .
the death penalty question is an interesting question .
we believe because you &apos;ve taught us that the real question is : does a human being deserve to die for a national crime ?
this is a very sensitive question .
but you can also think differently about how we see our identity .
the other way is not : does anybody deserve for a crime , but do we deserve to kill ?
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
the death penalty is defined by error .
in nine people who we executed , we come from one that we have to find for innocent , which was released and released from death cell .
an amazing error rate . one of nine innocent people .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
we would never let anybody fly with an airplane if for nine planes , who cut off , one down .
but somehow we create it from this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden .
it &apos;s not our struggle .
i &apos;m talking a lot about these questions .
i talk about race and the question whether we have the right to kill .
and it &apos;s exciting because i put my students in american history . i talk about slavery .
i talk about terrorism , the time against the end of the reconstruction , until the beginning of the second world war .
we don &apos;t really know very much about it .
but for the african-american americans in this country , it was a time of terror .
in many areas , people had to be frightened of lynchmobs .
or before bombs .
it was the fear of terror that shaped your life .
these older people now come to me and say , &quot; mr. , stevenson , you &apos;re talking , you &apos;re talking . you tell people that you should stop saying that we have to stop to do it for the first time in our nation &apos;s history . &quot;
they say , &quot; no -- tell people that we grew up with it . &quot;
and after terrorism , of course , the rasals came in and decades of rivastic motivated and apartheid .
and yet , in our country , there is a dynamic -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
and so we don &apos;t really understand what the meaning of our actions are in the historical context .
we &apos;re constantly hitting each other .
we &apos;re always creating new tension and conflicts .
it &apos;s hard to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to approach the process of truth and reconciliation .
in south africa , people have understood that the rasals are not to overcome the willingness to truth and reconciliation .
even after the genocide in rwanda , there was this willingness , but not in this country .
i kept some talks in germany about death death .
it was fascinating because one of the scientists stood after my talk and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply disturbing , you &apos;re talking to you . &quot;
he said , &quot; in germany , there &apos;s no death penalty .
and of course , you can never give it more in germany . &quot;
it was all silent , and then a woman said , &quot; with our history , it &apos;s impossible that we &apos;re ever going to talk to the systematic of people .
it would be made of us consciously to set up and target people . &quot;
i thought about it .
as it would feel to live in a world where german state people set up , especially if there were a lot of jewish jews .
it would be intolerable .
it would be clear .
and yet , here in this country , in the states of the old south , we put people in -- here &apos;s the risk to death being convicted of , 11 times higher , when the victim is white , when it &apos;s black . 22 times higher , if it &apos;s black . 22 times higher , if it &apos;s black .
and yet there &apos;s this mental oppontion .
i think our identity is threatened .
if we don &apos;t deal with it , with these difficult topics , the positive and wonderful things are also affected .
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity .
we love entertainment .
but ultimately , these realities are declining by suffering , abuse , descending , enstructional .
i think it seems important to unite both .
because we ultimately talk about that we need more hope , more engagement , more commitment to a complex world .
for me , the time to get to think and talk about the poor who never will be at ted .
but think about a way that is embedded in our own lives .
we all have to believe in the last thing that we can &apos;t see .
we do that . so we &apos;re so rational , so we estimate very intellect .
innovation , creativity , and development are not just coming from our heads .
they come from ideas that are driven by believing in our hearts .
it &apos;s this headhive that i think drives us , not just being open to all the bright and exciting things , but for the dark and problematic .
vaclav haquez , the great chea politician once said .
as we fought in eastern europe , we wanted to do all kinds of things , but what we needed most was hope , a spiritual orientation , the willingness , sometimes to be hopeful places , and to be witness . &quot;
this mental orientation is the core of what i believe also have to be committed to the ted communities .
there are no distinction for technology and design that allows us to be completely human , as long as we don &apos;t have eyes and ears for poverty , enstructional and injustice .
i want to warn you . this kind of identity challenges a lot more of us than if we don &apos;t learn about it .
she &apos;s deeply touching her .
as a young lawyer , i met the great privilege , pink parks .
coming back to montgomery was coming back to montgomery , where they had two of their oldest friends traamp these older women , john never carr , who had organized the montgomery-bus -- and virginia durr , dr. king .
so these women , they were just meeting themselves .
and then , up to a woman carr , and i said , &quot; bryan , lady parks comes into the city . we want to talk .
do you want to come and listen ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yes , really like it . &quot;
she said , &quot; and what are you going to do when you &apos;re here ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
and i went over and listened to just .
it was always so inspiring . it was so inspiring .
and one day i was sitting there listening to these women , and after a couple of hours , lady parks turned to me to tell us , &quot; well , bryan , don &apos;t tell me what the &quot; initiative &quot; is right .
what do you try to achieve ? &quot;
i started with my usual talk .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to go against injustice .
wr wants to help people who were convicted of innocent .
we want to anticipate and discrimination in the criminal justice system .
we want to subsidize life without related crimes for children .
we want to do something about death businesses .
we want to lower the number of heads .
we want to create mass incarcerations . &quot;
i gave my usual talk , and then she looked at me and she said , &quot; whoa . mhmm . mhmm . &quot;
she said , &quot; it &apos;s going to make you very , very tired . &quot;
and then lady carr , in front of me , put a finger on my face and said , &quot; and therefore you have to be very , very brave . &quot;
and so i think the ted community should be tager .
we need to think of ways . we have to challenge this challenges : these problems , this suffering .
because ultimately , our humanity depends on our humanity .
i learned very simple things in my work .
i learned a few very simple things .
that we &apos;re all more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
i think that &apos;s true for every person on the planet .
if you &apos;re lying , it &apos;s not just a liar .
if somebody takes something that doesn &apos;t hear it , it &apos;s not just a burb .
even who kills someone is not just a killer .
and because that is , there is a fundamental human dignity to respect the law .
i also think in many parts of this country , and certainly in many parts of the earth , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i don &apos;t think so .
i think in many places the opposite of poverty is justice .
and finally , i believe that , although it &apos;s so dramatic , so beautiful and inspiring , and so on , we &apos;re not going to be measured at the end of our technology , not the things that we develop , not in our intellect and understood .
finally , a society is not measured by how they treated their rich and powerful and privileged , but about how they deal with the poor , the incarceration .
because in this context , we first start to understand the amazing things that make us feel .
sometimes i lose the balance . a story to end .
sometimes i squeeze too much .
i &apos;m getting tired of how we all .
sometimes these ideas play our thinking in a very important way .
i owe these kids to become very hard attention .
i go to the study prison and i go to a client who may be 13 or 14 years old , and the adult should stand in front of court .
then i ask myself , how could this happen ?
how can a judge turn somebody into something that he &apos;s not ?
the judge is looking at him as adults , but i see a child .
one night , i stayed too long and thought , oh my goodness , if a judge can turn us into something else , it must have magic forces .
right , bryan , the judge has magic forces .
you should also give you the wish .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t think more right , i started working on an anmiton .
i had a 14-year-old , poor black young boy .
and i started to deal with this , and the headline said , &quot; anr. , my arms , 14-year-old black men like a privileged , white , 75-year-old top manager . &quot;
in my business , i explained that misbehavior of the state of the state and the police as well as an error .
there was a crazy line about it that in this country there is nothing more wrong in this country .
the next morning , i woke up , and i didn &apos;t know if i had just dreamed of this crazy script or actually written it .
and i didn &apos;t just write it , but i sent it to the court .
a few months went on and i just forgotten everything .
but finally , i decided , my god , i have to go to the court and have this crazy case .
i went into the car , and i was really overwhelmed .
so i went to the court .
and i thought that &apos;s going to be so painful , so painful .
finally , i went out of my car and i went to the court .
when i got up to the court , there was an elderly , black man , the janitors in the court .
when he saw me , he came to me and he said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
he came to me and huiled me .
then he got to the ear .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud to you . &quot;
and i have to say it gave me power .
it touched something very deeply in me , identity , the ability of every single one to contribute to a community of hope .
well , i entered the court office .
once the judge looked at me .
he said , &quot; mr. stevenson , did you have this crazy resurrection ? &quot;
i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and then we started discussing .
more people came in , just because they were mad .
that i had written these crazy things .
police officers came in and commander states and office workers .
in hand , the middle department was full of people who were angry , that we talked about skin color , about poverty , about inequality .
from my eye angle , i saw the janitors and go off .
he always looked through the window and he could hear the whole tohuwbean .
he went and down .
finally , this older black man came out with a very quiet face in the court hall and sat right behind me , almost on the defense bank .
10 minutes later , the judge quit a break .
during the pause , a police officer came in , that the janitors was in the court room .
this deputy ran over the older black .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do in the court ? &quot;
the older black man stood up . he saw the deputy , then he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;ve come , to say this young man , lose the goal . don &apos;t give up . &quot; don &apos;t give up . &quot;
i &apos;ve come to ted because i believe that many of you have understood that the moral pendulcs of the universe is far out of the universe , but that it &apos;s the justice .
that as humans , we &apos;re not completely evolved as long as we don &apos;t care about human rights and basic values .
that all of our survival with the survival is connected to each other .
that we have to connect our visions of technology and design , of entertainment and creativity with humanity , compassion and justice .
and most of all , i want to leave you with those who see that as well , just say , lose the goal , don &apos;t give up .
they have seen an obvious wish in this audience , and they &apos;ve heard to help them and do something .
what can we do ?
bryan stevenson : well , there &apos;s opportunity everywhere .
if you live in california , there &apos;s a national election in this spring where it &apos;s about actually doing a effort to do something from the money that otherwise flows into politics of punishment .
here , in california , you &apos;ll have a billion dollars in the next five years for death , a billion dollars .
and yet , 46 percent of all the kidnics didn &apos;t end with one .
56 percent of all rape cases don &apos;t come from trial .
here &apos;s the opportunity to do something .
this session is going to propose to invest the money in more security force and security .
i think there are opportunity everywhere .
during the last three decades , the criminals are major in america .
this fact is being put in a context of increased numbers .
what would you say to someone who believes this ?
well , in fact , the number of violence has not changed very much .
most of the mass incarceration in this country didn &apos;t really find the class of nonviolent crime .
it was the misguided cross train against drugs .
so the dramatic high numbers are coming in prison .
we &apos;ve invaded the rhetoric of the punishment .
now , we &apos;ve got &quot; three &quot; laws , the people for all the time , for a bicycle theft , for the theft of good good , rather than that you force them to give back the victims .
i think we need to do more to help people who have become the victims of care , not less .
and i think our current punishment scores don &apos;t help anybody .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
bryan , you really have a string of gravity here .
they &apos;re an inspiring personality .
thank you for being at ted . thank you very much .
bin death is a higher risk of death .
famine in somalia . three : pepper spray the police .
three : malig-like cartelle . speakers 5 : dangerous upright ships .
six : social decline . seven : 65 .
eight : tsunami . 9 : cyber attacks .
various speakers : drug war . mass destruction . tornado .
recession . vivid . doomsday . egypt . syria .
crisis . death . disaster .
oh my god .
so these are just some of the clips i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- but also the last six days , or the last six years .
the fact is that the media prefer to show us negative issues because our minds give attention to these topics .
and there &apos;s a very good reason for this .
every second , our senses will catch much more information than our brain can ever process .
and because we &apos;re not more important than our survival , the first stop for all the information is part of our temporal lobe , the amygdala .
so the amygdala is our early warning system , our risk detector .
it turns out , and it passes through the entire information in search for every threat of danger in our environment .
so if we see the news , we prefer to look for negative news .
and the old adage , &quot; if it &apos;s blood , the demand goes very true .
now , with all our digital devices that we have seven days a week , 24 hours a day of all these negative messages , it &apos;s not a miracle that we are pessimistic .
it &apos;s not a miracle that everybody thinks that the world is always worse .
but maybe this is not the case .
maybe the reality is .
maybe the amount of progress that we have in the last century has made a series of forces that are so strong that it &apos;s possible to create us in the next three decades , a world of overcoming .
well , i &apos;m not saying that we don &apos;t have big problems -- climate crisis , animals die , water and energy problems -- we have already .
and as humans , we &apos;re much better at looking at problems in a very long way , but eventually they &apos;re starting to overcome .
let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve done in the last century , so we can anticipate the development .
in the last hundred years , the average life expectancy has doubled more than doubled to inflation in the world &apos;s last 100 years .
child mortality has a tenth of child mortality .
it turns out that diet , electricity and communication costs , and communication costs and communication costs .
steve pinker showed us that we live in a very peaceful time in human history right now .
and according to charles kenny is the literacy rate in the last 130 years of an 80 percent .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and many people forget this .
and we increase our expectations constantly .
we actually redefined poverty .
remember that a large percentage of americans living under the poverty line , access to electricity , water , toilets , refrigerators , tv phones , mobile phones and cars .
the richest capitalists of the last century , the empires of the earth , could have never been dreamed of these luxury goods .
the basis of a lot of these technologies , and they grow excertain .
my good friend ray kurzweil has shown us that every tool that is going to become information technology , on the curve of moore &apos;s law , does great jumps , and price performance is doubling all 12 to 24 months .
that &apos;s why the mobile phone costs in her pocket about a million times less and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer from the &apos; 70s .
now look at this curve .
this is moore &apos;s law last hundred years .
notice two things on this curve .
first of all , how smooth it is -- in good times , war or peace , recession , depression , depression and highly conconcture .
this is the result of fast computers building faster computers .
it &apos;s slowed down for none of our big problems .
also , despite their logarithmic damage on the left , she goes up .
so the growth rate itself is accelerating .
and on this curve , on the back of moore &apos;s law , we find a series of extraordinary technologies that are available to all of us .
&quot; cloud computing , &quot; something that my friends call the car desk , &quot; calculus , &quot; sensors and networks , robots that allow you to democratize the personal production on our planet , synthetic biology and artificial intelligence .
how many of you have seen the victory of ibm supercomputer watson at risk ?
and that was grandios .
i used to go through the newspapers and look for the best headlines i could find .
i love this : &quot; watson forces human enemy . &quot;
&quot; risk is not a simple game . &quot;
it &apos;s about understanding the nuances of language .
imagine that this artificial intelligence gives each owner to each owner of a mobile phone .
four years ago , ray kurzweil and i was here at ted a new university called &quot; singularity university . &quot;
we bring to our students all these technologies with special focus on how these can be used to solve the great challenges of humanity .
and every year we ask the students to create products , products and services that can live in a decade of positive life from billions of people .
think about it that a group of students today can influence the lives of billions of people .
30 years ago , this would have been ridiculous .
today we can have dozens of companies that have done exactly this .
when i think about creating abundance , i don &apos;t mean a life full of luxury for everyone on this planet ; it &apos;s about creating a life full of possibilities .
it &apos;s about creating scarce goods .
because scarcity is conwords , and technology is a resource force .
here &apos;s an example .
this is the story of napoleon iii in the middle of the 18th century .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
he invited the king of siam to dinner .
napoleon &apos;s soldiers got sil-bribe , napoleon himself .
but the king of siam got aluminum bribe .
aluminum was at that time the most valuable metal on the planet , valuable than gold and plaine .
this is why the dome of the amsterdam sound monuments made out of aluminum .
even though aluminum is taking to eight percent of the earth &apos;s mass , it &apos;s not as rone metal .
it &apos;s going to be connected by oxygen and astrolabates .
but then the technology of electrolysis was developed and made organs so cheap that we use it with our way mentality .
then let &apos;s put this analogy into the future .
we think today about energy scarcity .
ladies and gentlemen , we live on a planet of 17,000-times more energy than we consume every year .
16 terawatts of energy praw all 88 minutes on earth &apos;s surface .
it &apos;s not about scarcity , the problem is accessible .
and there &apos;s good news .
this year , for the first time , the cost of solar power in india has to reduce 50 percent of the value electricity in india -- 8,8 rupees compared to 17 rupees .
the cost of solar dropped in the last year is 50 percent .
last month , this was published with a study that shows that until the end of this decade of the entire decade of the united states of the united states , the solar cost of energy is going to cost 6 cents in the national average .
and if we have energy overlooked , we will have water abundance .
let &apos;s talk about water wars .
do you remember , carl sagan , the nih space vehicle in 1990 , when it moved by saturn , turned back to earth ?
he took a famous photograph . how did it say ?
&quot; a hunter blue dot . &quot;
because we live on a water planet .
we live on a planet that &apos;s covered in 70 percent with water .
yes , it &apos;s 97.5 percent salds , two percent are covered , and we fight around 0.5 percent of the water on the planet , but there &apos;s hope .
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
it &apos;s new nanotechnology on the road , nano-materials .
and from a conversation today with dean kaman , one of the innovators of doing it , i want to share it with you -- he gave me the permission -- he gave me permission -- his technogy , the &quot; slingshot &quot; is called &quot; slingshot , &quot; and that &apos;s the size of a refrigerator .
it can generate thousands of gallons of clean drinking water per day -- whether salt , polluted water , latrine -- and all that for less than two cents per liter .
the president of coca-cola has just collapsed to start a large project with a hundred units in developing countries .
and if everything goes well , and i &apos;m very confident , then coca-cola becomes global in 206 countries around the planet .
this is technology support innovation that we have today .
and we &apos;ve seen this in mobile phones .
my goodness , we &apos;re soon reaching the 70 percent rate of mobile phones in developing countries to the end of 2013 .
just consider that a mamao warrior with a mobile phone in the middle of kenya has a better mobile communication than president reagan 25 years ago .
and if you look at your smartphone on google , you have more access to knowledge and information clinton than president clinton 15 years ago .
they live in a world that has information and communication in how no one could ever predict .
and it &apos;s even better , the things that you and i spend tens of thousands of dollars -- gps , hd video and photograph , libraries of books and music to medical diagnosis -- are now going to be transformative and cheaper in your cell phone .
and the best thing about it is perhaps what &apos;s expected us to do health .
in the last month , i had pleasure with the quality studios foundation called &quot; $ 10 million qums of the x prize . &quot;
we challenge teams all over the world , all these technologies with each other in a cell phone , that you can talk to the device , because it &apos;s with ai , you can test it in your hands or your blood values .
and to win , the device needs to be a better diagnostic than a team highly skilled .
imagine this device in the middle of a developing country , where there is no doctors , but 25 percent of the disease burden and 1.3 percent of the staff of health care .
if this device is sequenced a pure or dna virus , which is not known , it calls the health budget and prevents a pandemic in front of it .
but now the biggest force that will lead us to a world of oversea .
i call it &quot; the coming billion . &quot;
the white lines are population population .
we &apos;ve just crossed the seven-billion-token brand .
and just by the way , the largest decline against a population explosion is a better education and nutrition in the world .
in 2010 , we had been connected to two billion people online .
until 2020 , we &apos;re going to predict about two billion internet users .
three billion new minds that we &apos;ve never heard about before will be the global communication .
what do these people need ?
what are you going to consume ? what are you going to want ?
and instead of business , i see one of the largest economic benefits of history .
these people represent multiple trillion dollars that will flow into the global economy .
and they will be trained by using the tricoders healthier , and they &apos;re getting trained to be trained by the khan academy , and by using the opportunity to use 3d printers , and so much more productive than ever before .
so what can three billion growing , healthy , educated , productive members of the human community us ?
what about a sentence of new , never heard heard before .
how would it be that the oppressed , wherever you are , give a voice to pay attention and create change , for the first time ?
what will these three billion people bring ?
how about sticks that we can &apos;t even predict ?
one of the things that i learned by x prize is that small teams that are motivated by passion and focus , can create extraordinary things , things that could only create large companies and governments in the past .
i want to finish with a story that really excites me .
there &apos;s a program that some might already know .
it &apos;s a game called the foldit .
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
and it &apos;s a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids to explore how the protein is evolving .
according to his behavior , we can predict the structure and function .
and this is very important in medical research .
so far , this was a problem for supercomputer .
and this game was played by university programs and so on .
and it &apos;s now hundreds of thousands of people playing the game online .
and it turns out that today the human pattern recognition is better the proteins than the best supercomputer .
and when those individuals came and looked at who is the best flute in the world , it wasn &apos;t a pc professor , no caltech student , it was somebody from england , manchester , a woman who was working as a assistant in the day and at night the best flute of the world .
ladies and gentlemen , what gives me enormous trust in our future is the fact that we have more power than individuals in order to imagine the great challenges of our planet .
we have access to an exponential technology .
we have the passion of a diy innovators .
we have the capital of techno-philies .
and we have three billion new minds that we can work with online to master the new challenges , and to do what &apos;s needed .
we expect some extraordinary decades .
thank you .
i think we need to do something about a changing piece of medical culture .
and i think it starts with a medical institution , and i &apos;m .
and maybe i &apos;ve been in business for a long time as that i can give up a piece of my own fake to make this happen .
but before i get to the actual theme of my talk , let &apos;s start with a little baseball .
hey , why not ?
we are the seasonal and move to the world championship .
we all love baseball , right ?
baseball is full of great statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
&quot; moneyball &quot; comes out and turns about statistics and to use this great baseball team .
i &apos;m going to relate to a statistic that i hope most of you have heard before .
it &apos;s the average performance of the bat .
we talk about a 300 , when a bat beat 300 .
what that means is that the player suggests three of 10 beats .
it &apos;s called the ball of the ball , and it &apos;s going to come up , it &apos;s not being caught , and who &apos;s trying to throw the ball up to the first base , it didn &apos;t get done in time and it was safe .
three out of 10 .
do you know how to call a 300th patch of time ?
well , really good , maybe a benign star .
you know how to call a 400th ?
this is someone who is safe in the rest of 10 .
legendary -- like ted williams legendary -- the last major league of baseball players during a regular season .
let &apos;s go back to my world of medicine , in which i feel a lot of good , or maybe a little less likely for me to talk to you about .
so suppose you have a blind rule , and you become a maateur , which is the average performance 400 in terms of blind consent .
it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
imagine life in a specific neighborhood , and you have a beloved people with clogged heart disease , and you overlined your homework to a cardiologist , whose average performance is about 200 .
but , you know what ?
it &apos;s a lot better this year . it &apos;s on the rise .
and she &apos;s beating a 257 .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
what do you think like the average performance for a cardiologist or a nurse or an orthopedist , should be an emergency soldier ?
1,000 , very good .
the truth is that no one in the entire medicine knows what a good surgeon or a doctor should be , or a doctor or a rescue stent .
what we do , though , is that every single one of them , including me , is being locked in the world with being perfect .
never make a mistake , but no one does the details of how it should be done .
and that &apos;s the message i took in medical school .
i was a retired scholar .
in high school , i said , &quot; brian goldman would learn for a bloody test . &quot;
and so it was .
and i learned in my little halls in the sisters , of course , of a general hospital , unfar from here .
i learned everything .
in my anatomic classes , i learned the origins of the origins , every branch of a every branch of the artery , which leads away from the aorta , curs and ordinary differential diagnostics .
i even knew the differential diagnosis to classify renale tubuves .
and the whole time i collected more and more knowledge .
and i was good , i sat down with cum laude .
and i left the medical study with the impression that i knew if i memorized everything , and i knew , or at least as much as possible , as close as possible to do that i was independent against mistakes .
and it worked for a while until i met a woman &apos;s printer .
i applied to a hospital hospital in toronto here in toronto as a woman &apos;s printer in the emergency department of the hospital .
at this point i was the kardicological layer in kardiological service .
and it was my assignment when the emergency nurse cardiological advice was looking at the emergency patient .
and feedback to my local doctor .
i studied a woman &apos;s printer and she was in respiratory .
and when i listened to her , she made a climb sounds .
and when i heard her chest with the stethoskes , i could hear a pencil of the sound on both sides that said that they had suffered under congestic heart failure .
this is a state in which the heart fails to pump , rather than pump all the blood on , a part of the blood in the lung , and that is , you know , the short-term power came out .
and that was not hard to diagnosis .
i hired them and made me the treatment .
i gave her an exclusive . i gave her medicine to take the pressure from heart .
i gave her the medicine that we call diuretics , water pill , so that they put the liquid .
and over a year and a half to two hours , she started to feel better .
i felt really good .
and i made my first mistake ; i sent them home .
i actually did two mistakes .
i sent them home without talking with my head doctor .
i didn &apos;t take them up , and i did what i should have had , which would have been a call in my upper doctor to deal with him , so that he had a chance to make a whole picture .
and he knew it , he would be able to control additional information .
maybe i did it with good reason .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be a doctor .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so capable of taking responsibility that i was so capable of being able to touch my patients without having to contact it .
my second mistake was worse .
that &apos;s what i sent them home , i was quiet voice in me , trying to say , &quot; goldman , no good idea . don &apos;t do that . &quot;
in fact , it really lacked me so much of self-security that i asked the nurse , which was taking care of woman &apos;s printer , &quot; do you think it &apos;s okay when you go home ? &quot;
and the nurse was thinking about it and said , &quot; well , i think it &apos;s going to go well . &quot;
i remember as being yesterday .
so i was going to go back and have a medical cart , and i would come home and get them home .
and i went back to work .
the rest day i had this nagging feeling in my stomach .
but i kept working .
and at the end of the day , i grabbed my things , the hospital and i went to the parking lot to drive the car home when i did something that i didn &apos;t do .
i went home to my way home .
and there was another nurse saying , not the sister who had seen computers after the woman , but to me another three words , and i fear those three words that i know most of the time .
other doctors are afraid , but the emergency medicine is particularly , because we &apos;re just seeing the patients like this .
the three words : remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patient you sent home ? &quot;
asked the nurse .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said , &quot; she said in this particular clay .
so she was back .
she was back , and she was dying .
about an hour after she got home after i sent her home , she collapsed and the family called 911 . the dining assistant brought them back to the emergency ward with a blood pressure of 50 , which is a dangerous shock .
she wasn &apos;t breathing and was a blue angelker .
the emergency staff took all the strands .
they gave her blood pressure .
they closed them on the hills .
i was shocked to go into the inner store .
and i was living through these rolleraster because they came to the effectiveness of the intensive care and i hoped she would recover .
and after two , three days realized that she was never going to panic again .
she had no treatable brain damage .
their family gathered .
and over the course of the next eight or nine days , they gave themselves a picture .
at the modern day , they get them -- woman &apos;s printer , a woman , a mother and grandmother .
you say that you will never forget the names of those who die .
and that was the first time i learned this myself .
and the next couple of weeks , i made a suggestion , and i learned for the first time myself , the unhealthy shame that exists in our medical culture -- i felt myself , isolated , not the kind of normal shame you can feel because you can &apos;t talk to the colleagues .
you all know the healthy shame , if you give a secret of the best friend prize , even though this one is on a dissection , and then you get the best friend , and the best friend leads to it , and i &apos;m going to leave you with a bad discussion , if you will never make a mistake again .
if you ever know , you know , if you don &apos;t make your mistakes again .
this is the kind of educational shame .
the unhealthy way i &apos;m talking about is the one in the inner world .
it &apos;s the one who says that it &apos;s not what you did , it &apos;s bad , it &apos;s you yourself .
and that was what i felt .
and it wasn &apos;t because of my high doctor , he was very dear .
he spoke to the family , and i &apos;m sure he was glass , and he was sure that i was not going to be sued .
but i kept asking myself questions .
why did i not ask the top doctor ? why did i sent them home ?
and then in my worst moments : how could i make such a dumb mistake ?
why did i go to medicine ?
slowly , it made it safe .
i started feeling better .
and then one day a day , there was a hole in the clouds and the sun broke up and i could probably feel better again .
and i was with me that if i doubled my efforts to the perfection , and never again a mistake , that the voice could fail .
and she did .
and i kept working .
and then it happened again .
two years later , i had service in the emergency hospital in a committed hospital north of toronto , and i gave a 25 year-old old man with ricks .
it was a lot , and i in a hurry .
he always showed up here .
i looked at the ragging and it was a little pink .
and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him on .
and even when he went out of the door , he showed up .
two days later , i came to my next emergency service , and my chedyess asked me to a conversation in her office .
and she said three words : do you remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patients with the rails ? &quot;
it turned out he &apos;s a tour of infection .
he had potentially a life-dangerous disease named eglottitis .
you can google , but it &apos;s not an infection of the wheel , but the upper respiratory lanes and causes the respiratory pathways .
and fortunately , he didn &apos;t die .
he got intravenous anti-botica and ered a few days later .
and i went back through the same torcet of shame and self-doubt , and i felt liberated and went to work until again and again and again .
in an emergency layer , i &apos;ve seen two times a blind law .
there &apos;s a lot of this , especially if you think that you &apos;re working in a hospital that &apos;s only 14 patients per night .
in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home , and there was probably no man in her treatment .
i thought he had a kidney stones .
i launched the x-rays of the kidney . when it wasn &apos;t a fund , my colleague at the revision of the patient was stuck in the lower right sector and called the operateers .
the other one had strong diarrhea .
i set up to redicate him to receish and asked my colleagues too .
and he did , and he was in the lower bottom of the right sector , called the crime .
in both cases , operized and it was okay .
both of those cases of mine , ask me .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst mistake only happened in the first five years , which is a lot of my colleagues , but total nonsense .
some of my favorites happened in the last five years .
alone , compassion and no support .
here &apos;s the problem : if i don &apos;t close with my mistakes and talk about them , if i know what really happened to me , how can i share it with my colleagues ?
how can i teach you my mistakes so that they don &apos;t do the same thing ?
if i was in a room -- like now , i don &apos;t know what you think about me .
when did you hear the last time of someone who was talking about failures about failures ?
oh yeah , you go to a cocktail party and you may hear about any other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody talking about your own mistakes .
if i was in a room full of colleagues and asked to ask her immediate support , and to tell them what i just told you , i would probably not achieve the end of the second story before it really would give you a joke and forget the rest .
and in fact , if i knew or my colleagues , an orthopedide in my hospital would have taken the wrong leg , you know , i would have trouble looking at him in the eyes .
that &apos;s the system that we live in .
it &apos;s a totally denial of mistakes .
it &apos;s a system in which there are two basic positions -- those who make mistakes and those who don &apos;t do . those who don &apos;t do , those who deal with bad outcomes and the good results .
it &apos;s almost an ideological reaction like antibodies , which are a human attack .
and there &apos;s the idea that if we do the people who are doing mistakes from medicine , we have a safe system .
but there are two problems .
in my about 20 years of public consciousness and journalism , i made a personal medical study about medical mistakes and false treatments to make all kinds of things i could do for the toronto of my first article that i wrote for the toronto star to my show white , black art .
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely unchanged .
we work in a system where every day one of 10 medications is either a false or wrong thing , in the hospital infections , and more and more rich , or dead .
in this state , about 24,000 canans die of total mistakes .
in the united states , the institute of medicine is the number of 100,000 .
both of these are strong subvals because we don &apos;t look at the problem as well as we should .
and it &apos;s the crux .
in a hospital system where medical knowledge is doubling every two to three years , we can &apos;t keep staying .
sleep scarcity is ubiquitous .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we have a cognitive error , so we can take a perfect disease for a patient with breast pain .
then i take the same patient with breast pain , and i &apos;m going to cut it down and give it a light , and give it a slightly more alcohozed breath and suddenly the history of contempt .
i don &apos;t take the same thing .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things .
and my patients are not cars ; they don &apos;t always tell me their symptoms in the same way .
all of these are misavoidable .
so if you take the system like i &apos;ve been taught , it &apos;s how i &apos;ve been taught , and all the faults of health practice is at the end of nowhere .
and you know the glue of people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
in my show &quot; white comedian , black art , &quot; i have the habit of saying , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; i would say to everybody from the rescue assistant to the chefari of kardicologists to say , &quot; this is my worst mistake , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah ,
and then their puils expand , they &apos;re caught in front of the head , and then look down and swallow , and start telling their stories .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
they want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t do the same mistake i made . &quot;
what you need is a environment that you provide in the position of it .
what you need is a new medical culture .
and it starts with a doctor .
the new redefining physician is a human , knows about his humanity , accepted it , is not proud of making mistakes , but it puts everything out of them , so it can be passed on .
they share their experiences with others .
they support other people &apos;s mistakes .
and it shows other mistakes , not in the face , but in a loving way that all of them benefit .
and she works in a medical culture that recognizes that people fill the system with life , and when that is , people are also making mistakes from time to time .
so that the system has evolved to create backups which make it easier to find mistakes that are inevitable , and it &apos;s also allowing people to make loving spaces where everybody who &apos;s watching health care is actually a matter of what the potential mistake is , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going to be even rewarded for people like me .
my name is brian robicsek .
i &apos;m the new defining doctor .
i &apos;m a human . i &apos;m making mistakes .
but i &apos;m going to try . but i &apos;m going to try to learn how to pass it down .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re holding me , but i can live with it .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
it &apos;s about changing standards .
and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i &apos;ll tell you about three stories to use time .
the first story is charles darwin , one of my heroes .
you know , he was in 1835 .
you might think he &apos;s jawed , but that &apos;s not true .
he actually gathered fish .
he described one of them as a very , very common .
it was a grouwn .
until the &apos; 80s , he was raised in great style .
now he stands on the red list of dangerous species .
this story we &apos;ve heard many times from the galapagos , or other places , it &apos;s not very special .
and yet we still come to the galapagos .
we still think they &apos;re originally .
the brockers are still describing as untouched .
what &apos;s going on here ?
the second story is a different concept , which is transformative tailenous , focus .
because i experienced it when i was studying a lagoin in the west africa .
i went there because i grew up in europe and i wanted to work in africa later .
i thought i could integrate myself .
and i got a bad sunfire and was convinced that i really didn &apos;t get there .
it was my first sunfire .
as you can see , the lagoes of paldie and a few mangroves dropped .
there was colorful of about 20 feet , black kinner breasts , a subspecies of colorful .
the fish of this buntbaran was very ermature , and the fishermen lived well from it , and the fishermen lived well in ghana .
when i returned 27 years later , the fish were scolded on half of his size .
they grow up five centimeters .
they had been modified .
it was still fish .
people were still happy .
and the fish had too lucky to be there .
so there &apos;s nothing changed , and yet everything has changed .
my third little story is telling me about my mitership at the time of fishing in southeast asia .
in the &apos; 70s -- in the early &apos; 60s , europe has a lot of development projects .
fishing funding meant countries that have already 100 fish that have been called the industrial fishing catch this rather ugly ship .
i went to it and we set across the entire southern southern sea , and particularly in the javasee .
we didn &apos;t have words for what we started there .
i know the reason it was the ocean .
90 percent of our campaign were weakant , other animals that are connected to the cause .
the largest part of the fish , the small dots there on the rubble , the bback , were coral reef fish .
basically , the bottom of the ocean came back and then thrown back .
these images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast .
in a year , you take a census and then starts with the commercial fish catch .
the reason is going to change . out of -- in this case -- a hard reason or soft coral is going to be radier crap .
this is a dead turtle .
they weren &apos;t eaten , you threw them away because they were dead .
we started a living .
she wasn &apos;t drunk .
then they wanted to kill them because they could eat it well .
in fact , this mountain of race is accumulated by a fish every time you drive in areas where it has never been resolved .
it &apos;s not going to be documented .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
we fit our standards of the new level and we don &apos;t call ourselves in memory .
if you generalize it , this is what happens .
on the y-axis are some good things : biodiversity , number of orca , the green of their country , the water supply .
over time , it changes . it changes because for the people , of course , are their actions .
every generation is looking at the images that you &apos;re taking at the beginning of your conscious life , as a standard and everything of it .
the difference will then be done as loss .
but they don &apos;t notice the previous losses .
it can give a sequence of changes .
and at the end , you just want to get the peggles apart .
that &apos;s right now our goal .
we want to get things that are disappeared or things that are no longer like them .
now , you could think that the problem people who were sure the problem of people were living in predators , animals killed and realized only after a few generations what they had done .
because obviously there &apos;s an animal that &apos;s been very common before it dies .
so you don &apos;t have to lose animals often .
you lose ever-rare animals .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not being seen as a big loss .
at the time we focus on the big animals and in the sea , that &apos;s the big fish .
they become rare because we start them .
over time , there &apos;s little fish left and we think that &apos;s the vc .
the question is , why people accept this .
well , because they don &apos;t know it was different .
of course , many people , scientists , confirm it was really different .
you &apos;ll confirm it , because the evidence you were in a previous shape are not like the evidence you would like to do .
so , for example , there &apos;s an anecdote that the report of a capitalist sound sound that observed in this area of big fish , cannot be used , can be used by fishing scientists , because it &apos;s not &quot; scientific . &quot;
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in educated societies because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
this shows the enormous great role that can play a marine reserve .
because in marine reserves , we basically have the past .
we go back to the past that people can &apos;t understand because the standards have changed and very low .
so , the people who see a marine protected reserve and the insight of the view that allow them to return their standards .
what about the people who are not possible because they don &apos;t have access -- the people in the middle west ?
here , i think the art and the film may fill the gap , as well as simulation .
this is the simulation of chesapeake bay .
a long time ago there was gray whales -- 500 years ago .
and the color notes , you remember , remember &quot; avatar . &quot;
if you think of &quot; avatar , &quot; if you think about why people were so touching it -- except from the pocahona &apos;s story , why were they so touched by the picture world ?
because it says something in a way that has lost in a way .
so my recommendation , the only one i &apos;m going to give is about cameron ii .
thank you .
in the &apos; 80s , in the communist east germany , you had to , if you had a typewriter , those at the government .
they also had to record a leaf with unprecedented text from this written machine .
the reason for this : the government could follow back , where a text came from .
they found an article with false thought , they could find the creator of this thought .
and in the west , we couldn &apos;t understand how anyone could do this , and how much that would protect freedom .
in our own countries , we would never do something like this .
but if you buy a new color printer in 2011 today from the leading laser printers , and print a page , it has this side of bright yellow input on each page , in a pattern that &apos;s clear to you and retrace your printer .
that &apos;s what happens to us today .
and no one seems to fall on that .
and this was an example of which way our own governments against us , the citizens , the citizens .
and this is one of the three main sources of the existing online problems .
let &apos;s look at what &apos;s really happening in the world : we can divide attacks into categories .
we have three main groups .
there are online criminals .
for example , here , this is mr. dimitry golubow in the ukraine .
and the mode of online criminals are very easy to understand .
these people deserve money .
they use online attacks to make much money , a huge pile of money .
there are several known cases of online millionths , multimillionths that have their money through attacks .
this is wladii tsastsin from stetu in estonia .
this is alfred gonzste .
stephen watt .
bjnish sundin .
these are matthew anderson , tariq cr and so on and so forth .
these people have come to wealth online , but they have killed it illegal by using vijan , for example , to steal money from our bank bank as we do our online banking , or keylogger , which has collected our credit card online .
the american intelligence agency is two months ago the swiss account of mr. sam jain here , and on this accounts , 14.9 million dollars , when it turned out .
mr. jain himself is on open foot , which is unknown .
and i &apos;m saying that it &apos;s more likely to be the fact that we &apos;re going to be victims of a online endeavor than one of them in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this will only become worse .
in the future , most crime play online .
the second largest group that we see today is not motivated by money .
they &apos;re motivated by something else -- about it , a opinion , or by their audience .
groups like anonymous are up over the last 12 months , and they have become one of the main players on the field of online attacks .
so these are the three main attacks : criminals , who do it for money , hackers like anonymous , who do resistance , but the last group are nations , governments that lead attacks .
that &apos;s where the diginotar is .
it shows unprecedented what happens when governments attack their own citizens .
diginotar is a certificate for the netherlands -- or it was that .
in the last fall it had to be insolous , because diginotar was hacked .
somebody had collapsed and had the system hacked .
and last week in a meeting of the dutch government , i hired one of the senior groups of this group , whether he could have done it for possible , because of the diginotar people .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
now , how are people dying in a series of such hacks ?
diginotar is a certificate .
they &apos;re selling kate .
what do you do with certificate ?
now , a certificate , if you have a website with https , with ssl encrypted services , for example , gmail .
now we &apos;re all using , or many of us , gmail or one of their competitors , but these services are particularly common in dead states like iran , where you know that they can make more trust than local drugs and that they know that they can make more trust than the local government and they know that they can make more trust than the local government and that they are .
but if you look at a foreign
it &apos;s radioactive , and it &apos;s fake certificate .
and that &apos;s the case of diginotar .
how about the arab spring and the things that are happening in egypt ?
well , in egypt , they looted in in april of 2011 , the main headquarters of egyptian intelligence police , and they found a lot of records .
in these records , a folder called &quot; finantor . &quot;
and in this folder , the notes were in germany in germany that had sold to the egyptian government a few programs that they -- in very large frame -- any communication of egyptian citizens .
they had sold this program for 280,000 euros to the egyptian government .
the company headquarters is right here .
so western governments are eating totalitarian governments with aid for their own citizens .
but western governments also help themselves .
for example , in germany just a couple of weeks ago called the state of the state janer , which was a trojan , which was used by german government government to arrest their own citizens .
if you &apos;re going to be suspicious in a criminal case , it &apos;s pretty safe with your phone .
but today we are far beyond this .
they tap their internet connection .
they use resources like the state janer to watch their computer with a trojer that allows them to monitor their entire communication , to listen to her online conversation , to get their passings .
so when we think about things like this , the obvious answer to people would be , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it &apos;s not because i &apos;m a brown citizen .
i don &apos;t have to worry .
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
and that argument doesn &apos;t make sense .
privacy has to be given .
privacy is not the debate .
it &apos;s not a choice between privacy and safety .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
and as we today , in the year 2011 , our governments really trust our governments is every right that we &apos;re attacking forever .
and we trust , do we trust any of the future government , a government that we might have in 50 years ?
these are the questions that we have to address the next 50 years .
it may seem strange to you , but i &apos;m a big fan of concrete blocks .
the first concrete blockstones were made in 1868 , and it turned out to be a simple idea : modules from cement with solid measurements that fit together .
concrete building blocks were very quickly the most commonly charged contractions in the world .
they took us to build things that were larger than we , buildings , bridges , a stone after another .
essentially , the concrete building was built into the building block of our time .
almost a hundred years later , in 1947 , lego came out .
it was called the &quot; automatically charged rock . &quot;
and within a few years , lego went into every household .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion stones were produced -- or 75 stones for every person on this planet .
you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to create beautiful houses , beautiful bridges or beautiful buildings .
lego made it possible for everybody .
lego basically has the concrete block , the building block of the world , and it made a building block for our imagination .
in the same year at bell labs , the next revolution announced the next revolution .
and the transistor was a little plastic unit that made us from a world of static , cured blocks to a world in everything that was interactive .
like the concrete block , the transistor allows us to build much more complex circular cycles , a stone after another .
but there &apos;s a major difference : the transistor was only for experts .
i personally didn &apos;t accept the building block of our time for experts and so i decided to change it .
eight years ago , i was at the media lab and i started exploring this idea of how to put the power of engineers in the hand of artists and designers .
a few years ago , i started to develop littginges .
let me show you how they work .
littine is electronic modules that have a specific function .
they &apos;re preverse , light , sound and sensor .
and the best thing about it is they connect together with magnets .
so you can &apos;t get them together wrong .
the rocks are colored .
green is issue , blue is power , pink is descore and orange cables .
so everything you have to do is connect a blue and a green one , and you can build it very quickly .
they put a blue on a green , and they can make light .
you can put a switch in between and make you a little dimmer .
take the switch out to a pulclean , which is here , and you &apos;ve made a little blind .
add this buzzer to an extra effect , and they made a noise machine .
i &apos;ll stop that .
beyond the simple play , littine is actually quite powerful .
instead of controlling that you have to code , or you have to paint , you have to do it with simple , intuitive gestures .
so to speed up the blind or slow , just turn this button and make it faster or slower .
the idea behind littine is that it &apos;s a growing library .
we want to put every single interaction on this world in a utilizing stone .
lights , sound , solar elements , motors -- everything should be available .
we &apos;ve distributed littine to kids and see them playing .
and it was an incredible experience .
the most beautiful thing is how you start to understand the electronics that you don &apos;t learn in your life .
like a night light , or why the doors of the road remain open , or how a ipod respond to a touch .
we also brought littine to design schools .
so , for example , we had a designer with no experience in electronic things that started playing with littine as material .
here we see , with film , paper and water bottles , like geordie ...
a couple of weeks ago , we brought littine to risd and gave them some designers that had no technical experience -- just mining , wood and paper -- and they said , &quot; what . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project that they did , a controlled condute channel .
but wait , this is really my favorite project .
it &apos;s a hummer from play-doh , the fear of the darkness .
for those non-engineers , littine has another material , electronics was just another material .
and we want to make this material available for all available .
so littine is open source .
you can go to the website , you can go down all the designs and make it yourself .
we want the world to create the inventor , the inventor , because the world that we live in , this interactive world , belongs to us .
so , go ahead and start to invent it .
thank you .
