you know , one of the great verncs at travel and one of the pleasure in the race of the race is to live with the people who can remember the old days . the past still feels in the wind , you touch it on the rain of the plants .
just the knowledge that jaguar shaans still travel beyond the milky way or the importance of the oldest of the inuit of the elderly , or that in the himalayas , the buddhist is still the breath of the dharma , the central revelation of anthropology , which is the idea that the world we &apos;re living in aren &apos;t in a absolute sense , but a consequence of the reality of the anthropology , which is the thought that the world is in which we are living , right ?
and of course , we &apos;re all sharing the same adamentation .
we &apos;re all born . we get kids to the world .
we went through rituals .
we &apos;ve got to deal with the unappropriate separation of death , and so it shouldn &apos;t surprise us that we all sing , dance and art .
but interesting is the unique sound of the song , the rhythm of the dance in every culture .
it &apos;s not a matter of whether it &apos;s about the commution in the forests of borneo , or the voodoo-akolyths in haiti , or the warrior in the minut desert of northern kenya , the curaos in the 1960s that i &apos;ve traveled to in the desert a month ago , and this is the colleague that i have in the desert .
all these people teach us that there are other ways of living , other ways , other ways of guidance on earth .
and this is an idea that , if you think about it , can only fulfill hope .
together , the myriad cultures of the world form a net from spiritual and cultural life , which is the earth , and it &apos;s just as important to the earth as the biological life network that you know as the biosphere .
you can imagine this cultural life web as a race sphere , and ethnosphere can be considered the total total of all thoughts and dreams , myths and feelings that have been generated by the human imagination of consciousness .
the ethnic sphere is the great legacy of humanity .
it &apos;s the symbol of all of what we are and what we are as an astonishing species .
and as much as the biosphere has been strong , this happened with the ethnic sphere -- just even greater speed .
no biologist would say to us , for example , that 50 percent or more of all species are short before extinction , because it &apos;s simply not true . and yet , this -- the apokalyptic scenario on the field of biological diversity -- it &apos;s almost known as what we are optimistically familiar with in cultural diversity .
and the key indicator of this is extinction .
as any of you in this room were born , 6,000 languages were spoken on earth .
now , a language is not just the totality of the vocabulary or a series of grammatic .
a language is expression of the human spirit .
it &apos;s a means that the soul of a particular culture can find access to the material world .
every language is like an ancient forest of the mind , a turning point , an idea , a spiritual ecosystem .
and from those 60,000 languages today , as we &apos;re sitting here in monterey , the half don &apos;t whisten into the ears of children .
they &apos;re not taught anymore . that means if nothing is done , they &apos;re already dead .
what could be more lonely than being surrounded by the silence of one of the people who speak your language , no possibility to have the wisdom of the ancestors , or to expect the hope of the ancestors ?
and yet , this terrible destiny is actually driving someone on the earth , about every two weeks , because every two weeks , one of the two weeks of the old language dies in the grave .
and i know some of you say , &quot; is it not better ? &quot; would the world not be a better place if we &apos;re all going to talk to a language ?
let &apos;s be cogi . &quot;
and then you would suddenly see how it would be if you couldn &apos;t talk your own language .
so i &apos;d like to take you through a trip today to the ethnic sphere , a short journey through the ethnic sphere to try and make sure what &apos;s actually lost .
now there are some of us who really forget that if i say &quot; different possibilities of his , &quot; really different possibilities of his mean .
for example , take this child of the barasana in the northwest of the amazon , the people of the anaanaian , believe that they had a mythologically milk river from the east of saint snakes .
this is a people who are slightly different from the colors of blue and green , because the skies are filled with the forest that people depend on .
they have a very peculiar language , and a marriage script called the linguistic exotic players : you have to marry somebody who talks a different language .
all of this is expanding in mythological past , which is the kind of large houses that are spoken because of the missent six or seven languages , but that you &apos;re never going to hear anyone who learns a language .
you just listen to and start talking .
or , one of the most fascinating tribes i &apos;ve ever lived with , which i &apos;ve ever lived on in the northeast of ecuador , was an amazing people that was first in 1958 peace .
in 1957 , five missionators were trying to take contact , and they did a severe mistake .
they were flashing out of the air out of the air , which we would consider as a friendly gesture , forget that these people had never seen anything in the rainforest in their lives .
they took these photographs from the forest floor , tried to see behind the face or the character , didn &apos;t find that this was business maps of the devil , and they were killing the five missionaries of the spears .
but the waorani didn &apos;t only kill the foreign outliers .
they went through each other .
54 percent of deaths happened through drill .
we were following the genetic team eight generations , and we found two cases of a natural death , and when we asked people to do something about it , they decided that one of the people had been so old that he died because of his birth and we killed him yet .
but at the same time they had a clear knowledge of forest , which was amazing .
their hunters could smell the urine of a 40 steps , and determine what animal species of this owned .
in the early 80th years , i got a really amazing task , when my professor asked me if i was interested in going to haiti and to colonize the secret societies that the foundation of duvalier and tonton were used and the poison that was used to make zombies .
to give you a sense of this problem , i had to say something about this remarkable belief of the vogn , and voodoo &apos;s no cult of the black magic .
in the contrary , it &apos;s a complex metaphysical world .
it &apos;s interesting .
if i asked you to count the great world traditions , what would you say ?
christian , islam , buddhism , philanthroism or whatever .
a continent will always leave , because the guess was that there was no religious faith in sub-saharan africa , and , of course , there was one and voodoo is just the exaggeration of that very profound religious thought that came from the age of slavery .
but what &apos;s so interesting about voodoo is that living relationship between the living and the dead .
the living people living .
the ghosts can be imposed from under the great water , answers to the rhythm of the dance to maintain the soul of living temporary , so that the shareolyth for a brief moment becomes the god .
they say the voodooist likes to say , &quot; your white goes into church and talk about god .
we dance in the temple and we become god . &quot;
and because you &apos;re obsessed , you &apos;ll be taken by the spirit . how can you get damage ?
look at these amazing demonstrations : voodoo-akolyths in a spcestate , which is the fireend of coal without combustion , an amazing illustration of the ability to influence the body that it holds in a state of extreme arousal .
now , from all the people i met were the cogi from the sierra nevada in northern columia , the most extraordinary .
offspring of the old crinial civilization , the tanks of the coast of columbia , and in the consequence of the arrival , came back to the people in an isolated volcano that goes back across the coast of the coast .
in a bloodfront continent , these people were the only ones that were never conquered by the spaniards .
to the day day , you &apos;re going to be dominated by a ritual priesthood , but education is very extraordinary .
the young acolyths are separated at the age of three and four years of their families and in a shadow world of finy , in stone of the glacier for 18 years . two periods of time to reframe the nine months of the pregnancy that they spent in their body &apos;s lap , they are now voted in the great mother &apos;s lap .
and during that whole time , they &apos;re being introduced to the values of their society . values that sustain the claim that their prayers and their prayers , the cosmic -- could sustain the balance .
at the end of this amazing initiation , you &apos;re suddenly going to go out and look for the first time in your life , at age 18 , you see a sunline , and in this crystal moment of consciousness , when the sun starts to light on the scales of the first ever beautiful landscape , and the priests go , &quot; you see ? it &apos;s really how i &apos;ve been telling you . &quot;
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
they call the older brothers and say that we are the younger brothers that are responsible for the destruction of the world .
now this level of intuition becomes very important .
whenever we think about born and landscape , we either rown and the old smells of the nod-wild heron , which is in his simplification , or on the other hand , and say , these people are more connected to nature than we are .
so , offspring are neither sentimentally , nor they &apos;ll be thrown off by the nostalgia .
it &apos;s not going to be a lot of place in the malaria of australia , and the cold winds of tibet , but they still have an amazing nimbus of the earth , which is not based on the idea of being able to be close , but on a far subtle intuition , the idea that the earth can only exist because it &apos;s being laid into the human consciousness .
now , what does that mean ?
it means that a little kid from the andean , which is growing up in the belief that the mountain is an apu-spirit , which is your own or your destiny , becomes a very different human being , and a different relationship to this resource , which is a little child that can be grown out of montana .
whether it &apos;s a place of mind or a bunch of minds , it &apos;s irrelevant .
the interesting thing is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the nature .
i grew up in the forests of briticcolumbia , and i thought that these forests are there to be cut .
this made me to another human being as my friends under the kwakeutl , believing that these forests of the middle of the mouth of hukuk and the honical spirits , who are in the middle of the world , would be living in the middle of the world .
now , if you start looking at the idea that these cultures can create different realities , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries .
it &apos;s a photograph i took just last april in the northwest of the amazon .
this is ayahuasca , which many of you have heard of , the most powerful psychoental preparate from the repertoire of the shaman .
what ayahuasca is so intriguing is not just the pharmagic potential of this state , but it &apos;s going to be made out of two different sources of sources , and it &apos;s actually made out of two different sources . on the one hand , there &apos;s some sort of wooden caps that have a series of beaks in the family of the coffee of the coffee .
this plant contains some very strong tryptamine that the serotonin , dimethane tryptamine five and strategic tryptamologist in very similar .
if you &apos;ve seen the yanomomi , how you &apos;ve got this stuff going up , this substance that contains you from various species also have standardized cyptamine .
now , this powder is a little bit like being cut out of a gun of guns , which is , by barocks , and the landing on a sea of electricity .
it will not produce any distortion of reality , but the resolution of reality .
i even have with my professor , richard evan shuled , the man who led the psychedelic gorea with the discovery of magic mushrooms in mexico in the last 30 years , and i suggested that you couldn &apos;t discuss those tryptamine .
but the thing about tryptamins is that you can &apos;t be brived , because it &apos;s natural in the human gut , of course , monoamene oxidase , denaturizes .
you can only be absorbed with some other chemicals with some other chemicals that have mao denaturivers .
now the fascinating thing is that the builders are located in the lize , mao-doodle of exactly the kind of species that is necessary to power the tryptamine . so ask yourself .
how can these people from a 3,ora of 80,000 species are not able to find these two morphes in these two morphes that , if we combine this way , create a kind of biochemical version , so that the whole thing is bigger than the sum of its parts ?
we use this great euphemism , try and error , which turns out to be meaningless .
but say the americans say , &quot; the plant talks to us . &quot;
so what does that mean ?
this tribe , the cofan , have 17 varieties of ayahuasca that you all recognize in big distance in the forest , which is a kind of thing .
and then you ask them how they behazomy and they say , &quot; i thought you felt something about plants .
i mean , you don &apos;t know anything ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
so , it turns out you take each of the 17 varies in full moon and sing them in a different scale .
now , this doesn &apos;t bring you a ph.d. at harvard , but it &apos;s a lot more interesting than a tribe .
now , the problem problem is that even the problem is that even those of us who have the symbols of the people who are born for the difficult , they look as orgally and colorful , but somehow they &apos;re looking at the past as the real world , meaning our world .
so , the fact is that you don &apos;t remember the 20th century , in 300 years of your war or technical innovation , but rather than an era we were against , and the massive destruction of biological and cultural diversity on earth either or passive . so the problem isn &apos;t the change .
all cultures have always been involved in the dance with new living possibilities .
and the problem is not the technology .
the ambulance americans didn &apos;t hear less about the sioux than they were cutting and arrow , when americans stopped being americans when they were horse and horse cars .
not change and technology , the integrity of ethnic sphere . it &apos;s power . it &apos;s the ugly face of the universe .
and wherever you look around in the world , you will discover that these cultures are not the set of the set . these are dynamic peoples that will be used by their ability to move through their capacity of customization , whether it &apos;s in the case of the penine in the forest , and in the case of the yanora , which is , in the case , the middle of the flells , which is going to be polluted in the southern china , which is that it &apos;s going to be
or if we go to the mountains of tibet , where i &apos;m a lot of research , you &apos;re going to see ugly face of the political dominance .
you know , the genocide , the physical extinction of people will be convicted of general , but the ethnocide , the destruction of the lives of the people , won &apos;t just not be convicted , but generally , as part of a developmental strategy .
and you can &apos;t understand suffering if you haven &apos;t experienced it at the bottom .
i traveled to a boy with a young colleague , 6,000 miles of chnardu in westchina , from southeast tibet to lhasa and only when i came to lhasa , and i saw the face behind the statistics that were been turned to the statistics of the caeins .
the father of this young man was identified by the panny lama .
that meant he was immediately killed during the chinese invasion .
his uncle was his uncles in the diaspora who brought people to nepal .
his mother was locked , as punishment for -- to be wealthy for the crime .
he was sent to prison in the age of two years to hide under her rock balls , because she couldn &apos;t live without him .
the sister , who did these tacks , was brought into an educational camp .
and one day she walked on a wriw-band maos , and she had to do it for seven years in a heavy labor camp .
the lack of suffering can be intolerable , but the dexy of people &apos;s minds is something unforforable .
and at the end of that , we &apos;re really facing a choice . would we like to live in a monochromatic world of monotonia or in a polychromatic world of diversity ?
margaret mead , the great anthropologist in said before she died that it was the greatest fear that as we move towards a thread , we &apos;re not just going to see the entire range of human imagination , but we have missed the whole range of human imagination .
and it &apos;s humbling to think that our species may have existed since 600,000 years .
the neolithic revolution , which brought us agriculture , and in this moment , took us to the cult of the seed corper , which took poetry of the sancy of the prisa , and the hierarchy of the priest and the hierarchy -- just 10,000 years ago .
modern industrial world as we know it is hardly 300 years old .
now , this shallow story doesn &apos;t tell me that we all have answers to the challenges that we face in the next year .
if we ask these myriad world cultures about the importance of human questions , they respond to 10,000 different voices .
and in this song , we &apos;re going to rediscover the possibility of what we are : people with full consciousness that are aware of the importance that all people and gardens have to thrive a space , and there &apos;s great moments of optimism .
here &apos;s a photograph i took at the northern end of the baffin-islands when i went to the naruit , and this man , olriet , told me a wonderful story of father .
the eastern government is not always a very good deal with the inuit , and during the 30th years of our ministers , they were forced to pull in settlements .
the grandfather of this old man refused .
the family , the fear of his life , took him all the weapons and all the tools .
now you have to know that the inuit have no fear of the cold . they use them to their advantage .
the tracks tracks of their slecks were originally made of fish that was wrapped into carbucal skin .
the man &apos;s grandfather didn &apos;t really care about the arctic night or the sidewalk storm .
he snapped out outside , he left his pants out of the sea fluids and deferched in his hand , and when the fedies started freezing , he shaped them into the form of a measurement .
he emphasized on the sides of the heel , and when it was completely frozen , he had a dog .
he gave the dog and improvised the dog , and he took the the dog of the dog and improvised a little bit , a different dog , and she had a slipped on the ice cream with the wing knife .
you can &apos;t do anything like that .
and this is a symbol of the resistance of the inuit , and all the families in the world .
the eastern government gave the inuit in april to the full control of an area that is bigger than california and texas combined .
it &apos;s our new home , and it &apos;s called avsty .
it &apos;s an independent area . it &apos;s controlling all the mineral animals .
an amazing example of how a nation , a state that can be rebenign with his citizens and can reach .
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who have traveled to these distant goals of the earth , that they &apos;re not at all .
they are the home countries of somebody .
they represent parts of the human imagination that go back in past , and for all of us , the dreams of these children become part of the geography of our own children &apos;s dreams .
what we &apos;re trying to do at national geographic is that we believe that politicians will never achieve something .
we think polemik -- we believe that smallpox is not compelling , but we believe that storytelling can change the world and we &apos;re probably the best institution for storytelling in the world . our website is 35 million volumes every month .
156 nations are sending our tv channel .
our magazines are being read by millions .
and we &apos;re doing a series of trips to the ethnic sphere where we take our audience to places from such cultural wonders , that they &apos;re exposed to that , and hopefully they will take one after the other one that has contributed to the world that the wisdom of all humans can contribute to our collective well-being .
thank you .
what i &apos;m going to do first , as quickly as possible , is to show , is the basic work , a new technology that we have to microsoft as a part of a year ago , which is seadragon , and it &apos;s an environment where you can either have a local amount of visual material .
we see many , many gigabytes of digital photographs here that you &apos;re going to get seamlessly and continuously rearranged , in a way that can rearrange .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how many information we look at , how big these collections are , or how big the images are .
most of you are digital photographs of a camera , but this one is a scan of congress , and it &apos;s in a range of 300 megapixles .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference , because the only thing that can do the power of a system like this is the number of pixels on your screen right now . it has a very flexible architecture .
this is a whole book , an example of non-visual data .
this is colorful house of dickens . every spold is a chapter .
to prove that it really is a text and not about a picture , we can do something like that to really show that this one real representation of the context and no image is .
maybe this is an artificial way to read an e-book .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
this is a realistic case . this is a copy of the guardian .
every big picture is the beginning of a dissection .
and that really gives you the pleasure and the good experience of reading a magazine of paper or a newspaper , which is a kind of medium with multiple scales .
we also did something about the guardian of this particular subject .
we designed a false display with very high resolution , which is much higher than a normal display , and we added additional content .
if you want to see the functions of this car , you can see them here .
or other models , or even technical specications .
and this really reaches these ideas , these constraints for the available place on the screen .
we hope that this is not a pop-up silence and other nonsense -- that shouldn &apos;t be necessary .
of course , the mapping is one of the really obvious applications for technology like this .
and i really don &apos;t want to spend a lot of time to say that we &apos;re also going to be involved in this area .
but these are all roads in the united states .
overfitting up on the top of the reserve of nasa .
let &apos;s take a different step now .
this is even live in the internet now . you can check it out .
this is a project called photosynth , which actually connects two different technologies together .
one is seadraper , and the other is a very good research on computer vision , which is a college student , a university student of the university of steve , under the ceo of steve .
and rick szeliski of microsoft was done , a very good collaboration .
so this is live on the internet . it &apos;s driven by seadragon .
you can see that if we create these kinds of views , where we can go through images and make this experience of multiple times .
but the spatial orientation of the images is actually actually meaning .
the computer vison algorithms put these images together with the real room , where these images that were made near the gravel of the grass in the eastern rockies in the eastern rockies , and they &apos;re looking at elements of the stabilized slides , and these things are all in relation to each other .
i don &apos;t know exactly if i have time to show you other environments .
there are some more spatial ones .
i would like to just show one of the original data sentences of noah and this is from a early prototype of photosynth that we &apos;ve been working on in summer to show you what i think is really the punch line of this technology , which is a photosyncator , and it &apos;s not necessarily so obvious if you look at the environments that we have .
we had to make ourselves concerned because of the lawyers .
this is a kind of reconstruction of the cathedral dame , which is only in the computer with images of flickr . just give you an emergency lady in flickr , and you &apos;re going to get pictures of men in t-shirts and on the university site , and so on , and so on , each of these orneys , that are known as this model .
so , this is all patr-y images , and all of them are in the middle of relation to each other .
and we can navigate this very simple way .
you know , i &apos;ve never thought i &apos;m going to work at microsoft .
i &apos;m very grateful for the reception here .
so , i guess you can see that this is a lot of different kinds of cameras : everything is , from the hand camera to the professional , a fairly large number of you that have been put together in this environment .
and if possible , i &apos;ll find some of the strange ones .
many of you are covered by faces , etc .
somewhere here are a series of photographs -- here they are .
this is actually a poster of emergency dame that was recorded right .
we can change from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
the point here is that we can do things with social environments . it &apos;s now collected data from all of the collective memory of how , visual the earth looks -- and everything is connected to each other .
all these photographs are connected to each other , and it creates something larger than the sum of parts .
they get a model that comes from all over the world .
consider this as the sequel of the work of stephen law&apos;s at virtual earth .
and this is something that , through the complexity that people use it , is growing and using the user to use the user .
their own photos are being made by metadata , which has a different person .
if somebody has done the trouble and it has all of these sacred rings , and divides who they are , then my photo of the derre cathedral is suddenly pumped with all of these data , and i can use them as a starting point to take place in this room , which is the photos that are using the photos of other people and using the more profound form of social experience .
and of course , byproduct of all of these are the immense virtual models of each interesting part of the earth , not just through overflight or satellite images and so on , but through collective memory .
thank you .
now , how do you get it right ? your software allows you to do that in a particular time , within the next few years , all the images that are being used in the world is essentially interconnected ?
yes . she doesn &apos;t do anything else .
if you want to create it , it &apos;s hyperlinks between the images .
and it does this because of the content in the images .
and that &apos;s really exciting when you think about the amount of semantic information that many of these images have .
as if you &apos;re doing a web search for images , where you enter sentences and the text of the website has a lot of information about that , which is the picture .
but how would it be that if the image is linked to all their images ?
and then the scope of semantic cross-connection , and the abundance that make it , really , is enormous . it &apos;s a classic web effect .
blaise , it &apos;s really incredible . very lucky desire .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m going to tell you some things from my book , which , i hope , are with other things that you &apos;ve already heard of , and i &apos;ll try to create a few connections , if you haven &apos;t noticed these .
i want to start with what i call &quot; official dogma . &quot;
the official dogma of what ?
the official belief of all western industrialized societies .
the official dogma works this way , when our goal is to maximize the existence of the wealth of our citizens , it &apos;s all about the freedom of the individual .
the reason for this is that freedom itself is good in itself , valuable , meaningful , a consistent premise for the human .
when people have freedom , each of us is for themselves to do things that maximize our common wisdom , and nobody has to decide for us .
the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice .
the more choices people have , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , the more common they have .
this is , i think , so deep in our water supply that it would not make sense to question .
and it &apos;s also rooted in our lives .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what modern progress allows us to do .
this is my supermarket . no big .
i just want to say a little bit about salaturure .
there &apos;s 175 dress in my supermarket when they don &apos;t count the 10 different olive oliolical oils and 12 balmites that they could buy to make a large number of pilings in the unprobable case that no 175 in the store is for you right .
so that &apos;s how the supermarket is .
and then you go to the consumer electronics to put together a stereo plant -- speaker , cd-player , a race player , radio , commitment . and in this one electronics , there &apos;s so many stereo .
we can put 6.5 million different stereo together from the components that are offered in this business .
you have to admit that this is a big selection .
in other areas -- the world of communication .
there was a time when i was a boy , you could have every phone vendor that you wanted to do as long as it came from ma bell .
they rented their phone . they didn &apos;t buy it .
a consequence of that was that the telephone was never broken .
these days are over .
we now have almost an infinite choice of telephones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
my favorite it is in the middle -- charts of playeres , wet haas trimmer and crème brfo .
and if you haven &apos;t seen that yet in your business , you can be sure that you will soon be .
and what it does is it makes people walk into the business and ask that question .
you know what the answer to this question is ?
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
it &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
in other aspects of life that are a lot of significant than buying things , it &apos;s the same explosion of choice .
health care is no longer the case in the united states that you go to the doctor and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , you go to the doctor and the doctor tells you , we could do a or we could do b .
a has these benefits and risks .
b has these benefits and risks . what do they want to do ?
and they say , &quot; doctor , what do i do ? &quot;
the doctor says a has these benefits and risks and b has the benefits and risks .
what do you want to do ?
and if you say , &quot; if you were , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not . &quot;
the result is -- we call it &quot; patients autonomy . &quot; it sounds like a good thing , but in reality , it &apos;s a shift of the load of choices for the meeting of choice of someone who knows -- &quot; the doctor &quot; -- &quot; the patient &quot; is a decision to make -- name the patient .
there &apos;s an enormous marketing for the prescription drugs for people like you and me , if you think about it , that if you think about it , you don &apos;t buy it .
why do they hire us if we can &apos;t buy ?
the answer is : you &apos;re expecting to call the doctor at the next morning and ask for a change of competition .
something so profound as our identity is now a question of choice , how to show this slide .
we don &apos;t have identity , we invent it .
and we &apos;re so often inventing ourselves as we want .
that means that every day , if you wake up the morning , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time where the standard assumption was that almost every one of them had one and they were so fast , and then quickly got kids like they could .
the only real choice was &quot; who , &quot; not when , and not what they did after that .
now , everything is easy to have .
i teach wonderful intelligent students , and i give them 20 percent less work than i did .
and that &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , and not because they &apos;re less carefully careful .
it &apos;s because you &apos;re working with other things , you ask yourself , &quot; should i marry or not ? should i marry ?
should i marry later ? should i have children , or do they have a career ? &quot;
these are all basic questions .
and they &apos;re going to answer the questions of whether that means to make all the tasks that i give you and not a good note in my class .
and in fact , they should . these are important to answer questions .
work -- we &apos;re blessed , as carl pointed out , with the technology that allows us to work every minute every single day from every place on the planet -- until on the edge hotel .
and by the way , there &apos;s a corner that i &apos;m not going to tell you about , which is the wireless basin .
i &apos;m not going to tell you , because i want to use it .
so what it means , this incredible freedom of choice we have in terms of making decisions , again and again , whether we should work or not work .
we can watch our kids playing football , and we have our mobile phone on a hip , and our blackberry on other waats , and our laptop probably on our lap .
and even if you &apos;re all off , every minute we &apos;re looking at our child at the mutile of a football game , we &apos;re also asking ourselves , &quot; should i take this call ?
should i respond to this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
and even when the answer to the question , &quot; no , &quot; it &apos;s certainly going to be a very different experience of your child &apos;s game .
everywhere we look , big things and small things , material things and lifestyle , life is a question of choice .
and the world in which we lived looked like this .
so i want to say , there were some choices , but not everything was a question of choice .
and the world that we &apos;re living in now looks like this .
and the question is , are the good news or bad news ?
the answer is yes .
we all know what &apos;s good about it , so i &apos;m going to talk about what &apos;s bad about it .
all these choices have two effects , two negative effects on people .
one effect , paradoxer , is that he &apos;s paralyzed rather than free .
with so many options you can choose , it will be very difficult to decide .
i &apos;m going to give you another dramatic example of this , a study about investment in volunteers .
a colleague of mine had access to investment records from vanvores , the giant fondsociety of about one million employees and about 2,000 different jobs .
and what she found was a 10 investment fund that gave the employer , the participation for two percent .
they provide 50 investment fund -- 10 percent less employees than if they only offer five . why ?
because it &apos;s 50 investment fund that stands to choice , it &apos;s so hard to decide which you want to vote for tomorrow .
and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , it never comes .
you know , it &apos;s not just that people have to eat dog food when they go to retirement , because they don &apos;t have enough money to go to the celebration , it also means that they make great investment of their employer .
not giving participation to 5,000 to 5,000 dollars a year , which would have been happy to reproduce .
paralysis is a consequence of many choices .
and i think it makes the world look like this .
they want to make the decision really , if it &apos;s for all the eals , right ?
they don &apos;t want to choose the wrong investment fund , or the wrong salchure .
so this is one effect . the other effect is that even if we overcome the paralysis and make a decision , we end up getting less content with the outcome of choice than if we had the opportunity to decide less .
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is due to the great choice of different salces , if they buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and , which is salatous ? it &apos;s easy to imagine that they could have had a different choice , and what &apos;s happened is that they have a good choice , and what is happening is that they have a good choice .
the more possibilities there are , the easier it is to regret at all that is disappointing to choice they meet .
secondly , what economists call opperdom costs .
dan gilbert did a big point of this morning by telling the way that we evaluate things , depends on what we compare .
well , if there &apos;s a lot of alternatives to think about , it &apos;s easy to imagine more attractive properties of alternatives that allow them to be less content with the alternatives that they chose .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not new york , i apologize .
but here &apos;s what you should have thought .
here &apos;s a few on the hamptons .
very expensive real estate .
beautiful beach . great day . you &apos;ve got it all over yourself .
what could be better ? &quot; damn &quot; the man thinks , &quot; it &apos;s august .
everyone in my manhattan neighborhood is gone .
i could park directly before my house . &quot;
and he spends two weeks from the thought he missed the possibility , day day , a great parking lot .
oppertunitarian costs lower happiness that we get through our selection , even though what we chose is fantastic .
and the more possibilities for choice , the more attractive properties of these choices in the opperdom cost .
here &apos;s another example .
now , this cartoon makes some statements .
he makes a statement about living in the right now and perhaps doing things about it .
but one more important thing he &apos;s doing is , always who you choose for one thing , you don &apos;t decide to do other things .
and these other things like many attractive traits , and it &apos;s going to be what they &apos;re going to do less comfortable .
third : eskalation of expectations .
this struck me when i wanted to exchange my jeans .
i &apos;m wearing jeans , almost the whole time .
and there was a time in which there was only jeans in a way , and they bought them , and they were very poor , they were incredibly uncompatible , and they had carried them long enough , and they &apos;ve had , &quot; ok , &quot; ok .
so to buy new jeans for many years after the old , and i said , &quot; i would have like a couple of jeans , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
and the salesman said , &quot; do you want a snake , easy or wide ?
do you want buttons or outbreaks ? stone or acid ?
do you want jeans with holes ?
you want to cut down the bottom , thank you , blah , blah blah , blah , blah .
my jaw was down and after i told myself , &quot; i would have liked the way the only way . &quot;
he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour to try and try all of these damn jeans , and i put the business -- and i say the truth -- with the best appropriate jeans i ever had .
i had better . all these choices allowed me to do better .
but i felt bad .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try and explain it myself .
the reason that i felt bad was i felt bad with all these available possibilities , my expectations for what a good pair of jeans were , went up .
i had very low expectations . i had no concrete expectations when there was only one way .
when they got in 100 ways , they would have to be perfect .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so i compared what i expected to do , and what i expected to do , and what i was expected to do was compared to what i expected .
adding the possibilities of people &apos;s lives will inevitably increase expectations that people have about how well they will be .
and this leads to less happiness , even though the results are good .
no one in the world of marketing knows this , because if you would , you don &apos;t know what it &apos;s about .
the truth is more like this .
the reason it was all better than anything was worse than anything was worse than anything was bad for people to make a comfortable surprise .
today , in the world we live in -- we &apos;re wealthy , industrialized citizens , with perfection as expectation -- the best for the one you can hope to hope is things like you would expect .
you &apos;re never going to be amazed , because your expectations , because your expectations , are home .
the secret to happiness -- this is what you &apos;ve all come for -- the secret to happiness is low expectations .
i want to say -- a short autobiographical moment -- that i married with a woman , and she &apos;s really wonderful .
i couldn &apos;t have done it better . i didn &apos;t decline .
but rainfall is not always a bad thing .
finally , a consequence of buying a bad fall of jeans when there is only one way to buy that if you &apos;re uncontent , and you ask yourself why , who &apos;s responsible , the answer is clear . the world is responsible . what could you do ?
if hundreds of different kinds of jeans are available , and they buy the disappointing , and they ask why , who is responsible ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer to the question is : you .
they could have done it better .
with 100 different kinds of jeans in the window , there &apos;s no excuse for mistakes .
and so , when people make decisions , and even when the results of decisions are good , they feel disappointed about themselves .
clinical depression exploded in the industrial world in the last generation .
i think it &apos;s a significant -- not the only , but it &apos;s a significant part of that explosion of depression , and also suicide , is that people have the disappointing , because their standards have to be so high , and then , if they have to explain these experiences themselves , they think it would be their fault .
and so the image result is that it &apos;s much better to us , potentially , and we feel bad .
so let me remind you .
this is the official dogma that we all think is right , completely wrong . it &apos;s not true .
there &apos;s no question , which is a little bit better than not , but it doesn &apos;t follow that more choices than something .
there &apos;s a magical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty sure we &apos;ve missed this dot for a long time to make the difference .
now , as a rule question -- i &apos;m almost done -- as a rule , which is about thinking about thinking about it , which is what all of these choices do in the developed societies , is the material wealth .
there are many places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard of many of them whose problem is not too big .
their problem is they have too little .
so things i &apos;m talking about are a strange problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what &apos;s so frustrating and angry is that steve levitt has told them about how these expensive and heavy bombs are not helping to go to bombs . it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy to help them .
they even hurt .
they &apos;re worried about that we &apos;re bad there .
when something of what people of our society are allowing to make decisions about the societies in those societies , that dignity would not just improve the lives of people , but our dignity will be improved .
economists call this a pareto approach .
income distribution is going to make it happen that it &apos;s all better -- not just the poor -- because all of these big selection shows us .
finally , please read this cartoon , and , a highly developed person , says , &quot; ah ! what does this fish know ?
you don &apos;t know anything in this gold jar . &quot;
misproof imagination , a short view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i read it first .
but the more i thought about it , the more i came to the view of the fish .
because the truth is that if you break the gold glass , everything is possible , you don &apos;t have freedom . you have paralysis .
if you break the goldfish glass so everything is possible , you reduce happiness .
they increase the paralysis and reduce happiness .
everybody needs a gold glass .
this is almost too limited to certainty -- potentially for the fish , definitely for us .
but the abhandie of a metaphorical gold jar is a recipe for misery , and , i guess , disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects before , about the human genome and what that might mean , and the discovery of new groups of genes .
in fact , we start from a new point : we &apos;ve digitized biology and now we try to get from the digital code into a new phase of biology by designing new life and building .
we &apos;ve always tried to ask meaningful questions .
what &apos;s life ? it &apos;s something i think many biologists have tried to understand and that on different levels .
we &apos;ve tried different approaches to simplify it up to the minimum components .
we &apos;ve calculated nearly 20 years . when we sequenced the human genome , the shift from the analog world of biology to the digital world of the computer .
now , we &apos;re trying to ask whether we can regenerate life or whether we can make new life out of this digital universe ?
this is the map of a small organism , mycoplasma violin &apos;s tongue , which has the smallest genome of a species that can replicate itself in the lab , and we &apos;ve tried whether we can do that with a smaller genome .
we &apos;ve done it at about a hundred genes from the 500 or something that is here .
but if we look at this metabolic map , which is very simple , compared to our . trust me , that &apos;s simple . but if we look at all of these genes that we can eliminate one after the other , it would be very improbable to a living cell .
so we decided that it &apos;s the only way to go forward to this chromosome , which allows us to vary the individual components and ask some of these fundamental questions .
and so we started the question , can we do a chromosome ?
does it allow the chemistry to make the really big molecules that have never been done before ?
and , if we can do that , can we start the chromosome ?
a chromosome is just a piece of infilmed chemical material .
our steps at the historical alization of life were exponentially .
now , our ability to write genetic code is very slow , but it &apos;s also increasing , and our final point would be put on an exponential curve .
we started 15 years ago .
it actually took some years with a bioethical review before we did the first experiments .
it turns out that dna is very difficult .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that are able to make small pieces of dna , 30 to 50 letters long , but it &apos;s a decentralized process , the longer you make a piece , the more mistakes happen .
so we had to develop a new way of putting these little pieces together , and we could correct the mistakes .
this was our first attempt , starting with the digital information , the genome phi x 174 .
it &apos;s a small virus killing the bacteria .
we made small pieces , made a error correction , and we had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
the exciting phase came when we took this piece of inconsistent chemical and made it into a bacterium , and the bacteria started reading the genetic code and made viral particles .
the viral particles were then released by the cells , and they came back and killed e.coli .
i talked to the oil industry recently , and they said that they were doing this model .
they laughed more than this .
so we think that this is a situation in which software can actually build its own hardware in a biological system .
but we wanted to go a lot further . we wanted to build a whole bacterial chromosome , and it has more than 580,000 letters of genetic code , so we thought we could build it in casseds of the size of the virus in order to understand what the individual components of a living cell are .
design is the key , and if you want to start with digital information in the computer , this digital information really needs to be wrong .
when we first sequenced the genome in 1995 , the error rate had a mistake in a 10,000 base pairs .
we found at resopen to 30 mistakes , if we had used the original sequence , it would never be possible .
part of the design is to make pieces that are 50 letters long , and you have to add the other 50 letters to get to build smaller sub-units to build these together .
we &apos;ve built unique elements here .
you may have heard that we &apos;ve built watermarks .
think about it : we have a four-letter code : a , c , g and t. .
these letters -- these letters -- these letters encode about 20 amino acids ; and there &apos;s a single purpose for each of these amino acids .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , sentences , thoughts .
we just signed up .
some people were disappointed that it was no poetry .
we designed the pieces so that we could just divide it down with enzymes . there are enzymes that repair them and put together .
and we started making pieces , starting with pieces of the five to seven letters of letters , to make these pieces of each other up to 24,000-letter pieces to put these together together until 72,000 .
in every step we produced these pieces in overshot that we could sequence them , because we tried to create a very robust process in a minute .
we &apos;ve tried to get to the point of car recognition .
so , this looks like a basketball poster .
if we get to these really big bits -- with over 100,000 base pairs -- then they &apos;re not going to grow up in e. coli . it &apos;s going to increase all the possibilities of modern molecular biology , and so we set up to other mechanisms .
we knew about a mechanism of homedoc recombination that is using biology to repair dna that can put these pieces together .
here &apos;s an example of this . there &apos;s an organism called deinococcus radio for the three million wheel radiation .
you see in the upper field that its chromosome falls apart .
12 to 24 hours later , it turned back like it was .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
these organisms can be completely dry , they can even live in a vacuum .
i &apos;m absolutely sure life exists in space , and can move on the search for aquatic conditions .
in fact , nasa showed that there &apos;s a lot of it out there .
here &apos;s a shot of the molecule that we &apos;ve created by using these processes -- actually , we &apos;ve used heesy mechanisms with the right design of the pieces of design , and yeast builds these together .
this is not an electron graph recording , it &apos;s a regular microscope shot .
it &apos;s such a big molecule that we can actually see it with the light microscope .
these are footage about six seconds .
this is the publication we did recently .
these are about 580,000 letters on genetic code . it &apos;s the largest molecule that has ever been created by humans .
it has a molecular weight of 300 million .
if we were to print it from 10 and a half , it would include 142 pages , just to print this genetic code .
well , how do we start a chromosome ? how do we activate it ?
obviously , it &apos;s a very simple virus . it &apos;s a lot more complicated with bacteria .
it &apos;s also easier when you &apos;re in eukaryonites , like we are , you just take the nuclear out and you have another in it , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;ve all heard about cloning .
in archaebacteria , the chromosome is embedded into the cell , but recently we &apos;ve shown that you can do a full transplant of a chromosome from a cell to another , and it can activate .
we would clean up the chromosome of a microspecies , and we said , &quot; these two as far as human beings and mice , we gave some extra-genes that we could pick this chromosome , and we put it in a cell , and it &apos;s been quite amazing as we put it in a cell -- and it &apos;s been really surprising to us .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
in fact , we thought this is the end , but we &apos;ve tried to get the process a little bit further .
this is the main mechanism of evolution here .
we find all sorts of species here that have taken a second chromosome or a third of any , every time , for thousands of characteristics into one species .
so people who think of evolution as a gene has changed a lot of the biology .
there are enzymes called the restrictiones that actually digest dna .
the chromosome that was in the cell didn &apos;t have anything ; the chromosomes that we put in .
it became expristed in the cell and realized the other chromosome as alien material dides , and we only had one cell at the end of a new chromosome .
it turned out to be blue because of the genes we added .
and after a very short time , all of the characteristics of species were lost and conformed completely into a new species based on the new software that we have given into the cell .
all the proteins changed the membranes -- when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we &apos;ve created .
it may sound like genomic alchimie , but we can , by moving the software dna , things quite dramatically change .
now , i argued that this is not the ambulance -- that &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years of evolution .
and i argued that we may be able to create a new form of the chambrian explosion in which there could be massive new species of education based on this digital design .
why should we do that ?
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
we &apos;ve been growing up to nine billion people in the next 40 years .
to put it in my context , i was born in 1946 .
today , three people on this planet are still in 1946 ; within 40 years , it will be four .
we have problems with food , with fresh and clean water , medicine , fuel for 6.5 billion people .
it becomes a challenge for nine offer .
we need about five billion tons of coal , 30-plus billions of barrels of oil . that &apos;s a hundred million barrels a day .
if we think about biological processes or any process to replace that , it becomes a huge challenge .
then , of course , there &apos;s all the co2 from this material that &apos;s in the atmosphere .
we now have our discoveries from all over the world , a database of about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the design components of the future .
the electric industry industry had a dozen components and look at the diversity of it .
we &apos;re in the first line of the limits of biological reality and to those of us .
we have technologies today because of these fast incarcerators to do what we call the combined genetics .
we now have the ability to build a large robot of the millions of chromosomes a day .
if you think of these 20 million different genes , or to optimize these processes to make nerves or drugs new vaccines , we can change more molecular biology than the last 20 years of science .
and it &apos;s only excluding selection . we can select for life skills , production of chemicals or fuel production , and so on .
this is a shot of the design of design that we &apos;re working on , and you &apos;re actually designing new species on the computer .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know how it &apos;s going to look . we know exactly how the genetic code will look .
we &apos;re now focusing on greenhouse levels of the fourth generation .
they &apos;ve recently seen corn ethanol , which is just a bad experiment .
we have a rising generation of the two-ten- and third generation that &apos;s going to get a lot higher , much more likely to have , like alberta , or different kinds of butans .
but , as we think , the only way that biology is going to have a huge impact without the cost of the cost of food , or the limitation of their availability , is when we see co2 as the initial material , and therefore we &apos;re working on cells that go away .
and we think that we will be the first generation of the fourth generation , and that &apos;s about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
but in our discovery of the world , we have all kinds of different ways .
this is an organism we described in 1996 .
he lives in the deep sea , about a half-and-a-half miles deep , in almost cooking water temperatures .
it &apos;s turning carbon dioxide into methane by using hydrogen as a source of energy .
we &apos;re looking at whether we can use carbon co2 which could just be brought to production , convertate the co2 in fuel to push this process .
within a short period of time , we think we could be able to solve one of the fundamental questions of life .
you know , we really -- moderate goals like the substitute of all petrochemical industry . right . if you couldn &apos;t do that at ted , where else is going to be ?
but the same thing we &apos;re working on right now is to use the same approaches for the development of vaccine .
they &apos;ve seen this year with flu , we &apos;re always a year back in the back , and we have a dollar too little if it comes to the right vaccine .
i think that that can be changed by remixing these kinds of technologies in the suburbs .
this is what perhaps the future might look like with changes , can be accelerated today by the evolution tree with synthetic bacteria , archaes , and perhaps eukaryonents .
we &apos;re going to be able to improve from light to light . our goal is that we have a chance to survive long enough to do that . thank you .
on the last ted conference , i gave a introduction to the lhc .
and i promised to come back to explain how the machine works .
so , as far as it is . and for all those of you who weren &apos;t there at the time , the lhc is the biggest scientific experiment that became ever -- 27 miles in diameter .
his job is to create conditions that exist less than a billionth second after the beginning of the universe -- and to 600 million times within a second .
it &apos;s just breathambitious .
this is the machine underneath gene .
we take images of these mini-big big ones in detectors .
i &apos;m working on this . he &apos;s called a atlas detector -- 44 meters in the thick , 22 meters in diameter .
here &apos;s a spectacular picture of atlas in construction that you see the scale .
at the 10th of september , the machine was running for the first time .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
it caused tremendous amounts in the control room .
it &apos;s a picture of the first increase that the entire path around the lhc took back to a part of the lhc , to make a rain of particles on the detector .
in other words , when we saw this picture at september 10 , we knew that the machine works what a great triumph is .
i don &apos;t know if this was the biggest one , or this , when someone went to the google side and found the starting side .
it means we &apos;ve reached a cultural impact next to the scientific .
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine to do with these wires -- that golden wires here .
these wires lead 13-thousands when the machine goes on high performance .
now , the engineers are going to look at you and say , &quot; no , don &apos;t do that . these are little wires . &quot;
you can afford that because if you go very far down , you &apos;re going to be something called a superlot .
so in minus 271 degrees , kolder than the space between the stars , these wires can hold the tension .
in one of the connections , between over 30 thousand magnets in the lhc , there was a built-in defect .
and by doing that , the wires filled with smaller , and 13-thousand ampes suddenly signed electric resistance .
this was the result .
now , all this is even more amazing when you imagine that the magnets weigh over 20 tons of magnitude .
so we discussed about 50 of the magnets .
and they had to remove what we did .
we created them , repair them .
they &apos;re all back on their way back .
by march march , the lhc will be functional again .
we &apos;re going to turn it on , and we can collect the first data in june or july , and we can bring our journey on to find out what the building blocks of the universe are .
now , of course , on a way of taking accidents back to the value of science and engineering , it &apos;s easy to dismiss .
i think the fact that it &apos;s so hard that we reach beyond our limitations , the value of things like the lhc .
i &apos;m going to leave my final words from a english scientist . humphrey davy , who , i guess , when he carried the credit experiments of his teaching defender , was his teaching michael faraday , he said , &quot; nothing is so dangerous for the development of the human spirit , that our scientific notions are the case that our scientific ideas are not a mysterious thing , and that &apos;s not a new worlds . &quot;
thank you .
i &apos;m a writer .
writing books is my job , but of course , it &apos;s more than that .
it &apos;s also my big , life-long love and fascination .
and i don &apos;t expect that that will ever change .
however , shorter things have happened in my life , and my career , which brought me to try and rethink my relationship with this work .
this extraordinary event was that i was writing a book recently -- a biography called the therapist &apos;s name , wisconsin , love , love -- that , decided to be different from all of my previous books in the world , and it was a big mega-incident thing .
the result is that , no matter where i &apos;m going , i &apos;m going to be treated as if i &apos;m the set .
seriously -- shut up !
for example , they &apos;re very concerned to me and say , &quot; don &apos;t you fear that you will never meet that success ?
do you have no fear of being able to write your whole life and never create a book that &apos;s interested in anyone in the world ?
okay , that &apos;s really the courage .
but it would be worse if i wouldn &apos;t remember that i told myself about 20 years ago when i first told a teenager that i wanted to be writer with the same kind of fear of fear .
people said , &quot; do you have no fear , ever succeed ? &quot;
do you have no fear that the humiliation of a dissaying ?
do you have no fear that you &apos;re going to leave your life for your life and never create anything and that you &apos;re going to die in a shock space -- your mouth filled with the bitter hands of failure ? enriutes filled with the bitter ?
that &apos;s what you know .
the answer -- the short answer to all these questions : philanthroja . ambulance .
yeah , i &apos;m scared of all these things .
and i always had .
and i &apos;m afraid a lot more things that nobody would follow .
like algae , and other terrible things .
but , if it &apos;s about writing , i &apos;ve been thinking about that , and i ask myself , why ?
is that sensible ?
is it logical that someone should be expected to be afraid to do the work that he feels to do ?
and what &apos;s going on with the creative tools that they make us insecure about each other &apos;s mental state -- in a way , how other professions don &apos;t do it ?
my father , for example , was chemist , and i can &apos;t remember in his 40 years as a chemist that was asked if he was afraid to be chemist .
with your chemist blockade , john -- how about you ?
it just didn &apos;t come , you know ?
but to be fair -- the group of chemists don &apos;t have the centuries of alcohocurious manx depressed people .
we authors seem to have this kind of call , but not just the writers , but the creative of all genres , they seem to have this call , mental unstable .
everything you need to do is to look at the bitter death numbers of really great heads from the 20th century , the young and a lot of them died .
and even the ones who didn &apos;t actually get rid of metabolism seemed to be really neglected .
norman matamer : before his death in his last interview : philanthrogeneach of my books has killed me a little bit further .
an extraordinary statement that you can do about your life .
but we don &apos;t even know if we hear somebody like this , because we &apos;ve been familiar with these kinds of statements since the long time we &apos;ve been doing this kind of thing , and we &apos;ve kind of engaged the perception that creativity and wisdom , of course , are sort of , of course , and that art -- at the end -- always leads to the sea .
the question i want to ask you today is , is this idea for you all right ?
don &apos;t you feel that ? because with just one centimeter degree -- i feel not comfortable with this notion at all .
i think it &apos;s fine .
and i think it &apos;s dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to watch how it &apos;s taken in the next century .
i think it &apos;s better if we encourage our big creative creative lives .
and i definitely know that for me -- in my situation -- very dangerous would be , to start this dark path of reasoning , sort of -- especially in the fact that i &apos;m in my career .
this is -- look : i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m just about 40 years old .
i may have another 40 work for me .
and it &apos;s very likely that everything that i &apos;m going to write from now about the world is being saved by the work that came out of my last book , right ?
i &apos;m just saying it , because we &apos;re all kind of friends here -- it &apos;s extremely likely that my biggest success is behind me .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
these are the kind of thoughts that someone can get to start at 9 o &apos;clock in the morning , and i don &apos;t want to .
i would rather continue to do this work that i love .
so the question is : how ?
after some time of reflection , i seem to be able to write to continue to write a kind of protective psychological constructed .
somehow , i &apos;ve got to find a way of writing a safe distance between me , writing a safe distance about how the reaction is going to be .
while i was looking for models in the last year to do this , i &apos;ve been looking at it in the past , and i &apos;ve tried to find other societies to see if they might have gotten better or rational ideas about how to help them with creativity .
this quest me to the old greece and the old rome .
please follow me , because the circle will close again .
but in the old greece and rome , people don &apos;t believe that creativity comes from people , ok ?
they believed that creativity was a kind of divine spirit , which was from a distant , unknown source to the people -- from untapped , unknown reasons .
the greeks called these divine ditality of creativity in creativity .
so socrates is known that he believed he would have predicted that he would have chosen to come out of a distance .
the roman idea , the same idea , called this kind of body creative mind , a therapist genius .
this is great . the roman didn &apos;t really think a genius was a very smart individual .
they believed that a genius was this kind of magical divine creature , which was believed that it literally lives in the walls of an artist of an artist -- like the dobby , the house -- coming out of the artist in the work of the work .
this is brilliant -- there it is , there &apos;s the distance that i talked about -- the psychological construct that protect you from the consequences of your work .
and everybody knew that it was working , right ?
the artist &apos;s aging was protected in some ways , like , for example , too much narcissm , right ?
if your work was brilliantly , you didn &apos;t look at it all for you . everybody knew that you had this miserable genius that helped you .
if your work was running -- not entirely your mistakes , right ?
everybody knew your genius was a little bit .
so the people in the west have really thought about creativity .
and then the renaissance and everything changed . we had this big idea , and this big idea was : let &apos;s put the human individual into the center of the universe -- all gods and mystery , and there &apos;s no more room for mystical creatures that are embracing from divine .
it &apos;s the beginning of rational humanism , and people started to believe that creativity was completely from their own individual .
for the first time in history , you hear people call this genius , or one of those artists -- instead of that he has a genius .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
you know ? i think to allow a blog person to think he thinks he or she is like the vessel , like the basin and the essence and the essence and the source of all the divine , infinite mysterious , infinite , infinite , infinite , unfamiliar , to a human psyche .
it &apos;s like asking someone to swallow the sun .
it turns out , and it makes a distorted egos and it creates all these unknowable expectations to success .
i think that this is a success that has neglected our artists over the last 500 years .
and , if that &apos;s true , and i think it &apos;s true -- is the question .
can we change it ?
perhaps an aging understanding of the relationship between people and the mystery of creative return .
maybe not .
maybe we can &apos;t rationalize the thought of 500 years of humanism in a 16-minute talk .
and there are certainly people in this audience who would really get proper scientific doubt about the idea of -- basically -- feen , the people following and on their projects , etc .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey .
but the question i want to throw up is : why not ?
why not think about that ?
because it makes a lot of sense of everything else that i &apos;ve heard about when it was about trying to explain the absolute crazy trouenism of the creative process .
a process that , like everybody knows , has ever tried to do something -- in other words : in fact , everybody here -- not always reasonable .
in fact , he can literally feel parymal .
i had recently met this encounter as i met the extraordinary american diak in ruth stone , which is now about 90 , but her whole life was dilow-cost . she told me that she was going to be working in the basement of virginia . she told me she could feel like a poem about the landscape .
she said it was like an icon of the air .
it would roll on the land .
she felt when it came , because it would bring the earth under her feet .
she knew she was only able to do one in such a moment , and that was -- in her words -- wisconsin race like the devil .
she ran like the devil to the house while she was tracked by this poem , and it was only that she had to get quickly enough to a sheet of paper and a pen so she could do it when she passes through them , and he stuck on the sheet .
in other painting , she was not fast enough . she ran and ran and ran , but she didn &apos;t get the house and the poem led through her , and she said it was going to be over the country , and she said , &quot; rebel after another poet . &quot;
and then there were these moments -- the part i &apos;ll never forget -- she said that there was eye looking at it almost .
so , she goes to the house , and she looks after the paper and the poem goes through her , and she grabs a pen just as it goes through her , and then she said -- she was like , &quot; she was going to pick up with her other hand and put it on . &quot;
she got the poem on his tail , and she pulled it back into her body , and she took it on the sheet of paper .
in these opportunities , the poem came in and intact and intact on paper -- but backwards -- from the last word to the first .
when i heard that , i thought that this is immensely -- that &apos;s exactly what my creative process is .
it &apos;s not like my creative process -- i &apos;m not the channel !
i &apos;m a moulal . to be able to get up at the same time , i have to get up at the same time and blow me up and really get upset .
but even i &apos;ve got this thing in my mouth , sometimes this thing .
and i guess many of you have done that too .
even i had work , or ideas that came from a source of mine that i really couldn &apos;t identify .
what is this thing ?
and how do we deal with it in terms of our minds without losing our minds , but even in the contrary of mental health ?
for me , the best living example of how you can do this is the musician , tom waits . i was allowed to interview him a magazine a few years ago .
we talked about this issue , and you know what ? most of his life was tom &apos;s embodiment of the modern modern artist , trying to get this uncontrolled creative pulse that was in his neighborhood and to deal with them .
but then he got older and quiet . he told me that he went to los angeles a day in los angeles , and then everything changed for him .
he &apos;s driving up with high speed when he suddenly hears a little piece of a tune , which , as an inspections , is often difficult for him , and he wants to do it , and he wants to do it . she &apos;s not going to touch it .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper ; he doesn &apos;t have a pen , he doesn &apos;t have a setar recorder .
so he starts out , this old blob in him , like i &apos;m going to lose this thing , and i &apos;m going to be lost by this song on forever .
i &apos;m not good enough , i &apos;m not making it .
but instead of getting married , he just stopped .
he finished the whole thought , and he did something completely new .
he just looked in the sky , and he said , philanthroough , can &apos;t you see that i drive car ? rebel ?
nate i look like i could just write a song ?
if you really want to exist , come back to a lighter moment , if i care about you .
if not , there &apos;s someone else today .
go and quplleonard cohen .
his whole workprocess has changed .
not the work itself . it was still as dark as ever as ever .
but the process and the hard yield that surrounds him was when he took the genius out of it , where he was doing nothing as trouble and left him back to where he came from . he realized it didn &apos;t have to be an internating , agonizing thing .
it could give you an owners , wonderful , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and the alien , which was not quite tom .
as i heard this story , it also changed a little bit the way i worked and i &apos;ve been saving it .
this idea saved me as i was in the middle of the holocaust process , wisconsin , love , love , and i fell into one of these dives that we all fall in if we work on something and it &apos;s not working . you start thinking that it &apos;s going to be a disaster .
not only bad , but the worst ever time .
i started thinking , i should just put the project up .
but then i remembered how tom had spoken in the free sky and i tried it .
so i took my view from the manuscript and i talked to my comment towards a blank corner of the room .
i was talking loudly , you know , the thing you and i know both when this book is not brilliant , it &apos;s not completely my fault , right ?
because you see i have everything i have , i don &apos;t have any more than that .
so if you want to get it better , you &apos;ve got to check up here and keep your share on it .
okay . but if you don &apos;t do that , you know what , then the hell .
i &apos;ll keep writing on , because that &apos;s my job .
and i want to give you a record that i was here today for my part of the jobs .
because ... at the end of the line , it &apos;s like follows . in centuries of centuries in the deserts of north america , people have gathered into winds with holy dances and music that have been held for hours -- until dawn .
these accomplished were great , because the dancers were professional and they were fantastic .
but again , again , very rare , something special happened . one of the founders was actually passed over .
and i know you know what i mean , because i know you &apos;ve all seen one such performance in your life .
it was as if the time was still standing , and the dancer was coming through a kind of pk . he didn &apos;t do anything different than he had ever done before -- 1,000 nights before .
and all of a sudden , he didn &apos;t get into it anymore anymore .
he was illuminated by the inside , and from the bottom , and everything lit up through a divine fire .
when something happened then , people knew what that was . they called it in his name .
they put the hands together and they started singing : philanthroallah , allah , allah , god , god , god . sandy .
that &apos;s god , you know ?
interesting historical footnote : when the moop southspain brought together , they made this practice . the language changed in the course of the centuries of philanthroallah , allah , alula hypé , olé , olé , olene , olene , which you still listen to , and flenco dances .
if a guy in spain is doing something uncapable , something magical is done : philanthrourlah , olé , olene , al lah , great , brown therapist , there &apos;s a glimpse of god .
and that &apos;s great because we need it .
but the tricky part follows the next morning when the dancer wakes itself and recognizes it &apos;s 11 o &apos;clock on a tuesday -- and he &apos;s no longer a five-eyed of god .
he &apos;s just an aging adult with pain , and maybe he &apos;ll never get back to those heights .
and maybe somebody &apos;s going to name god name , if he turns . but what do he want to do with the rest of his life ?
that &apos;s hard .
this is one of the most painful correctness of a creative life .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be that much of pa if you didn &apos;t believe in the beginning that the most extraordinary aspects of your existence were coming .
if you may just believe that you &apos;re a merame -- from a unimaginable source for a given time of your life that &apos;s passed to somebody else when you &apos;re done with it .
when we start thinking about it , it changes everything .
so i started thinking , and so i think with certainty in the past few months , while i was working on the book , that &apos;s soon going to appear -- as the dangerous , frightening , strong expected of my success .
what i have to say constantly , when i &apos;m going to talk about it , is : no fear .
not disapmusive .
just do your job .
it &apos;s still for your contribution , whatever he wants to be .
if your job is dancing , you dance .
if the dumb divine genius , which is asked to give you the side , decides to show a brief moment of miracles through your effort , then cherolé !
and if not , you dance your dance .
and coucholé ! gaza for all of you .
i believe that , and i feel like we should teach this .
coucholé ! gaza for you despite all of this , just for you to be the mere human love and the self-sense of being there .
thank you .
thank you .
olé !
last year , i showed these two slides to illustrate that the arctic ice caps , which had the size of the bottom three million years of the size in order to 40 percent .
but this doesn &apos;t push enough enough to the seriousness of this particular problem because it shows not the thickness of ice .
in a certain sense , the arctic ice force is the beating heart of our global climate system .
it grows in the winter in the summer .
the next slide i show you is a time-lapse of what happened in the last 25 years .
the permanent ice ice is covered with red .
as you can see , it grows on the darkblue blue . this is the annual ice ice shelf , and it &apos;s shrinking in summer .
what &apos;s called permanent ice , five years old or older , is almost like blood , which is out of the body .
in 25 years , it will be disappeared from here .
this is a problem because warming causes the frozen bottom of the arctic ocean in which there are great amounts of frozen carbon , which , when he gets up , it &apos;s driven by microbes to methane .
compared to the whole amount of climate change in the atmosphere , it could double that amount , if we cross this critical point .
already today , some flat lakes in alaska are methane from itself from the water .
professor katey walter , in alaska , traveled with another group of labor to another flat lake last winter .
wow !
it &apos;s good . the question is , it &apos;s going to be us .
and one reason is , this enormous blade of heat is coming out of the north .
this is a roadwater river .
but the volume are significantly bigger than ever before .
this is the canary suaq river in southern west greenland .
if you want to know what the sea level of sea ice is going to be like , you &apos;re going to go into the sea .
these rivers take rapid .
on the other end of the planet , antarctica , the biggest ice mass on the planet .
last month , researchers decided that the entire continent has a negative ice sheet .
and the west antarctica that showed over a few underwater islands is particularly strong in the melting .
it &apos;s 20 feet of sea height , like greenland .
in the himalayas , the third largest ice mass , you see new lakes that were a few years ago .
40 percent of the people in the world get half of their drink water from this melting water .
in the bahamas , this glacier is the drinking water source for this city .
the amount of water has increased .
but if you run , most of the drinking water will fall away .
in california , there was a 40 percent reduction in the sierra ceiling .
that &apos;s where memory ponds .
and the predictions , as you read them , are serious .
these austrockness in the whole world leads to a dramatic increase .
and the catastrophe all over the world have had a really extraordinary and unprecedented degree of magnitude .
four times as many in the previous 30 years of the previous age .
this is a completely unfair progression .
if you look at this in the historical context , you can see what it does .
in the last five years , we &apos;ve produced 70 million tons of co2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons every day in the oceans .
look at the area of the east pacific , from the american continent western and beidents of the indian subcontinent , where there is a dramatic decline in the ocean .
the biggest one factor for global warming , against deforestation , which is 20 percent , is burning of fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the biggest problem .
the united states is one of the two largest pollutants together with china .
and the proposal was to build a lot of carbon factories .
but we start to see a change .
here are the ones that were reported in the last few years with some green alternatives that were suggested .
there is a political argument in our country .
and the cohleines and shads have spent a quarter billion dollars last year to install clean coal , which is a contradiction in itself .
this picture reminded me of something .
around christmas , i went at home in tennessee , a billion tons of cooking lamb .
they &apos;ve seen it in the news .
this is in our second largest decline from america &apos;s largest waste river .
this was about christmas .
one of the ads of cooking industries around christmas was this .
frosty of the carbon man is a pleasure , happy shark .
it &apos;s in the light and abundance in america , and it helps our economy to grow .
frosty , the hydroman gets clean every day .
he &apos;s affordable and loving , and workers stay in lohn and bread .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
the most powerful mountain worker is the head of massey fluorescent .
let me tell you very clearly . al gore , nancy pelosi , harry reid , you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
so the alliance for climate protection has launched two campaigns in life .
this is one , part of her .
at coalergy , we see climate change as a serious danger for our business .
so we set it to the top time , to spend a significant amount of money to spend a commercial action on the way to the truth of coal .
in fact , coal is not dirty .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it also smells good .
so , don &apos;t worry about the climate change .
give it to us .
dinosaurs , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
so let &apos;s take a tour of this modern , clean coal factory .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty loud .
but it &apos;s the sound of the clean coal technology .
and yet , the coal of coal is one of the main reasons for global warming , which is remarkable carbon technology that you see here changes everything .
look at it , this is the first , clean carbon technology .
finally , the positive alternative among our economic challenges and our challenge of national security .
america is in a crisis that , economy , national security , the climate crisis .
the red thread that all combine this is our dependence , is our carbon dependence , like dirty coal and foreign oil .
but now there &apos;s a bold , new solution to free us out of that domain .
help america with 100 percent clean electricity , within the next 10 years .
a plan , to bring america back to work , make us safer and help to stop the global warming .
finally , a solution that is large enough to solve our problems .
foster america is new . find more out .
this is the last .
it &apos;s about a new service of america .
one of the fastest ways , our dependence of old , dirty power materials that kill our world .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
new investments to create well-paid jobs .
care america . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
there &apos;s an old african saying , &quot; if you want to be quick , go alone .
if you want to get far , together . &quot;
we have to get far , and it &apos;s fast .
thank you .
i want to start by asking you to think about the time of your childhood when you played with a tree .
while they realized how to open their hands and reproduction them , they &apos;re actually learning , and they &apos;re actually learning , they actually learned to think and solve problems through understanding and changing space .
the spatial thinking is very closely connected to how we understand a lot of our environment .
as a computer scientist -- inspired by the kind of interaction with real objects -- with my professional patti and my colleague jeevan kalanithi , i started to wonder , what if we were to use computers that would be moving instead of a mouse in the field of labor ... ...
the question was that we decided to explore the answer to the answer , and sives developed .
in short , an siunderable computer is an interactive computer in the size of a cookie .
you can be moved with your hand , you can perceive each other , you can capture your movements , and you have a screen and a radio .
more importantly , there are physically , why you can only move it like building and access to your hands .
and the siders are an example of a new generation of aid to manipulation digital data .
and if these tools are becoming more physical and conscious for their movements , each other to see each other and the enemies of our trajectory , we can start with the study of new and entertaining interaction .
i start with some simple examples .
this is an escalable for the video reacts , and if i put it in a direction of kib , the video will run forward ; when i go to the other direction , it goes backwards .
and these interactive portraits take each other .
so if i put them side-by-side , they get interest .
if they &apos;re surrounded , they &apos;ll notice that and can be nervous .
and they feel their movements as well .
an interesting consequence of the interactions that we started to recognize was that we could apply knowledge gestures on data like this , like colored color , how to do it with liquids .
in this case , we have three sives as color corfigurization , and i can use them to pour color in the middle of the center , where they &apos;re going to mix .
if we overload it , we can recover a little bit .
there are also some nice ways in education like languages , math or logic games , where we give people the possibility of fast trial and the results immediately .
here i am -- this is a fibonacci series that i do with a simple program .
this is a game with words that &apos;s a kind of mixture of scrabble and boggle .
and basically , you get every round of people in siftable letters , and as you try to form words , they will be tested by a dictionary .
then , after about 30 seconds , after about 30 seconds , again , you get mixed and you have a new array of new possibilities .
thank you .
these are some kids who came on a trip to the media lab , and i could move it to try and take a video of it .
they really loved it .
an interesting thing about this kind of applications is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
everything you have to say is &quot; form words &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
here &apos;s another couple of people test it .
this is our youngest best-right down there .
it turns out he wanted to just stack the sives .
so for him , they were just building .
this is an interactive illusion .
we wanted to develop a tool for language learning .
this is felix .
he can bring new characters into the scene using the siftable of the table that shows this character .
here he leaves the sun .
the sun goes up .
now he takes a tractor into the scene .
the orange tractor .
good work ! yes !
by shaking the siders and you can put them side-by-side , it can interact the characters ...
... his own story invent .
hello !
it &apos;s a story with open end and it can decide how to evolve .
flying cat .
the last example that i have spent time to show it , is a musical sequence on live performances that we &apos;ve recently developed , and in the sidden as sound , as a leadership , bass and batstuff .
each one has four different variations ; you can choose which you want to use .
and you can pull those sounds into the sequence that you can turn into any patterns .
and you store them by simply holding a sound to a contractive contractor .
there are effects that you can change live , like hall and filters .
you connect it to a specific note , and then it tends to hire it .
and then even more conservative effects like speed and volume that you use on the entire sequence .
so let &apos;s see .
we start in the process of the leadership in two sequencing screens , and that in a row , they expand and add a little bit more of the voice .
now i add a bass .
now i &apos;m going to do something about it .
and now i &apos;m pushing the filter with the stuff that i can control the effect of live .
i can accelerate the entire sequence by turning the pace into one or another direction .
and now i &apos;m using the filter with the bass , for something more expression .
i can go through the sequence as it &apos;s happening .
so i don &apos;t have to plan them in the forefield , but it can improvise ; they &apos;re expanding , and they &apos;re extending .
and finally , i can end up with the whole sequence by showing the sound to the left .
thank you .
so as you can see , my excitement is to develop new human-computer models that make better than how our brains and bodies work .
and today i had time to give you a part of this new design world and some of the possibilities of what we &apos;re working on in our lab .
the idea that i want to leave you with is that we are at the threshold of this new generation of value to digital media , which brings information into our world , which is our demands .
thank you .
i &apos;m looking at the conversations with you all !
yeah , good afternoon .
i &apos;m glad i &apos;m there .
yeah , so what is biohacking ?
i just have to take a little bit of time , and it &apos;s biohacking with modern molecular biology .
i &apos;ve been studying molecular biology , and i &apos;ve been doing this for a couple of years now with the biohacking , and i started , because i just wanted to know , and i wanted to do it , especially , what i learned in studying .
so , that was my primary motivation .
so it was a curiosity , and i kind of wanted to get closer to the matter .
i think that molecular biology is generally , so very generally speaking , biotechnology , everything you count , synthetic biology and so on .
extremely important , now is extremely important , and much more important will become in the future .
there are so delicate things that changed all the genetic plants on the branches .
now there &apos;s craig venter in the united states , which is trying to make biofuel , so gas dioxide .
there &apos;s also some things that are totally in the day-to-day world , which is most people who are not aware of it , for example , the laundry enzymes that allow us to wash with four degrees of laundry , are also genetically tested enzymes .
and the list can go ahead .
and so from the interest in this technology , i &apos;ve just moved on to this technology .
so , why is it hacking ?
most people know what most people are familiar with .
computers hack , and then it &apos;s always going to break into the media , yes , the hackers somewhere and claws and so on .
this is kind of really sad for the hackerscene , because it doesn &apos;t really mean what it actually did , and what actually is behind .
and that is , the software hacker , in the seventh ties , started with computer activity , and it came out of the internet .
and it &apos;s about solving a playful , creative , original way of solving a problem .
and problem , it &apos;s not just a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can also be a one-to-one problem , which kind of simplify things , so any problem-solving , a question , and how you can make it better .
and it has just been done with software , but it &apos;s also in the electric field , because there &apos;s also a whole construction scene that &apos;s going to do all kinds of things that are going to do all kinds of things .
and now , in perspective , in biology , and this is where i want to take this metaphor that &apos;s coming out of synthetic biology , that biology is actually a science of information because , the d.n.a code is a abstract code , which is an abstract code , which is not just the same as computers , because it &apos;s matter , because it &apos;s matter , so real matter , because it &apos;s the matter of it , because it &apos;s so dynamic , because it &apos;s more dynamic , because it &apos;s
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can also program it , and you can also hack it , and that &apos;s what i found incredibly fascinating , and i just wanted to get a lot deeper .
and that &apos;s really only taken two and a half eight , really , accepted these networks .
there &apos;s hackers dot dot , which is originally from switzerland , which is , in fact , in europe and with cooperation in india , but now members of people around the world have been around .
this is a more artistic alignment , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers and in collaboration with scientists with scientists , just with these technologies , and asking questions about these technologies , and to process creative , because there &apos;s museum exhibitions and yes .
but in fact , it &apos;s always about finding such a closecloser access , such a playful to have to have .
and then there &apos;s humility organic dot , d.i.y.bio-.
this is from the united states a network , which is actually more like this kind of forum where you &apos;re going to go and discuss and discuss online .
they &apos;re a little bit more technical , and a little bit of business on the road , then they &apos;ll be asked , yes .
and based on these networks that have made the whole popular thing , has evolved such a scene that i &apos;d like to stress .
here in the picture on the upper left , you see biofighters , that &apos;s a hackerspace , so basically a kind of school , a private school , a nonprofit , where everybody can come .
children , old , all kinds of people are going to go to it just so that they have a lab , and they have a lab and look at what can be done when they &apos;re doing this lab .
the bottom on the left is a group in indonesia called houque kites , which is , but it &apos;s quite a long time .
for longer than those other two networks .
it also acts in such an artistic aspect of biological materials and , yes , electronics of electronics , and they combine it in pretty much way .
a group of ankara that i met before a while ago , which is a student group , who would like to convey the public more , which is what they learn in college , and they &apos;ve been trying to explain what they &apos;re learning , and they &apos;ve been trying to explain what d.n.a is .
and i have a lecture on the top of the other picture in copenhagen in the medical museum in a combination of an exhibition .
and this is , yes , that &apos;s usually right young people , but the only thing which is actually united , is this fascination in technology .
and what you can do with it , and you can do it very specifically on society and to ask , so , okay , what do you want , what do you want to participate with ?
so , in order to hack biology , you kind of need some material .
you need , of course , biological materials , and you also need tools , and that &apos;s a lab .
and in fact , what you normally understand under a lab , that &apos;s kind of annoying machines , extremely expensive , extremely expensive , only for professionals , educated academics and so on .
and our approach was to say , unick , that actually you don &apos;t have to do that .
this is actually not necessary , because every every coffee virus has actually developed technology as most of the lab works , that &apos;s really like that .
and s with this premise with this premise then , for example , of brian degger in england tried to provide a minimal abor , then took a steam plate , a heat plate , and , you know , they banned bacteria .
so every one of the things that a soup is named is that he &apos;s left too long , even before .
i then tried to do this in my lab , a little bit , and then i &apos;ve got to buy so plases of equipment on ebay and made a little bit of the d.n.a analysis , trying to figure out a dad , so this is the case at home .
this is actually not supposed to be a joke now , but .
here , in the picture , you see the lab , in anstriils , so it &apos;s such an jete garage with all sorts of lab , and that &apos;s a little bit of a mess that has gone to college , a group in paris , which is what it has , and pretty interesting things , i want to do a little bit of interesting stuff .
and this is biosandy , which also mentioned hackerspace , this one , sort of a kind of folk school in principle for molecular biology .
and yes , you know , you see , it &apos;s relatively relatively heterogenic , so there &apos;s a lot of people who are doing this in their own home until so much larger organizations who carry the more explicit form in institutional form .
but always , always the approach that it &apos;s supposed to be simple and accessible .
the first project that we &apos;ve done as an international group , as we &apos;re sort of aware of ourselves , is now , we &apos;re now here as a real scene , and we &apos;re online , and we &apos;re so familiar with people who are always sitting there .
and then , from the do-it-yourself organic , the founder of the founder , and said , &quot; well , we &apos;ve got to really meet ourselves now , even real meetings , and then organized two events , in london , two thousand and a half , in san francisco .
and then , it was also about , yes , who are we , what are we going to do , what do we want to say ?
and what are our values , what are our values , what is our goal ?
and then we &apos;ve been working on a cocogeny synthesizer .
this was quite intuitive , so everyone has just got his wishes , his and what he &apos;s going to do , say , &quot; then .
and , in my opinion , i came up with a very good code .
and then we have , you know , we &apos;re not conpathetic , but that &apos;s , you know , i think it &apos;s pretty good , i think , quite well , that people are right there .
and we even tried to bring that back into the academic world , but there &apos;s kind of no way that it arrived .
so i think we &apos;re in the process of biohacking in the way that the academic world .
now , what about projects we do now ?
a project that i did with the manteria network in switzerland itself was that we wanted to do something called an optical accident or an optical brush .
this is , if you focus a laser beam on one in the room , then you can capture little particles in the air or in the liquid , and then move in that focus , so , you know , it &apos;s captured like such a tractor officer principle .
this works really , it &apos;s done in the academic directors , and then we thought , you know , we might have , you know , maybe we have a webcam , that we might be able to do , then we have a webcam , which is the lens , then you have a microscope that goes out about four and a half times .
this is what you see down there .
and then we went apart a d.v.d burning , and then the burning sends out the laser and then tries to focus on this camera .
and unfortunately , it didn &apos;t work , but we &apos;ve yet learned a lot .
so another project that comes from the french group in paris , which has worked , that &apos;s pretty cool .
and this is a kind of a brain wave device , so it &apos;s such a brain wave , so e.e.g or something , so he &apos;s dealing with neurobiology , his reputation name is sam neurohack .
he then turned this to this helmet there , and in cooperation with the museum , it ran .
and then the visitors could go into the room , sit on this chair , sit on this helmet .
then their brain waves measured , and depending on what they thought or how they thought , is then different lights in the room .
it was a pretty nice project .
another thing from the united states , which also has to do with this dad &apos;s story , is that the p.c.r , which is the polymerase-bank reaction , complicated word .
so it &apos;s about copying genes , to reproduce , to reproduce , to reproduce , to reproduce , so that you can make it visible .
so , if i do that , the profiler at the center of the crime , then go , collect any hair samples , and then those apply this method , and then they can say , &quot; you know , this hair is listening to this person . &quot;
and the machines that are doing something like that , they &apos;re pretty expensive that you buy , the cheapest to go to four thousand euros .
and that &apos;s not in the hobbysection , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that can also do a lot .
so that &apos;s just a kind of application that you can do with it .
and they &apos;ve taken two of these two builders , and they said , &quot; nak , that &apos;s what we do easier and cheaper , and then just open open source , so freely open hardware , electric stuff , and that &apos;s the cheapest venit of these devices .
i think somehow six or something like that .
but anyway , it &apos;s still not cheap yet , but it &apos;s definitely definitely in a frame of where it &apos;s going to be clear .
so , i think it &apos;s a very common hack .
a project i had recently begun to build was a gene-gun gun .
gene gun is , yeah , like a kind of air pressure that shoots about the same , two centimeters or something .
you charge ran.a on gold particles , and the gold particles , and then i put it on the air pressure , and then i &apos;d put the lights on , and then put it into it .
so the device you see , that doesn &apos;t work .
but this is my prototype , but it &apos;s kind of looked down to me , so on a branch of a branch , the thing on it , electronics and pressure , and that was the pressure that was left .
and then i took one of the guns and i put it on this .
a saimese , if you get the full power of water , it &apos;s got enough pressure , so i think so four to six .
and then you can accelerate the particles very long , and then you go into the onion .
and the commercial device costs about five thousand dollars upstairs or something like that , saimese pender .
so it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically feasible .
so that &apos;s the moment that this is actually the core of the scene , to raise these availability of technology and also increase the information and the ability to increase that more people can get involved .
because , as i said at the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have pretty little idea of it and also no chance to make themselves good .
because if you just read about it , the literature is not the same as if you &apos;ve done it yourself or you &apos;ve seen it .
and i think technology is always becoming more important in our modern societies .
and if you want to be able to make an informed citizen choices in society , and you want to talk to them , then you need access to knowledge and technology .
and you also have to do it and understand it and understand it .
and then there &apos;s open therapist and citizen science .
so you just think , as citizens , you &apos;re going to be able to get away with these scientific technologies .
and this is the core of the biohacker .
these are the people who are at least officially adopted on the website , d.i.y.bio-dotcom website .
this is a relatively remarkable number of people worldwide .
and what &apos;s interesting also is they &apos;re also in southeast asia .
i think that &apos;s where there are fewer people there than actually exist .
so i know some who don &apos;t have it .
and these are just the biohackers that individual people .
in part , with these hackerspaces , there are these places in there .
and that &apos;s really the beginning .
as i said , two of them have begun .
and hackerspaces , the computer hackerspace , because the c-base in berlin was the first nine hundred thirths .
and that &apos;s now a gigantic network of very good , yes , infrastructural centers , which are all over the world .
and we hope , of course , that we think we &apos;re going to be similar to it , and then we &apos;re very well connected , so that even more people can be involved in it .
and i would invite everybody to engage with it and even wonder what to try .
it &apos;s not so simple now , but it &apos;s not impossible , if you have enough curiosity , and there &apos;s enough energy in it , you &apos;ll also get there .
thank you for listening .
that &apos;s it .
yes , hello .
how do we actually work ?
this is a question that drives me very much as a designer , but also in the research sector in the research sector , and all of the things in the field of user expertise .
it &apos;s about how to look at people in interactive media so that they can use these interactive media and generate them a very satisfying experience .
and i think that the interactive media is in the archaic , cognitive models , so thinking patterns that have been programmed in our biological memory very , very long time , and that we can actually rearrange that through interactive media .
and this is very amazing because you actually think that this high-technology , which you &apos;ve seen , that actually brings you to the future , but in fact it &apos;s so that the future is right with us , in our archaan roots .
now , what are archaic models ?
i &apos;ve been reading four words , and i &apos;d like to explain quickly .
to archaic cognitive models , which is the models that we &apos;ve done in the pre-industrial times .
to these archaan models , we &apos;ve heard that we have a natural relationship with virtual relationship .
this is basically what sounds unusual .
but i &apos;m going to go back to that , and i &apos;m going to show you by trying to prove that you also have natural relationship with virtual importance .
the second aspect is that since of these archaan models , we &apos;re actually able to talk very , very quickly , even though we &apos;re using a coding language .
and the third area that explains actually itself .
we all know that the interactive media by definition are non-linear , which includes the terminity of the linearity , and of course , tells us we feel the linearity today .
the fourth thing is that the story for us is a place of information .
it &apos;s now with the virtual activity that is actually the most natural thing in the world .
i want to show you that .
how many doors have the house in which they live ?
that &apos;s what we &apos;re not going to be able to answer to them immediately , but it &apos;s going to happen right now .
they go in the spirit of this house , in order to live , and look at how many doors there are .
and that &apos;s what they do .
it &apos;s virtual reality , and it &apos;s a virtual reality .
fantastic , right ?
and then we &apos;re interested in the media campus for example , the virtual reality in our v.r.-lab , we can actually do that all the time .
and this wealth of the virtual to virtual reality , which have had the people in the pre-industrial times , because they didn &apos;t have anything .
they didn &apos;t have books .
or they didn &apos;t have any photoligraphy .
they had no mass media .
the only thing that they had was her head .
and in this head , the memory was down .
in this head , you started to know , and through this virtual images , the imagination was also passed on .
and so it &apos;s so strong in us that we can deal with the virtual activity so well .
the interesting thing about this is if i can make a little trip .
yeah , this is .
the interesting thing about this is that at the same time , the human producers and medium itself was .
now , if you think about it a little bit .
what are media today ?
then you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s a change .
but i &apos;ll talk about that again .
critical tool of information education has been since jeff stories .
shaans , priever , the priests , the field of knowledge , were added for extra to keep knowledge in stories .
and also today , we &apos;re very , very strong at stories .
the author of the book the therapist &apos;s author , jonathan gods , all of us , we still had a hundred hundred hours a year with the prescription of stories .
that means for a child that has to be used to reach the most part of the establishment of the great occupation of life .
now we think , our love of stories depends on having a child on our parents &apos;s lap .
no , no , no .
it goes back much further , in the cultures of pre-industrial times .
but for me , in the realm of interactive media , as special as it is , we face ourselves in our biological memory , the ability to think nonlinear .
i brought you an example of the north african tribe of the nootka-indian tribe .
and life was living in the coastal region of british columbia .
and as you can see , this is a very island area , and you had to kind of navigate there , from island to island to get food .
and they did this with something called lead-land maps .
you may know that if you care a little bit about it , the australian urman .
they have similar principles .
they have no lead-land maps , but they &apos;ve used it so that they use it , and they use mnanmatic protests .
and what the interesting thing about this is that the navigation and the topography of regions could be copied over songs .
with the language of the language , the language was underminded .
this is , you navicated navigating about sound and rhythm .
and these sounds and this rhythm have the geology , which shows the topography of a region , and , of course , also allowed that you could get these songs and put it differently and go back to the left , and back to the site and back to the emergence of the site .
why don &apos;t we sing more to get from the top to b ?
anyway , not to navigate .
what &apos;s actually happened ?
this is why it &apos;s so gennante machine age .
we &apos;ve moved to something called the vogt age .
this is a machine age , and it &apos;s happened , and it &apos;s happened , and it &apos;s the phototography .
and that &apos;s exactly what happened to us that we have responsibility for our memories and the own production of our individual memories , external media .
on the book , and on the picture .
so unfortunately , we have a piece of freedom to virtual .
virtuality suddenly has become alien for us , and has nothing to do with reality .
bruce brown , a famous design researcher at brighton university , has gone so far to say that these mass media , he says the book , and the image , the internet , the internet , etc . , and so on , what we &apos;re describing as a mass media , is that these are mass media of our memories .
let &apos;s do a little thing .
from the vogt era to the machine era .
what has influence on our thinking and our memories ?
then that &apos;s the informed consent of the pre-industrial cultures .
and they &apos;re going to be more and more covered in the centuries of the centuries of the machine .
that is , instead of remembering us , we have standardized , widespread , widespread patterns of memories that we can relate to .
we don &apos;t produce any more ourselves .
we have a abstract abstract language .
we don &apos;t think of the thing anymore in images that don &apos;t anymore , but we &apos;re coding them to our language .
we used to think that things happen linear .
and we have the linearity as law , and there are only exceptions , like the non-linearity .
what &apos;s left is the doodle .
still , we are very , very constrained by the doodle of information .
the question is , what &apos;s going on now ?
we had the age of the age , we had the machine age , and we &apos;re going to describe this so-called cyber age .
it sounds very broad , and it sounds very common fiction , i know .
but these dinosaurs of the cyber age , which brings us to these opportunities again to rediscover our capabilities .
it &apos;s about virtual , it &apos;s about non-linearity , it &apos;s about wisconsin .
i just want to explain a little bit about that .
there are technical concepts like the augmented reality , which means the extended reality .
so if you look at google therapist for example , then this is a concept that allows us to combine the virtual world with the real world , which means our fears to become virtual , to feel the virtual natural , to come back .
another example is the so-called virtual reality .
so , of course , in the context of my speaking of talk , we may be able to move physically not existing , virtual worlds , by the role of the whiskey .
and another example is the most ambitious , intelligent systems .
these are rooms that can respond to a human being .
all of this needs the ability to accept our basic ability to make virtuality as a real habitat .
i graduated in , and i hope the video works , a very , very beautiful project brought , which is a bachelorwork of michael burk , joris in krine , joris lauf .
and the two of them are also here today .
maybe you can stand up , so you can go up and talk to the two of the project .
and i brought this project as an example , as again , in this archaan , cognitive models .
the whole thing is , i have to say .
so , of course , what the doodle is all about , and it &apos;s a computer game .
and if i say computer play , they have very likely to have some people in front of some people around each other , or that they &apos;re playing with some of the same consoles in the hand .
anyway , they do that .
this is a game for the outside .
and that &apos;s determined to think that i discover the outside world outside , so i discover the real world again .
and this game connects the virtual world , so the data is the data that we produce with the real world .
i apologize that i have to cut so much .
you can explain a lot better , there &apos;s a lot more there .
and that &apos;s what i &apos;m about to discover a city by looking at what was positive or negative .
and so i get a very different view of the city , a very different impression , i see negative and positive zones of a city , and i get this kind of a different , virtual map of a very real city .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re like to look at now .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is another little explanation of what you &apos;re seeing .
of course , this virtual world , in the walls of our cities , is clear .
and with a kind of polight , we can make this virtual worlds visible .
so , what i like to do is to summarize my talk , and in the sense that the properties and abilities that we &apos;ve acquired from the age age , and we have a little bit of a little bit of time in the machine that will be activated with the aid of the so-called cyber age , and the way that we &apos;re going to go back to our roots .
thank you .
yeah , i &apos;m very happy to be with you .
i &apos;ve just been asked whether this bag is a speaker bag , and i &apos;m going to talk to you .
it &apos;s not going to do it .
i &apos;m also going to disforce what &apos;s in there .
but so far , i &apos;m just curious about it .
yes , kids are inherently curious , or should be curious , designers .
i &apos;m from house , so , of course , i &apos;m involved in the subject of curiosity and how it changes the curiosity again , and why are we going to lose curiosity , and why are we going to do curiosity ?
this is a whole set of things that you &apos;re dealing with next to the actual existence .
when professors are curious , they &apos;re often thrown into this research package .
and that &apos;s what i had over the last half-year .
a research semester for natural trafficking interface design .
now , they &apos;re going to be wondering , why are they going to start with such natural , archaic urforms of communication , interaction and so on .
and i just think of one of these little devices , because things are supposed to be more intuitive , always natural , more natural , more natural , and then you have to look at what &apos;s actually natural for us , of course .
and before the background , i was in the field of natural user interface design , so the next generation in human computers in the relationship with human computers in the relationship with how our tools or how the computer works from the machines to the digital assistant .
so i &apos;ve been working on this , of course , where or intuitively .
maybe a look at this .
why does that happen ?
so if we look at the development of our society , this is a short statement , then we now move from the third to the fourth generation or social form .
so from modern in the computer company .
every society is shaped by a primary medium .
at the beginning , the tribal society through the language .
that is , you &apos;ve found that you &apos;ve talked to a common language , you could communicate with each other , and it &apos;s moved into the same cave , or in other areas , cities , or villages , has created , kind of , created tribal society .
but the primary medium was the language , something very natural , something very natural .
you &apos;ve also had to learn , so no little kid can talk about nature , but we &apos;re learning it , naturally , of course .
it was then forced by the ancient society and the first form of abstraction .
this was a big scream , because , of course , you &apos;ve started to manifest the living language in the form of writing , which is what , what liquid and alive is , i start and put it in stone and i do it .
depending on how i shoot and when i &apos;m standing , of course , it &apos;s a very different narrative when it &apos;s kind of alive .
but sukzonal then moved this script as a primary medium .
and then the next generation , in which we actually still have primary life .
this is just by pressure and print writing with guberg and others .
at the time , it was just an affront where adel , and other people have said : are you actually insane when people start reading , then they want to talk to you , and that &apos;s completely fatal .
and now we &apos;re going to go into the next generation and the exciting thing is that a generative shift is just a few hundred years , and we &apos;re really right now in this phenomenal phase that we &apos;re doing this .
the confused us of course , because we look at one side of the new media , social media , social media , facebook and so on .
with the total transparency , what the new thinking is , what makes you think of the old thinking , don &apos;t say that in the laser horse meat and no more beef or other phenomena , i want to just do that .
and these two worlds are all right together , new and old thinking .
the exciting thing is , if you look at this , these new society , this computer society , is very remote , very many mechanisms , principles and archaic paradigm out of the tribal society .
but no longer at the local level , but on global level .
we understood that the weather is global .
that the theme of ecology is a global .
not when i think of locally , and the neighbor thinks less ecoloms , then it doesn &apos;t work .
that is , from local village , it has become a global village with the same principles , of course , of course , but the total transparency .
as you knew at the time in the village , who has what , who and when , this is what happens today on this expansion of ourselves through these mobile devices .
it &apos;s that we know global clusters and faster and faster and better .
that &apos;s how it used to happen to the village .
in front of the background , i &apos;ve just been looking at what &apos;s going on , which is , of course , what &apos;s left for us , which is what we might also have , but also instinctively , what makes the difference ?
because that &apos;s because often people are , you can &apos;t use it friendly , so everyone can handle it .
so you have to deal with what &apos;s called , and not only can it change it , but it &apos;s going to be better .
and when is , of course , a little bit intuitive , and how i can make an impact on it , and just make things like this , that they &apos;re a uses of use , so they &apos;re very intuitive , because they &apos;re going to make fun and just use .
you &apos;re going to be engaged in the course of the study , with the subject of perception and the perceptual constraints .
and that &apos;s , of course , where you start and look and look and say , okay , now i just look in the inner self .
and what does it look like in there ?
so how do we work when we look inside ?
and what does it mean , of course , intuitively and how does our channels work and how does the cognitive processing work ?
because steve jobs said , well , you have to diagnose therapist to diagnose it .
so you really have to look at the details if i want to do something friendly or intuitive , which is called the core .
and you can see that you have a our seven senses , most people think we have only five , we &apos;ve already realized about seven , because it certainly comes out in the near future , it certainly comes next to the next eighth , and as an extension of our self .
and looking at how we process information , how do we take information ?
to say , what &apos;s information alone ?
information is all different , which is a difference .
a lot of people use the word , but don &apos;t even know what it means .
but i have to understand in the core , in the creatures understand when will information become information , when it comes from data , and from information to information , so i know how to make things more intuitive , of course .
and , of course , design impact on perception .
we see this when i turn things out , then i can confuse them like the right , where i don &apos;t know what &apos;s salt and pepper , or i can make them kind of intuitive by showing things .
so a lot of natural , it &apos;s in a high school , but i kind of look directly at where &apos;s salt and pepper .
and if i tell somebody , you give me salt or pepper , then he &apos;s going to be thinking about where &apos;s in there .
and the one on the left just gets intuitive and i hope that no sugar is in the middle of it .
but also our perception of itself , as it turns on .
for example , these perception in context .
the right circle looks taller than the little , even though it &apos;s not the case , but they &apos;re equally big , and yet our perception , depending on what context we put in things .
anybody know what that is ?
come on .
ambulance is supposed to work .
that &apos;s where it &apos;s going to be to my glasses .
so it &apos;s the circle .
a second circle already begins to correlate certain similarity or associate .
and then , if i take a half a second , we &apos;re not going to see a unit of a unit , which is the circle , circle and , but we see a unit , we don &apos;t see three parts , a circle , a circle , a different circle .
so , this is what &apos;s called a built-in law or a specific psychology that affects us in perception .
it &apos;s important for the payage , the most part of the first semester , the great set of law .
law laws close , law law and so on .
i often forget in third .
but this is a food essential component , if you want to design things very intuitively .
the next phenomenon , which is very interesting , is the vision of vision .
it sounds very banal , but it &apos;s very exciting when you get closer to it .
so we have the eyes on the front , and now you think we &apos;re looking at the back .
that &apos;s wrong .
you &apos;re looking at the back of the back .
because they project an assumption for the front that they see something that they recognize , unprecedented circle .
that is , we &apos;re just seeing our first vision before we see it , and then bring back back to the back in our souc device to say , okay .
i have this cognitive retreat , you have what you want to see .
that &apos;s where it &apos;s then coming back .
then again , it goes back to the front because the back of the back is not in the front and says , you know , right now , please look again , and sure that you &apos;re looking at what you &apos;re looking at .
and then it goes back to the back and then it &apos;s actually going to be seen .
so , a very , very exciting process , like certain things , and what &apos;s happening for milliseconds , these things happen .
i don &apos;t know who familiar with you this picture .
that &apos;s what i &apos;ve just described the same thing .
now , everybody &apos;s trying to see something from this pattern .
i don &apos;t know who sees what .
does anybody see something particular ?
a dalmatiner , right .
once i &apos;ve seen that , that there &apos;s a therapist in there , then you know that .
you never forget about it , because i &apos;m going to show you where the funders is .
now look at the dalmatiner .
and further , look at it .
that means , i &apos;m actually going to get you away now that you don &apos;t see no more patterns in it , but i created it in a short time , again , to see this dog in this picture .
and this is the projection of vision , back feedback .
now i &apos;m looking at it and now i &apos;m talking to you that i see the dalmatiner .
i see the dalmatiner .
so , quite exciting processes that then , in this one , yeah , gray is actually not , but here in this roilen mass , it &apos;s very accurate .
anybody know what three seconds are ?
long , yes .
that &apos;s our present .
so , it &apos;s also interesting to know as designers .
if i know something about three seconds , until i kind of kind of like the present to the present loop , i can also make a very good wait for a while that i can do with someone with three seconds .
it has to process the present .
and then it goes into the past , and so i can bridge a very elegant wait for example at the computer , if i know this phenomenon .
what takes five and 20 milligrams ?
yes , milliseconds .
a very exciting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the time where you &apos;re in love .
that means warning , if you know that now , pay attention to who you look like long , because i don &apos;t take any elected , what can happen then .
and six milliseconds , also a very exciting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the time of most perception that we have .
that is , this first impression happens in a rapid fast speed , as we perceive things .
and as we see things , what we &apos;re looking at , and how we &apos;re sort of predicting ourselves against our environment , so we can think about it .
now , of course , the scage is not just about the issue of perceptions and neural processing or cognition , but primary , of course , with the subject of humanity &apos;s relationship .
so it &apos;s a person with certain things .
there &apos;s a product of language that is practical , so as formulas aspects or formally aesthetic aspects .
you know , there are objectives , where i know exactly where i have to get .
but there &apos;s also symbolic functions , why is there anybody for such a small , where anyway , no matter what &apos;s going on , so horror sums of money , even though it &apos;s not that practical ?
we &apos;re more likely to be on the symbolic , on the average level , with which we are , of course , too .
back to my real topic of natural user interface , and the theme of which , of course , is ustherapist .
uskeeper always means how i can achieve a certain goal , or how can a user in a certain respect be effectively effective , efficient and conscious to a goal .
that &apos;s what the norm says .
how can i make a good kind of leverage ?
i can use that directly or i need to do it , or i need to do it , or i &apos;ll do it .
and less philanthroned or aid is it .
i &apos;m just making this different and beautiful , meaning that it &apos;s better .
you have to understand that .
and then , in part , if you look at the software that we &apos;ve just seen , you &apos;re going to understand why ninety-nine percent of our current software is very intuitively , or not on anacb , which is an alarming pad in many different ways , even though it &apos;s more intuitive than classical software .
so , intuitive use is not just a fundamental economic factor , which is the most important factor of success , if i want to use technological devices for people .
why ?
because in the rule of this new kind of utility , the natural user settlement , for example , are five times faster than our goal .
you &apos;ve got to imagine that if you do something of the classical stuff , five hours and this new kind of natural software is just an hour .
it doesn &apos;t mean that you probably can probably go home for four hours , but your employer , or somebody , you &apos;ve got one of them , you know , how to deal with the four hours .
but i want to say that for us , of course , it &apos;s an equivalent increase for us to make certain things .
so once we go back into the realm of software , here &apos;s the first offshore line of interfaces that were very abstract where you needed months to deal with these systems .
and then the next one that came up with right now is the neural model , or mental model like the software eergonics , which is , you have an idea of something that is metaphor of a desktop to use the metaphor .
so no longer zeros and ones , or sautic codes , but a metaphor .
so that made the whole amount of user , but it &apos;s also a lot better .
the next generation of the graphic user process works very much with behavior .
so i &apos;m very much more likely to make the behavior that looks like this .
it &apos;s also a paradigm shift .
i think that &apos;s always an unimportant thing to look at the success of the success , just the reformers .
and then , if i take a step further into this natural user user user , where i &apos;m talking about voice , by language , per touch , by gesture , and no longer to drive the things , then i &apos;m even faster and more close .
but the thing that leads me to the point is , when will things actually become intuitive ?
if you become more intuitive and then i have to put my little friend up here and see what does that mean from the picture of cognition , where is it really intuitive now ?
and this is always a slightly intuitive thing for us to do when i have to think very little about it .
so he doesn &apos;t seem like to think about it , but it just makes it matter .
the less i think about it , the more intuitive it is .
and what does that mean for designers ?
that means that if we can see that we can transmit existing action models of one on something else , like the metaphor , then i can do that as a phrase .
that means that i can transmit such an intuitive , human activity model on software and make the software much more useful .
so , of course , the question is , what &apos;s the most intuitive thing to do with human beings and now i &apos;ve already talked about it .
this is what creationy model is .
it uses every one of us and ozone is an acronym , and it stands for reflections , selective , informed , transcompass .
it makes each of you all the time , but it makes it consciously and it &apos;s kind of intuitive , or partly instinctively .
the model is going to be in the womb , and it &apos;s intercultural , so it works in young and old , and it &apos;s being used by us all the time , without most people knew that this model is there .
it &apos;s about 50 to seven thousand thousand years of each of us ever , so , in the sleep , you have noticed that it &apos;s going to be less common than the day .
now , i can engineer this mental model , selective , informed , transcompass , depending on interaction systems .
and through that kind of transmission , like the metaphor of the airplane , now no longer a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of an action , a handconducting .
and this is on a higher graver of the user kindness as the transmission of a classic metaphor , which is the vehicle .
and if i &apos;m wearing that now , for example , i &apos;m more engaged than overview , selects as a choice , evidence in which the trap , it comes large to me , i can look at it in the details , and , yes , i can go and buy it .
then i can transmit the whole thing .
i &apos;m trying to do this by an unprecedented .
now , everybody ate pies .
overview : now i kind of interact with the object , again , zoom out .
i get rid of all the way , and i can now say , show me all the things with chocolate for example .
and at once a interface , which is significantly more intuitive and very much natural .
because , you know , i can grab things like the bits , touch , and they come to me , is significantly natural than when the hierarchy of hierarchically organized websites can make these things accessible .
imagination is more therapist therapist , and with that sentence i also like to close , a and again to give the impression , designers have to think differently to come to new solutions , and in this sense , i thank you very heart .
i want to help you a particular aspect of curiosity .
the first , if you &apos;re a child , as a baby , is that you care about your drum , which is what you have , right ? and depending on whether your parents have allowed them to play more or less , the more that their curiosity is , of course , of course .
and the curiosity is not learning .
that &apos;s why everybody is here , and they &apos;re curious , in fact , people who have a property you can &apos;t learn .
i &apos;m going to do it now , basically , this whole environmental discussion , world marrow , four years of clubette , in quality .
and there &apos;s a central point .
and it depends on phosphorus .
give a chance .
every day they give you a + level of magnitude of phosphorus , and every day you have to take two grams of phosphorus .
otherwise you can &apos;t have teeth .
you can &apos;t store energy .
you can &apos;t have bone .
we could only be up as an alarm neollus through the world &apos;s oceans .
if we actually didn &apos;t take phosphorus and give it a phosphorus .
amazingly , it &apos;s like we &apos;re doing something here with something that would actually be self-evident , but not that much .
because everybody talks about energy , but nobody talks about the phosphorus problem .
the phosphorus problem is much more critical .
we depend on two countries .
we only have for two years of phosphorus and now , through the world &apos;s phosphorus mining , much more uranium in the environment than it &apos;s used in all the atomic plants .
in the last 20 years alone , five thousand tons have been distributed on our fields in germany .
and that &apos;s what we take .
it &apos;s doing leukemia with kids .
and we think we would protect the environment if we &apos;re a little less harmful .
so , for example , the environment , it drives less car .
the environment , make less waste .
the environment , they need less energy .
but that &apos;s not protection .
this is what i would say when i say your child , it just throws three times rather than five .
that &apos;s just a little bit less destruction .
if we think about it from the pandemic to the bug , our whole world is used to be a peaceful farm later or later .
that &apos;s why to think about it .
and the most important thing is to look at the ground as the first one .
in the ground , over six percent of carbon dioxide is saved .
right now , we &apos;re building corn and losing between 11 and 30 kilograms of 30 tons per hectare , or on the square meter .
that means we &apos;re losing in the ground for about five and a half years ago .
so , of course , we can first look at the problem problem .
and all of it is packaging or content .
in open stream , for example , the house is 20 percent of the waste of garbage .
and because we get older , the wind will be bigger .
this is what they &apos;re all in the pre-wind phase .
yes ?
a baby takes about six and a half wind wind .
of course , we could reduce that for 10 percent , but what does that do ?
this is being balanced in china in a second .
this is completely trivial .
so the question is , how do we deal with these winds ?
here &apos;s the evidence of the fact that men are not pigs .
i want to tell you .
because the phosphorus is emitted in the pigs of the solid ingredients .
people over the urine .
yeah .
so men can &apos;t be pigs .
because that &apos;s what happened , right ?
traditionally we think in the environmental debate , we &apos;re too many on the world .
and when you talk to people , if you &apos;re talking to people , if you say it &apos;s better , you &apos;re not going to be there , you &apos;re not going to get bored and hostient .
and so someone like al gore says , one of our great heroes , there &apos;s nothing more important than stabilize the human population .
in israel , if you &apos;re saving life , you &apos;re saving the earth .
here it says , the more you move , the better .
yeah .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
if you look at the ants , the weight of the ants on earth , they weigh about four more than we humans .
i could also take termites , but in the united states , nobody like termites , in so far , even though they &apos;re vegetarians .
that means the ants weigh much more than we do .
and because they &apos;re physically working much harder than we and because they live only three to six months , they are in their weight , in energy energy consumption .
that means we &apos;re not too much too stupid , right ?
and where you see how far we are away , what we really wanted to do , and how sad we are , we can actually see at all on earth , you can see that for example , there &apos;s a program , right ?
you can only be carbon-neutral if you don &apos;t exist , right ?
the only way .
have you ever seen a carbon-neutral tree ?
yes ?
one ?
that means our whole intelligence means that we want to be stupid than trees , right ?
yes ?
no tree is carbon neutral .
luckily , yes ?
there &apos;s no excess problem of trees .
there are still six of the trees in the amazon area alone .
you &apos;ve already heard about the human problem of trees ?
that means all of our intelligence means that we want to be stupid than trees .
and where you see , even in something like demeter , the most strikest bio- , agriculture , it doesn &apos;t allow us to go back .
every year we lose three million tons of phosphorus that should really go back into roundboards .
and we &apos;re too many .
it &apos;s alone .
that &apos;s what we feel so guilty about the earth that we are saying , there &apos;s no organic structure , no bioluminescence , no organic trance and how they &apos;re all hot , that allow our own excrements back .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
so we &apos;re too many .
it &apos;s safe to be less harmful , which is oil use .
but where are we useful ?
we &apos;re trying to minimize our ecological footprint , but it &apos;s about having a big footprint that &apos;s useful .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but if it &apos;s about the environment , it &apos;s the highest , right ?
nullemissions , yes ?
you can only have nutters if you &apos;re not there .
even if you shoot yourself , you would have emissions .
so you can &apos;t solve that .
we can do it differently .
we can extract our nutrients back .
we &apos;re doing agriculture in brazil where we extract the nutrients .
right ? we can get that kind of diet back into agriculture .
we &apos;re doing this in china , for example , where we &apos;re taking it directly .
in china , in china , a one-eyed today is even more recent , right ?
and in our western world , we were always too stupid to bring our nutrients back .
this is what the western civilizastory shows itself that the city has always taken , but the farmers have never given back to it .
so the cities had to grow more and more because the farmers went into the cities and the cities had to move away their nutrients .
that &apos;s why all western empires are always expanding , until they don &apos;t have done the infrastructure and then they &apos;re imploated .
yes ?
in china it was different .
you &apos;ve done a lot of progress about five years , because you &apos;ve always been able to bring back nutrients .
even today , if you &apos;re invited to food in china , you would expect to eat as long as you &apos;re looking for the toilet .
because it &apos;s unfriendly to go and raise nutrients .
you &apos;ve invited them to eat it , not to feed food .
that means you can see on the internet how to extract nutrients back .
this is really nice , if you do that , so agriculture is doing , biogas creates , in a hectb country with five people in favelas , and it can produce a farmer about a hundred hundred dollars , and the plant and vegetables and the fish and the fish and the fish .
and the great thing about this is that the crime rate in the favelas around nine percent goes back .
so we don &apos;t have to control the people who are poor .
we can support them to be good .
that &apos;s of course high-tech agriculture , but the plants carry themselves .
the side product is clean water .
and they &apos;re designed by design , which is a farmer you can just create .
that means the criminals are going back .
and none of these facilities , we &apos;ve now built over 100 fifths in the last twenty years , none of these facilities have ever been saboted .
you could just throw a liter of aladil , and then the plant would be ruined over years .
it doesn &apos;t happen .
that means we don &apos;t have to control people &apos;s lives , very poor .
we can support them to be good .
that means we need to get phosphorus back .
and by the way , if you want to do what you &apos;re going to do , you &apos;re going to write in germany at the best of all walks of life that are in frankdat .
unfortunately , not in open stream , but you may be able to help a little bit of the frankians .
because the frankians could get the phosphorus back to the phosphorus .
and that must go back .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
and we see that it &apos;s good .
we &apos;ve been using it now over three years .
the dutch government has explained , you will be the first country in the world , what phosphorus wins .
but we need that overall .
you know , there are two countries that control almost 770 percent of the world &apos;s phosphorus .
there &apos;s a bunch of orphans in opec .
these are six countries who control four percent of oil supplies .
and the oil is going to replace us through other energy benefits .
but you can &apos;t replace phosphorus .
that &apos;s not about making the existing a little less bad , but it &apos;s about making something right .
and it &apos;s especially to ask questions about what the right thing is .
it &apos;s about efficiency , it &apos;s not about efficiency .
in holland , of course , you understand easier because in holland , the country is built on flowers .
yes ?
imagine if your wife is sad , if you &apos;re mad , and you come with 50 .
totally inefficient .
but all of a sudden , yes ?
or take a lip pen .
a woman in germany eating about six pounds of her life .
.
that &apos;s not a science that &apos;s scientific , because because we don &apos;t know how much cool it is .
but a lip pen , even at that lighting , i can tell you , is completely inefficient , but all right ?
one of the things that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
that &apos;s not the resource efficiency , but efficiency .
to ask , what is the right thing ?
not a little bit better to burn , and to put it in the pipeline and lose it all the materials for roundboards , but first of all , how do you make roundboards ?
imagine mozart efficient .
yes ?
if i invite you to dinner and say yes , there &apos;s a pill with open taste and a glass of water .
wonderful , sir ?
that &apos;s efficient .
everything that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
if you fall in love with somebody , is efficient ?
yes ?
that means everything that matters is not about saving , avoid reducing .
all the environmental discussion .
we tell people , oh yes , you don &apos;t have an environmental awareness in the south .
no , that &apos;s the right thing , right ?
every single location , where you throw away , you create life again .
but the wrong things .
if you throw the wrong things away , you have a problem problem .
in how we think about north .
there &apos;s every foot footprint there .
if you walk , everybody ruins the floor .
because the soil is going to die the mosses and the wind and the water makes the soil .
but if you &apos;re in italy , every single footprint means that the water will stand longer in the meadow .
so , it &apos;s about making a big footprint that becomes a wetlands .
not school management .
we say in germany .
yes ?
but if i ask you how to do that with your wife ?
what do they say ?
sustainable .
then i say , heart of mine , right ?
that &apos;s just the minimum .
so not saving , save , avoid .
every waste is nutritious .
and it &apos;s a lust , if you see in italy , like the people in the high bow , the colacan out of the car .
because you know , that &apos;s a fun process .
it &apos;s the shape of re40s behavior , right ?
you can show , i was there .
but with the real design , please beautiful .
for example , we developed an ice tank that &apos;s in space temperature .
they can kick them away where they go and stand .
in two hours , they build all over the place .
and it contains seeds from rare plants so that they can contribute to the biodiversity .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
so there are two roundboards .
it &apos;s not all about being comppoable .
a television , or a washing machine , they just use it .
just the things that burn , like a shoe soles , like brasty , like the bulls , have to be in biological systems .
things that are only being used , go into technical systems .
but today we &apos;re only talking about the biological systems .
yes ?
for example , the victory , yes ?
all direct advertising , and it &apos;s not for the company , but it &apos;s for you now to help this company to make these products successful .
because we don &apos;t do the things more freely .
yes ?
so , if i invite you to eat and say , this is free , you don &apos;t help it .
no , we put what &apos;s inside .
positive .
so not like detox .
not toxic in the middle .
but everything that &apos;s inside is useful .
these are the first shoes that you can put the caxerstart on the foot , and the rubber can go into biological roundboards , right ?
it &apos;s all about it .
and when it comes to us , of course , it makes us for adidas , for nike , for henne and steritz and the whole textile industry .
and this is half of all the rest of the world &apos;s problems that are caused by the texture industry .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re going to help with people .
hey , puma , are you really serious ?
because they &apos;ve changed twice the head of head .
and i &apos;m not sure if she really is staying .
so , help me a little bit .
but it &apos;s .
yeah .
that &apos;s what &apos;s been presented right now .
this is .
we can do things like that now , if you &apos;re going to burn , if you break , you can go into biological roundboards .
technical roundboards are the same .
there &apos;s a direct retreat for this .
this is the first environmental backpack , actually , to go back to the circulation .
so , in every store , you can get things back .
if you get to that , yes ?
do you remember the windmill ?
when the trash is right now .
they &apos;re all around , almost .
in the countries where people are coming to money .
there on the front of it , but otherwise in the landscape , yes ?
if we change the plastic so that it can go into biological systems , if we change the water , you can just go back to cell atoms , and then you can plant a baby in israel or in tunisia , 100 trees .
yes ?
in fact , if you take these windel , you tear them , you rip them , and you take the powder to plant trees .
this is the baby carbon positive for all life , already .
so , we don &apos;t need carbon-neutral , we can be climate .
it &apos;s sort of a therapist &apos;s operation .
yeah , kind of .
yes ?
we can do that .
we can reinvent everything again .
i started a institute .
now , there are many people working there , and they can get involved .
there &apos;s extra one of them to crack craddle , where everyone can join .
so no longer saving , save , avoid , reduce , no school management , but intelligent waste .
does it make it curious ?
thank you .
the work of interpreting .
music as a language .
in the description of my speech , i said that i &apos;m as interpreted , as a translator , so in english lexicon , i understand .
they are vocabulary of the written notes in clinical music .
that as a translator , you &apos;re not just sending word word word to the text in a different language , but also the deeper sense of the words and the words of the words , so that it has to make a meaningful translation , everybody knows what to do with foreign languages .
from the german english to translate out of english , it can require more knowledge , as if it &apos;s about poetry or even poetry .
it &apos;s very alien for salmon , which we &apos;re doing with our musicians with our music .
as an interpretion of music , i first have the written notes .
you think that the composer is written in the notes just everything that he imagined .
in fact , the notes are very vague and unaccurate .
these notes are about exactly the same or inaccurate , just like a faking , as well as a very seemingly , a landscape of a landscape .
because in this highly verbal landscape , the smell of the flowers aren &apos;t too smell , the degrees of the greening , to not even even have to feel more honest , not to feel .
that means the interprety needs to take this unaccurate match in a different , which is hearing , concrete , non-verbal music language .
today i want to share with you what else i &apos;m doing , so animals , again , translate into a verbal language .
so basically , translation of translation .
so i would prefer to do this all the way to german , because if i had to do it again in english , it would be significant to me with translation of translation of translation .
so , the music is working for me as much as spoken word language .
the notes made the notes of the letters of a script .
so it &apos;s not enough to learn to read , just reading the notes and put it on the piano , or put the right spot on a violin .
because that &apos;s just the letters that you &apos;ve learned to paint .
the point of the letters , you can only see when you can do the language .
so , for the learning process of music , music requires at least equal for the spoken language .
in fact , there &apos;s also a way of learning whether you &apos;re learning it for the hesy , just passive understanding , or you can also speak active until the musical motherler .
the work of interpreting it looks similar to the way the directors class .
after first , if you &apos;ve chosen a piece of play , because you &apos;re excited about it , you &apos;re starting to start looking for the reasons of creating comedy .
you collect information about the piece in the segran literature .
you read in the letters , taps , notes , or whether it &apos;s words , thoughts itself .
you study the works that he wrote before and after .
you think of comparison .
the cause of writing it .
how and what did he find ?
how were its habitats , like the society and politics ?
it &apos;s all interested me .
you think of yourself in this time by looking at contemporary images , or reading literature .
but at the time , as a matter of time , you &apos;ve also known a rich knowledge to the composers that you &apos;re playing , and it falls a little bit easier to feel in it .
the composer is becoming more and more to a friend where you live together .
his cause to write the piece is becoming more and more and more to my personal cause .
now , there &apos;s the notes all other than a very accurate record of the composer , but just a framework , i now have this framework to fill it back with meaning and meaning .
i &apos;ll say to my own words , what could be written between this framework .
i play what these sounds might have .
now for me and for the composers , and what they might mean today .
every sound , every phrase gets a sense of it , because i feel it myself , because it &apos;s my personal life .
it &apos;s got to be true for me , and now i can &apos;t be able to convince my audience that this is my cause .
it &apos;s always a very happy concert , if i can have the experience that i &apos;ve worked so long in advance , like reexperiencing .
as you can re-meet a happy new day , even though with the same rituals of life , up to the same rituals of life , you get up , you get to work as well as i &apos;m doing the same thing .
i &apos;m getting older again , and i &apos;m getting out of seasons , and i &apos;m going to slow down my pulse in the evening as a morning , in a concert hall , it takes longer that sound comes back back home .
i &apos;ll take the request true of the audience , consciously or consciously .
all of that affects me and all of that also influenced my experience with comedy .
it &apos;s also wonderful , if i stand with a frao partner on stage and we have the same wavelength .
then the same thing happens in a good , decent conversation .
you bring a new idea into it , and soequally , that answers becomes a reaction .
it &apos;s exciting because then things that we haven &apos;t done , and what you can &apos;t do .
it makes a lot of fun to make music in this way , and then you have experienced the audience how the music communicates .
so every concert is another concert .
i &apos;m never going to play any more than that moment .
i can &apos;t play that way in 20 years today .
i &apos;m going to have more life experience than today , and therefore i &apos;m going to have a lot more color of music in the music sound of the music and emotion and emotion than today .
sure , i &apos;m going to put some color out of some color , but to get new .
have a nice example of this .
it was on a piano bike professor for musical students at my beloved old teacher , professor jzuman , a famous beethoven specialist , concert pianist and slow professor in stuttgart .
unfortunately , i was a lot too young , so that he was already emedy when i finally started studying .
but i had the great fortune , very early , with three years old , to meet and so i &apos;ve been at his high school time .
i was at the age of 10 when i went back to one of his courses , and i played the last of the four balbs of chopin , a gentleman .
he asked me what the emergence of these balgers were for me .
that &apos;s one of these genes .
and in my youth , i said , expectation .
and he said , &quot; he was like this . &quot;
that must be the old difference .
because for me , it means memory .
he was about six .
well , at the age of seven , you have dreams , but no major memories .
i play the play every few years , and it has changed for me , although not a single note has changed .
every time , it &apos;s exciting , because i always read something new .
this is an example from a very different area . monet has painted the sears .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but at different daytime time , in different light .
he &apos;s actually interacting with the seeroes that he saw , such as he saw it in this moment .
his personal impressions of the sears .
the x-malige interpretation of a piece of this is comparable .
now , i &apos;m also older than the chopin , when he wrote the piece .
he was only nine years old .
and it &apos;s important to me , again , to look back into the notes , even though i mean to you .
to keep the twin , right with the composer .
because the notes are the only connection to him .
especially when he died .
now , how do you start talking to the language of music ?
i said , you know , you have to do it for the same as the word language .
often the music class is that you learn to read the notes .
you &apos;re basically learning the reading before you &apos;re just speaking one word .
you learn to find the notes on the instrument .
and if all the fingers in time and right like it is in the notes , they come out , they come out sounds like music .
when the error is happening , the student gets the next difficult piece .
you can &apos;t talk about interpretation .
all right , there we go at the front , that &apos;s a rapid piece .
lento , slowly .
loud and leisep , f and b , etc .
that &apos;s what most of you know here .
but even if you take that shot , it still stays something technical .
and there &apos;s still no interpretation .
i wonder .
i wonder that you often forget something very basic .
because , in order to make music on the instrument , they should be doing their musical and feel before .
that &apos;s what sing .
a child who &apos;s not learned that , because it doesn &apos;t have the parents , it won &apos;t do it by itself .
it &apos;s like learning learning .
it &apos;s necessary to have its own experiences and the idea of the music to make it over another possibility , so to make it sound .
people who have never , have never felt immediately with their own body , like it is to form a sound .
a phrase with his own breath .
the music unit is the extension of our body .
our vocal tips to sing , our hands and feet to dance .
so the hammerheads in the piano are the sequel of my fingers .
the melody comes from the healthy and the rhythm of the dance .
the continellation reported with music today , not necessarily .
you don &apos;t need to make any more music if it &apos;s going to be boring .
no more need to whistle , or to sing .
every one of the music is being made by the outside of the music , when you &apos;re constantly charged by the outside .
surely , there are some of you who say , yes , but what if i can &apos;t sing ?
i &apos;m asking you , can &apos;t you sing , a , because you believe you can &apos;t sing ?
or b , because you haven &apos;t learned to sing ?
in both of them , it &apos;s not too late to start to figure out whether they can &apos;t do it , or learn how to do these little muscles , how to put these little muscles , right .
because you can train that .
or c , because you &apos;ve laid it down to you that you &apos;re unstoppable .
i was asking , how was this diagnosis that was ?
have you got a second one or a third opinion , how do you say beautiful today ?
or d , you don &apos;t like music , and therefore you have to have nix to do it .
but then what i would regret , because music is a beautiful , communicative thing .
but maybe you can revote them .
well , you can see , all of the cases don &apos;t have to be an intentional candidate .
but please don &apos;t say , i don &apos;t understand the classical music .
i can &apos;t say if it &apos;s good or bad .
i said , but surely you can tell if you like it or not .
because i don &apos;t think anybody says , i don &apos;t know if i can &apos;t cook because i can &apos;t cook .
so , you don &apos;t stop eating , just because you can &apos;t cook .
so they don &apos;t have to stop at classical music because they don &apos;t play any instrument .
listen consciously and say if it tastes or not .
whether music is too sweet or too sweet .
tell that what you feel .
at the time , you also get mastery and you want to have some more spices there or taste a difference .
why am i asking now from my audience that it &apos;s also active ?
because the music is a language and a language is to communicate .
a piece of art that you never look at has no power .
the food that was cooked by a chef or a chef must be eaten and not just looked at or gathering recipes .
so please hear , if a music is played .
it &apos;s not just a nice sound pete .
if in a environment where the adults are doing music , or at least active music , a child grows , then it &apos;s very easy to ask for a music teacher who has color ?
can you also play it in blue ?
and the child is playing , after a memorial , instead of a red flower now .
and this sounds very different .
and that was the first beginning of a kind of musical expression .
so the first step to a interpretation .
and what happens when you &apos;re going to play a piece today that has been written a hundred , two hundred or a half years ago , about two hundred years ago ?
now , the instruments have continued .
there was actually no piano on it as an instrument .
it was just not invented .
i think that the bach would have been excited if he had the sound possibilities of the modern zoo .
i can now tell you the sound of sound that the bach has had to sound on the modern wing , which is not a baroc cemo .
by beethoven , you know that he heard more when he had become deaf .
today , a modern orchestra in the position is to play everything that &apos;s considered an orchestra by the time .
so the composers are interpreting us , which is rereinventing the pieces again .
so you &apos;re listening to what you &apos;re looking at in mind .
and also , what you would think of today in the spirit .
or what i &apos;m thinking about today , because what you might have thought about .
thank you .
you know what envy is ?
were you even envy ?
and how did that feel ?
suck .
i have a friend driving a passport .
so when i come , with my little v w , i &apos;m going to go and sit on this feeling .
i put something through the head .
i say ultra-f , what do you need a big car ?
that &apos;s what it loses for the first year .
and at all , you work much less than i do .
why do i have to afford little car ?
and then i &apos;ll immediately get to that .
it &apos;s against justice .
and as i say the word justice , this is unpleasant feeling .
our organism has invented a great way to make these inpleasant feelings like envy just to go away .
you can also try that with words like revenge or profit .
i want to explain to you a little bit about this mechanism today , or something that makes you unconsciously familiar with it .
the mechanism is from a lie .
but don &apos;t think of the lie as you may have heard , when people say nobody has a wall to build a wall .
and then , you know , there &apos;s rocks coming up .
in such a lie , you see that the licself doesn &apos;t believe what he says .
it makes it easy to check that it has a very different sense of meaning .
he just deceips them and not himself .
no , the lie that i &apos;m talking about , which has to do with it , that they will fake themselves .
you need this vision to have a life lie to get a self-delusion .
they can make them less easily , yes , to check out or down .
they need time .
from that time , an anecdote speaks you to know .
the spanish painter donablo picasso once has a woman .
and this woman came in , the portrait would not see her at all .
picasso says , wait .
it will always be similar to you .
at this point , and when you laugh , you see how important this lie is and how much time you need to experience what artists can say very well .
because artists have a broken relationship to lie .
the artist gives you something , and especially this lady , which you don &apos;t see when you just look in the mirror .
the artist gives you something like this in a portrait that you &apos;re just going to be familiar with when you look at this piece of work .
then this unpleasant feeling , it could not look like you can &apos;t see it , and it will always happen .
here you have this mechanism , with which we can use the lie as a great invention to overcome our lifestyle .
and not only in art , even in the people who are in the mythology , in stories , it shows up .
you may know this idea of the lady who looked at the mirror every morning and asked him who is the most beautiful in the country ?
one day , this mirror says yes , there &apos;s a more beautiful .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
and you also know how much hostility from that real fact , the mirror can &apos;t lie , from that real point .
but we should just make sure that you can &apos;t tell a woman that there &apos;s a more beautiful somewhere else .
here &apos;s how we understand what we &apos;re seeing under the doodle .
we need this kind of vision that holds us the illusion of maintaining the deception without us .
we don &apos;t just have in art , in terms of folk poetry , but also in science , such great lies .
and there &apos;s this story of the bischoze of the bischoze of worchester .
she heard about this book of charles darwin , the origin of the species and the line of the people .
that the man from the apes should come and , yes , at least a common ancestor between people and apes .
and then she ran her to her husband , and she said , well , that &apos;s probably not true , charles da writes .
the man is supposed to come out of the monkey or have a common ancestor .
no , no , it &apos;s not .
and if it &apos;s true , then we need to prevent people understanding it .
why do we need to prevent people to achieve something if it &apos;s true ?
because we can &apos;t live without this kind of life .
because we have this self-deception , this sense of being great , from the highest creatures , not from one such thing , of something that is uncalculated like an organism that exists , like a brick , and what things like that , that &apos;s unstoppable .
so , we can &apos;t delay these things .
we need to prevent people getting opportunities from things , especially when they are true .
so you can see how slowly this mechanism solves itself , and how the traces that he leaves , which is going to lead to something different than this great picture of ourselves , i want to get to you another story .
a particularly beautiful story , like me .
my wife told me it .
she came from school one day , she &apos;s a teacher , she was talking about a student .
a autistic student .
it likes especially to him because it has a tendency to dissolve .
and she asked him what are you ?
and he says , well , i &apos;m at the firewar .
and because i &apos;m in the fireprize , i &apos;m interested in paroengineering things .
yes , they feel it if they &apos;re hot at this point . there &apos;s something wrong .
i said to my wife , whenever a human being in a moral law that &apos;s used literal because we should try and replace it through the literal self .
do that once and then you learn the sentence .
although i &apos;m in the firedefense , i &apos;m interested in paroengineering things .
they feel that this is the actual truth behind the sequence .
this is a little bub who &apos;s interested in fire .
they &apos;re interested in firemaking .
but there are no offenses to look at where you can learn how to do fire .
there &apos;s just the second best , just the fire force .
there he behaves .
and again , you &apos;re not saying to his teacher that you &apos;d like to put in anywhere , and you &apos;re happy when the fire gets up after it .
no , it just looks much better if we show that we are in charge of eliminating the dangers , the other only , if you just put fire .
here you have this little mechanism .
this evidence of knowing that in the first of the world &apos;s war knew that it &apos;s actually related to the fire , but that it can &apos;t tell you .
so here you have this deadline between the unconscious and the conscious , which immediately drives you , without doing anything about it , and the things that you know that you can look quite differently , so it creates much better for you and others .
so , just like that , the words that we have in the language of the politically correct speech is always using again .
we actually know that something else is .
but we know when we &apos;re talking about it , the social news is very sensitive .
we can &apos;t just do that .
it &apos;s impossible to do things like that in a society that should work .
i want to leave you with what we found in my institute .
what logic that deception , these self-deception , the willingness , a different reality as the one we actually know in the unconscious , is to spread beyond the outside .
i want to share with you two , maybe three examples .
the first example requires what many of you know and some of you appreciate , very few people don &apos;t need at all .
i mean the soul .
what is the soul ?
the soul is such a spiritual , it &apos;s about leibniz .
it &apos;s something that &apos;s not dependent , materially nature .
and if you have people who are the solid belief that they own a soul , or you can also say that they have been given from the soul to life , then they think about it as if the soul is such a spiritual frame of them , not from matter , and it &apos;s a little bit of a stone , unimportant , unimportant , unimportant , unimportant , unstoppable , unchanging .
and from that soul , you &apos;re thinking that you somehow kind of live in this cloudy nature , in this air nature , anima is in latin , right ?
and then , if this air hall is over the people , it &apos;s filled with dignity , with the mind , with nature that can only live , yes with soul .
and then he can walk away .
that &apos;s what the soul looks like .
so it &apos;s going to come from the outside to humans .
so we should think of them as something that really should be present for our lives .
and if you have this assumption in front of you , you understand the logic that we experience with this happiness through a lie to our world .
because now you can use a three-sentence .
you &apos;re still familiar with the school .
this is now a three-sentence that describes a logic .
this is the hardest part in my talk by the way .
here you need some logic , but also the willingness to lie .
and that &apos;s why to lie that you can just apply this logic wrong .
in this three-sentence , three sentences come in .
the first sentence is , fine claims , there &apos;s no soul .
so the second sentence is , if it &apos;s right , it has no soul .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
i came up with him particularly .
a third sentence that immediately comes up with people who have a strong sense of soul .
they say who doesn &apos;t have a soul who is dead and can &apos;t say anything .
and here they are .
here &apos;s the logic in this , yes , in this gesture of expression .
you see it immediately .
the first two sentences , they &apos;re logical .
because i can say everything .
the logic doesn &apos;t make any claim about reality .
i can say the canary is a man .
and if i have right , the canary is a man .
if i don &apos;t right , the canary is not a man .
the logic doesn &apos;t make a point about what &apos;s wrong .
i can say everything .
but the key thing is , when i &apos;m right , it &apos;s true .
so if sound says , there &apos;s no soul .
second , if he &apos;s right , he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
these things are logical .
and now our disconsciousness feels like you can do something about it .
it &apos;s a third sentence that doesn &apos;t have anything to do with the first two sentences , and that &apos;s how the opposite of the first sentence already proved and predicted .
because actually , we have to prove whether there &apos;s the soul or not .
but with this logic that &apos;s just using it , that two sentences are logical , and a third , which looks like he would have to do with it , so we can save our lifestyle .
so , we pretend it &apos;s actually impossible without being able to live a soul .
and we &apos;re very happy about it .
we can lead these things to different examples .
in the presence of about , we have a modern example that keeps the daynewspapers .
what you have to do is have another philosophical issue , a permanent quality of philosophy , present .
it has to do with it that we go back to the fourth century .
there was a scholars called johannes buridanus and after that , he named the buridansche esel .
the buridansche esel is an esel who &apos;s made out of nature .
it &apos;s not that soul .
this is a natural thing .
and if you put the exact in the middle between two and a half of the big harbor harbor , he &apos;s hungry .
because he doesn &apos;t know what to do at first .
so it &apos;s in the middle .
that &apos;s how nature is introduced .
we have to solve a lot of forces .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
just when you get another example , so if you get a lot bigger , then you don &apos;t need a lot of reason and nothing to do .
automatically runs to the right thought .
so if you have this idea that in nature you &apos;re somehow driven in nature , depending on the larger piles of the larger , you also have the feeling that there must be something like a free will .
and as we &apos;re already here in frankchot at main , i remember the max-pland-institute institute of brain research .
there &apos;s a scholars that &apos;s called the wolf synthesizer , and from him you say sometimes , wolf , there &apos;s no freedom .
now , again , we can create the second sentence , and we can say , if wolf therapist has right , it has no freedom .
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
and what we can now read in the daily newspaper everyday , that you can find in this third sentence .
it looks like who doesn &apos;t have liberty , can &apos;t be moved for its actions and claims to the responsibility and the claims , and therefore it &apos;s misproof .
again , you have it again .
in fact , you &apos;re supposed to have to prove if there &apos;s something like liberty .
but the logic of deception allows us to do this as if the first sentence of suburnin is wrong when the first sentence , of course , to accept the opposite without proof .
and now you can just do if you want to do anything , if you want to test yourself , and especially when you want to make people happy , that courage to practice to lie .
do you practice that for example , if you look at a person who you can say , there &apos;s no predictable .
and please don &apos;t use the german word for predicted , which means the prophet .
they &apos;re not allowed to call it a little more politically accurate .
tell me there are no predicted .
you &apos;re going to get one of those , of course , for those of you who are the ones that you can &apos;t prove .
and you &apos;ve got a problem .
because while you &apos;re working with it , you can &apos;t prove that you can &apos;t prove that there is no previous man .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he deceived them .
because he had led them to a ride he doesn &apos;t even hold himself .
because actually , this person is not interested in evidence .
he &apos;s just interested in remembering himself before the need to prove that there are predicted .
so , in the way the evidence of evidence , they experience the brilliance of lying .
and once you have an opportunity to feel that three-sentence in other people , you do it , because you &apos;re going to make other happy , if you don &apos;t remember it in your self-lying .
thank you for your attention .
yeah , good afternoon .
i &apos;ve allowed myself to have some lilly if i could mention it .
she &apos;s one of the editors here from this great event , and i asked myself if i had a talk here and give me an approach .
i &apos;ve got to say , you know , you get it , it fell hard to me at first .
and i might like to imagine my island project that i try to imagine you .
but , of course , it &apos;s the sum very , very many ideas .
i &apos;m probably , you know , the two nice girls , i &apos;m probably going to be in the generation , which has an image for this bad oko image , because i &apos;ve started nine and a half hundred feet ago , building machine education , and it &apos;s called , i think , a kit .
and i &apos;d put it in the mid-80s for berlin , because i wanted to do renewable energy and i didn &apos;t have it .
there was the nuclear research plant leopolar .
all of the kads , the jewish was also called kfa .
the hot ones today .
because a good engineer did not have amazing cars or nuclear power plants .
but these doofes like &quot; n solar pendel , &quot; which comes out of a hundred watt out of the square meter that was a toy .
and in berlin , there was a crazy engineering collection .
i &apos;m grateful to the nasa colleague that he repaired the word again again , because after the mouth , you didn &apos;t use the word anymore because everything was bad .
but it wasn &apos;t that way in the 1950s .
it was that there was self-organized alternative enterprise , and one of them was sitting in exiberg , where you suspected evil .
in the center of terror , but it was called beltronics and did wind -- and solar energy , and i started in the middle of the 18th .
and yes , a lot of what was said today , i &apos;m very , very touched by this , because many , many beautiful indistrations that i have lived through .
i spent 11 years working in the collective that was grassroots .
we were 20 people .
if there was no said , that &apos;s the fatopbesis , which has a totally blursed . i &apos;ve got 10 years to do it for a decade , whether i might really do my great engineering study , because , you know , all of the colleagues of my father gave it to the window .
it &apos;s working with flaws .
and that was really , really , very bitter and you also come into this phase , just showing a picture of where i asked myself for 10 years , a thousand d-mark mark , and in fact , of course , that might be the great thing .
and then i went up to six and a half , and then we came together with friends of the company , who then came together with the spin-off of one of the largest cell manufacturer in the world .
it &apos;s a massive history story , but also , of course , we have the problem of a growing company and we have two thousand , a small group , decided we &apos;re going to start again and go back to the next topic of the future , and we think , &quot; again , people are saying what &apos;s going to be wrong , we &apos;re going to talk about it . &quot;
and i brought you a project that i &apos;d like to take you now .
and the title of talking was , as you get to 100 percent renewable .
and we just started to ask just a relatively simpler crazy story , where you could use a memory for you today .
on this island , this is the island graciosa on the azoren .
yeah , these are the data .
there are four and a half thousand people .
this is a five-percent energy reduction today .
and the question is , why don &apos;t you have any more ?
it &apos;s just not technological .
if you build more wind power , the system begins to fail .
i &apos;m always telling politicians when they &apos;re in berlin-adlershof our facility .
they &apos;re always saying why ?
we &apos;ve got 20 percent in germany .
it can &apos;t be a problem .
but it &apos;s not true , we have seven percent in europe , and our network is physically the european .
if we had 20 percent in europe , we would have the same problems that people have on this island .
the question was simple , and it was a thousand000-year 2006 , the first contact with the island , but it just started .
as big as it would have to be a battery , so you have to have an island on 20 , 30 , four , 50 , maybe even 70 percent renewable .
and yeah , i &apos;ll go back a slide again .
the conventional system is seeing all over the world .
by the way , a hundred gigawatts of electrical performance on the planet is built in the world .
that &apos;s the equivalent of a hundred nuclear power stations , because it &apos;s very fast everywhere .
the energy hunger the world is going to take place , because you don &apos;t need permission .
it goes fast .
you put it in there .
and then it &apos;s in the rule .
in the run always three of those , two will always be waiting .
yeah , this is what it looks like at the bottom .
we &apos;ve also got very accurate data .
and the wind plant , or the solar device , or whatever it is , is usually a close-up system , a system of what can only be eaten in small quantities here .
our goal was to say , okay .
and the beam of this is going to end up , and the wind , the sun is driving the load so that they can form the larger percentage .
and if you want to go about 20 , 30 percent renewable energy , energy per year , not the performance at the moment , then you have to turn off the cover .
that means that , in the moment , you have to worry that renewables are kind of the whole network .
you can only , of course , if you &apos;re going to be here in some kind of way .
that has no one in the world .
it &apos;s in the little style , so you can also use your shores on your car .
people always ask me , what do you actually do in eaop shof ?
that &apos;s what it is .
but if you want to mobilize several of these interconnectedness , and you want to build a net , it will be extremely complicated .
and our goal was , we wanted to get 70 to nine percent renewable , and then there &apos;s still this rest of the rest that last 10 , the last 10 , 20 percent renewable , that will become very , very expensive , and that &apos;s not going to work that you &apos;re going to do it out of batteries .
it &apos;s certainly a matter of energy , which then , you know , hydrogen , methane , power to gas you know that it will be .
you have to go to a seasonal store , and winter summer and not just tag-night .
we just wanted to know what &apos;s going on with a normal , snormal electrochemical battery .
how far do you get there at all ?
and then a whole bunch of simulations .
and wind and sun , and the burden simulating , and came to the conclusion , a very exciting outcome that you have to get to the conventional system for about 20 cents a kilowatt-hour hour .
these were the very first calculations six years ago .
and then we said , okay .
it &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
we &apos;re cheaper like the encoder system , if the arch prices increase five percent per year .
and then we started negotiating with the doodle .
what needs to be done ?
now , with investors , i have new shells .
we were only five people back to rebuild the society .
and here &apos;s the representation .
the brown is kind of the conventional system , the green one is our system .
that our system has an amputation , it &apos;s because we &apos;re going to do 20 percent of it , and it &apos;s not a price increase on the other things .
and the power-doodle , which is the electritional utility company on the island , has meant that we &apos;re very great .
we also want to support , but we don &apos;t believe you can solve the technical problem .
and that &apos;s why we decided to build a hall in berlin where we can kind of map the electrical domain of the island at three very precisely .
so that &apos;s what we &apos;re looking for , the largest battery of the world .
here she is .
it comes from asia from asia to the trap of japan .
and funily , it &apos;s in the &apos; 70s at bbc crew at bbc &apos;s home , and now she &apos;s been licensed , and then she was licensed in the japanese .
you can see it &apos;s a very , very large battery .
she has a megawatts of performance , and she can bring that performance for six hours , and that &apos;s the battery that we &apos;ve kind of got out of the scanner .
and then they set up .
we also have one of these uv-doodle in the same size , as it &apos;s standing there , to actually put the entire dynamic behavior from this grid , so in the hall , it looks like this , there &apos;s the big battery that we &apos;re going to simulate on the web .
over here , we &apos;re going to simulate the whole transfer of communication system , the national physics of wires to sort of form the vibrational behavior in the web .
and here you can see the whole thing again .
we can also switch two hundred kilowatts of photovoltaics on the web .
so here we see this again , again , again , again , the whole , individual therapist .
and what we &apos;ve been doing since two-thousand9 was the hall , until today &apos;s two thousand and a half thousand senses , just to develop everything between the individual system of electronics , in software , we did .
so we &apos;re not a battery maker , but we define ourselves as a company that stands only between the subject and the issue , and everything in between .
you have to communicate with the battery , of course , to communicate , you can also communicate in the net , and that &apos;s very complicated .
the nice thing is that you &apos;re basically in this island today that you can basically get rid of the problem that we &apos;re going to get if we want to raise our share of renewables .
so this whole discussion , as is going to move back and forth , energy turn , how to go , for example , on the island , we have for five to 30 percent of total energy energy , so we refuse the wind and the sun .
the natural light is then evolving .
so smart grid , a huge issue everywhere .
we can start to integrate an electrical mobility on the island , so you can say , you can do the burden .
that means when you &apos;re 70 percent renewable , you can &apos;t do it without memory .
you can do it by n smart grid , you can do it by building nets , yes , you should do it anyway , the proportion of hearing , but you can never get rid of memory completely .
and that &apos;s the message .
so many people come and look at this , because you can see what problems you get .
if we switch off the following , you don &apos;t have these roders that cause some kind of inertia in the net .
and our european verbal network is essentially made of dense masses of big power plants where the wave is all around europe .
we look in this web , and we see 50 hertz , and when it &apos;s nine , it &apos;s nine hertz , we start to do a little fan , then we go back a little bit .
that &apos;s the system .
and of course , this is an incredibly metric .
if you tear that down somewhere , it takes a long time .
the ambulance reserve has at least 10 seconds to keep the net stable .
and in time , they can react again .
if you don &apos;t have that anymore , you &apos;ve got to replace this rotating mass , then you &apos;ve got to do this with a choice and electrochemistry .
and we can switch into this big battery two milliseconds .
and then you already see the enormous scale there .
and the message is , we need to stay on these rooth masses , if we kind of like our goals , 20 , 20 , 20 , 20 , 30 , 30 , 30 , 30 , and so on , if we want to reach at all .
then we have to break our must-capacity running in the net .
must-run is simply running the power station to keep the frequency .
yes , this is a huge debate right now , building the coal fuel plant , because we don &apos;t , or gasturbinzing , because it &apos;s not .
and we &apos;re just trying to make sure that you have the capacity to run the capacity capacity , break down , get electrochemical memory to the net .
now , fortunately , there &apos;s a lot of studies .
and then , to this purpose , people will come and look at our initial research , sort of , our island .
and yes , the discussion is always about the question of how far you can take away a piece of future .
and many discussions that i &apos;ve had in the last six years were similar to the discussion that i had over the last 30 years , in the last 30 years .
it &apos;s not , you know , failures , child play stuff , we &apos;ve never got it .
we have 30 gigawatts today in the germany .
it &apos;s a precursor .
and i &apos;m just going out of this , in the next 30 years , we &apos;re going to store the same capacity of electrochemical in the world .
very simple , it will come .
there &apos;s going to be a whole lot of disconsistenments there .
the nice thing is that i &apos;ve been in the last two years now that the scientists have come up with my site .
we &apos;ve now gotten over tens of millions of thousands of years of projects to get to the german net battery now .
this is going to happen in april next april .
so , from that , you also realize that there &apos;s a change there , and it &apos;s just that there &apos;s a hundred percent of the way that we think about it , a hundred percent renewable , right ?
and if you have a hundred percent renewable , it &apos;s like a auot system .
so far , in discussions , it &apos;s always trying to do these philanthrolanders , who are doing , they have a small , small net , that has nothing to do with our verbal and nothing .
the question , though , is very simple , if you &apos;re completely autonomous from any fossil or non-conservation energy that will be formed somewhere in the world and being brought to you , you &apos;re an island .
then they only use what &apos;s there in the sun and wind there , where they live .
and this is a little bit of our vision of a voluntary energy supply , and i &apos;m grateful to cradle to be grateful that they used to use solar energy .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing , and as far as we can do , the talk of nira collagen is that you may be able to be a collective and use solar energy .
and yes , i just want to encourage you , in the sense that you can be a little bit crazy and also have a vision .
and you really have to stay really tough , but i think it &apos;s going .
thank you .
when steve lopez , columnist , the los angeles times , went through the streets of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , an african-american , sympathy , rau , homeless , who played on a violin that had only two sads .
many of you will know the story , because from the article , it was later a book that was turned on , with robert tzney junior , as steve lopez and jamie buffx , who studied the most promising career , and most of the most promising career in the process of his paranoatory schizophrenia .
nathaniel left juilliard , suffered a nerve breakdown , and 30 years later he lived as homeless on the streets of skid row in the center of los angeles .
i suggest to you all the book to read , or to look at the movie , so you don &apos;t just understand the wonderful connectedness that was born between these two men , but also how the music helped these connection , and how they finally did the instrument , when they were allowed to get the instrument to listen .
i met mr. aoren in 2008 , two years ago , tour disney hall hall .
he had just heard a demo of beethoven &apos;s first and fourth senses and came out behind the stage to imagine .
he spoke in a very , very much , and they were talking about yo-yo ma , and hillary clinton , and how the dodgers would never create it in the baseball world series , and that &apos;s all because of the sacred passage in the last sentence of beethoven &apos;s fourth senses .
we came to speak to the issue of music , and a few days later , i got an email in which that nathaniel was interested in me .
i &apos;ve got to say that nathaniel has a medical treatment , because it was already with electroshocks and with cosacine and hand-filled , a trauma that has his whole life .
now , as a result , he &apos;s especially vulnerable for these schizophrenics , and they &apos;re sometimes so bad , and he &apos;s walking away in the streets of skid row , that horror and punk of his own mind .
and in the same way , nathaniel was when we started collecting our first lesson in the tour disney hall hall , and he was completely lost in his eyes .
he was talking about invisible demons and smoke and about how somebody wanted to sleep in sleep .
i was afraid of , not mine , but i was afraid that i could lose him in one of his states , and that i could break him down to the violin if i started , and i could destroy his relationship to the spirit of sound and the other exciting shapes .
so i just started playing .
i played the first sentence of beethoven &apos;s violin concert .
and while i was playing , i noticed that in nathanii &apos;s eyes was going to be a complete change .
it was as if he was under the influence of an invisible doctor , a chemical response , which was catalytic .
nathanii manmanturned , in understanding , turned into a quiet curiosity and encouragement .
and like a miracle , he took his violin and began to play a couple of cuts from violinconcert and then asked me to start playing them : mendelsson , tsettikoshaw , siffus .
we started talking about music , starting from bach through beethoven , brams , brugue and all the other parts , from bartók to esbs .
and i realized that he had not only had an ideological knowledge about music , but it was related to her .
he talked about her with a passion and an understanding that i just know from my colleagues in the philharmony of los angeles .
by playing music and talking about music , it was made of this paranoid , confused man who had just moved through the streets of los angeles , a loving , educated , well-packed musician .
music is medicine . music changes us .
for nathaniel , music means secondary health .
because the music allows him to transform his thoughts and delusions with his imagination and creativity in a real way .
and that &apos;s how he passes his agonizing condition .
i understood that this is exactly the nature of art .
this is the reason why we make music : so we do something that goes deep inside of all of us , our emotions , through our artistic lens , through our creativity to reality .
and the reality of that expression is that all of us , and move , is inspired and united .
what nathaniel did , it brought the music back into a community of friends .
they brought it back to the music of music in a family of music , who understood that his talent was recognized and he was holding him .
and i &apos;m always going to play with nathaniel musicians , whether in the tours disney hall hall or in skid row , because he reminds me of why i have become musicians .
thank you .
bruno giussani : thank you . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play a little bit that i &apos;ve stolen the most unspeakly stolen .
i hope you &apos;ll forgive me .
so i have a lot of fish in my life .
i just loved two .
this first , that was more like a passionate spouse .
it was a beautiful fish , well-motivated , well-consistent , well-consistent , a best selling on the menu .
what a fish .
even better , he was convicted in aquaculich according to the highest standards of sustainability .
so you could feel about selling it .
i had a relationship with this beauty of several months .
one day , the head of the company called , and asked if i could carry on an event on the farm of the farm .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
this is a company that was trying to solve what &apos;s become the unimaginable problem for our cooks . how do we keep fish on our menu ?
in the last 50 years , we &apos;ve planted the ocean as we &apos;ve beaten forests .
it &apos;s hard to overrate destruction .
90 percent of the big fish that we love , the tunas , the healing , the lax , the lax , the heavy fish , they &apos;re broken together .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
so , you may have or nauaquaculch , which is a part of our future .
a lot of arguments on it . fish polling the environment , most of them , and they &apos;re inefficient , let &apos;s take tuna . a big disadvantage .
he &apos;s got a food score from 15 to one .
so , 15 pounds of wild fish are necessary to get a pound tuna .
not very sustainable .
it doesn &apos;t taste very well .
so here was a company that was trying to do it right .
i wanted to get them supported .
on the day before the event , i called the ceo of public art for the company .
let &apos;s call it don &apos;t .
&quot; don &apos;t , &quot; i said , &quot; just to have the facts right , you &apos;re famous to build the way out in the sea that you don &apos;t have the environment . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s true , &quot; he said . &quot; we are so far outside that the waste of our fish is distributed , not focused . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; we are basically a world .
these nutritions of stand-up to one , &quot; he said .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
in addition to one , great .
&quot; testimony to one thing ? what are you eating ? &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . put it on .
and at that evening , i was in bed , and i thought , what hell is a sustainable protein ?
so i called the next day , just before the event , don &apos;t .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said he doesn &apos;t know . he &apos;ll be asked .
well , i had a couple of people in the company . no one could give me a proper answer . until i finally ended up with the senior biologists .
let &apos;s call it don &apos;t .
&quot; don &apos;t , &quot; i said , &quot; for example , what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some algae and some fish , and then he said , chicken pellets .
i said , &quot; chicken pellets ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , skin , skin marrow , bone flds , dry and food . &quot;
i said , &quot; how much percent do you spend chicken ? &quot;
in the assumption of maybe two percent .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t what is sustainable to feed chicken to fish ? &quot;
there was a long pause in the line , and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken in the world . &quot;
i loved this fish .
no , not because i &apos;m feeling a self-intentious and good man .
that &apos;s me even .
no , i actually love this fish , because , in fact , i swear to god , the fish after that conversation after chicken .
this second fish , this is another kind of love story .
it &apos;s the romantic way that you know the better you know your fish , the more you love the fish .
i ate it first in a restaurant in southern spain .
a trained journalist has been talking about this fish for a long time .
it &apos;s kind of obsolete us .
he came to the table with a bright , fast white color .
the chef had cooked him .
stop twice .
he was still delicious .
who can make a fish taste so well after being cooked ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
let &apos;s call it miguel . it &apos;s actually called miguel .
and no , he didn &apos;t cook the fish , and he &apos;s not a chef , at least in the way that she and i understand .
he &apos;s a biologist at juna la palma .
this is a fish in the southern western corner .
it &apos;s near the coins of the river guadalvir .
until the 1980s was the farm in the hands of argentinians .
they were breeding carnibeef on what was essentially wetlands .
they did that by rejecting the country .
they built this complicated product of channels , and they turned out water from the land and out into the river .
well , they couldn &apos;t do that , they didn &apos;t work .
and green was a disaster .
it killed about 90 percent of the birds , which is a lot of birds .
and so in 1982 , in 1982 , a spanish company bought the country .
what did they do ?
they have the flow of the water .
they literally put the lever .
instead of using the water out , they used the channels to pull the water back .
they ran the channels .
they created a 11,000 acres of fish -- barsch , mermaid , shrimp , oal -- and they have miguel and his company completely conversely .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
they stare out on the horizon , which is a million miles away , and all they &apos;re looking at is fluched channels and that density , and the dense march .
i wasn &apos;t a long time ago with miguel .
he &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts charles darwin and a part of &quot; a crocodile kissing . &quot;
okay ? there we were , and we fought through the wetlands and i borrow , and i swear to my knees to my knees , and miguel is holding a biology lecture .
here he picks up a rare bar .
now , he mentioned the mineral needs of phytoplankton .
and here , here he looks a pattern of psychiatrists that reminds him the vegetation giraffe .
it turns out that miguel was spent the biggest part of his career in mikumi national park in africa .
i asked him how to become such a fish expert .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish .
i &apos;m an expert for relationships . &quot;
and then he goes and goes into more of the rare birds and algae and weird water plants .
and don &apos;t get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the biotic community unbridged in the way .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
and my head was weak about this piece of delicious fish that i had on the board .
so i cut him . i said , &quot; miguel , how does it taste so good ? &quot;
he showed up the algae .
&quot; i know boy , the algae , the phytoplankton , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible .
but what are your fish eating ?
how is the score ? &quot;
now , he goes on to tell me that it &apos;s such a rich system that the fish eat what they would eat in the wild .
the plant biomass , the physical toplankton , the zooplankton , that &apos;s what the fish are feeding .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely self-innovative .
there &apos;s no food .
the one from a farm , who doesn &apos;t feed their animals ?
later , i went around on this site with miguel , and i asked him , i said , &quot; for a place that seems to be so natural , &quot; unlike any farm i &apos;ve ever been , &quot; how do you measure success ? &quot;
in the moment , it was as if a magician would have a stage shift .
and we bow around the corner , and we have the most incredible sight , thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of pinker goes to the eye .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at your colorful , pink .
they &apos;re bad . &quot;
bad ? i was completely confused .
i said , &quot; miguel , don &apos;t you a fish ? &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and fish eggs .
well , last year on this site , 600,000 birds were more than 250 different types .
it &apos;s become the largest and one of the most important private bird reserves in europe .
i said , &quot; miguel , is there a good bird who is not the last thing you want to put on a fish ? &quot;
he went his head , no .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building randomness , not intense .
this is an environmental network .
the flkans goes down the shrimp .
the shrimp eat the physical toplankton .
so the vibrations the gut the better the system . &quot;
okay , let &apos;s rethink that . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed your animals and a farm that measures your success on your patient &apos;s health .
one fish , but also a bird reserve .
oh , and by the way , these flmies should not even be there .
they breed in a city of 240 miles away where the ground exchange is better for the nest maintenance workers .
they fly 240 miles every morning .
and every night they fly 360 miles back .
they do that because they can follow the white line of the land on the street .
seriously .
i introduced a journey of the penguins , so i looked at miguel .
i said , &quot; miguel , are you flying 240 miles from the farm and then you go back to 240 miles at the night ?
do you do that for the children ? &quot;
he looked at me when i was just a song of whitney houston .
he said , &quot; no . they do that because the food is better . &quot;
i mentioned not the skin of my beloved fish , which was delicious , and i don &apos;t like fish skin . i don &apos;t like them . i don &apos;t like it .
it &apos;s the curved taste .
i almost never cook with it .
and yet , when i tried it in the southern spain in this restaurant , she didn &apos;t swaled for fish at all .
they tasted sweet , and they would take a bite from the ocean .
i mentioned that to miguel and he was nocking .
he said , &quot; the skin works like a sponge .
it &apos;s the last resort before something goes into the body .
it &apos;s evolved over the evolution of evolution . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; but our water has no inflammation . &quot;
okay . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed your fish . a farm that measures your success at the success of your predators .
and then i realized , when he says , a farm that doesn &apos;t have an incessation , he would take enormous , because the water that comes through this farm comes from the river .
it &apos;s a river that causes all of the things that are affected by the rivers today , they tend to lead to chemical pollutants .
and if it fought through the system , and that leaves is the water clean , as it is .
the system is so healthy , it cleds water .
so not only a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals , not just a farm that measures their success in their health of their predators , but a farm which is literally a water lift plant , and not just for those fish , but for you and me .
because when the water flows out , it breaks down in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;m going to take it , and that &apos;s what you should do , because this love story , as well as romantic , is also subparsive .
you could say that you &apos;re a recipe for the future for good food , whether we &apos;re talking about barsch or meat .
what we need now is a radical new concept of agriculture , from one , in fact , good taste .
but for many people , it &apos;s a little bit radical .
we &apos;re not a realistic , we &apos;re enjoying it . we &apos;re lover .
we love daily markets . we love small family shops . we talk about local food . we &apos;re eating organic food .
and if they say that these are the things that are good food that is good food , someone will say , &quot; hey guys , i love rock rock , but how are they going to feed the world ?
how will they feed the world ? &quot;
can i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like this question .
no , not because we already produce enough calories to feed the world more than just feeding .
one billion people will starve today .
a billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because krashes in the distribution , not the overall production .
well , i don &apos;t like this question because it has the logic of our food system for the last 50 years .
and the grain of plant predators , pest fighters on monocultures , chemicals on the earth , chicken to fish , and the whole time , the agricultural industry simply asked , &quot; if we feed more people cheaper , how awful can it be ? &quot;
this was the cause . it was the law . it was the business plan of the american agriculture .
we should call them what she is , a business in abentation , a business that is rapidly empowering , which is just the production of this production .
it &apos;s not a spectrum , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
our cortisol are threatened today , not because of the decline , but due to resources .
not by the latest mouth and tractor inventions , but through fruit land , not pumps , but through fresh water , not by chads , but through forests , but not through fishing , but through fish , but through fish .
you want to feed the world ?
let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that enable every community to feed themselves ?
to do that , don &apos;t look at the agricultural industry model for the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
capital , chemistry , and it has never produced a really good thing to eat .
let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
this is the one that takes back on two billion years of labor experience .
look at miguel , farmers like miguel .
businesses that are not worlds for themselves are businesses , the recreation , rather than need to be the ones that are growing , rather than just intense , farmers who are not just generating , but experts for relationships .
because they are the ones who are experts too .
and if i &apos;m really honest , you &apos;re a better chef than i am ever going to be .
you know , that &apos;s right , because when the future is good food , it will be delicious .
thank you .
if i want to get to you today , it &apos;s that the totality of the data that we consume is bigger than the sum of their parts and instead of thinking of information , and instead of trying to think of information as we can use information , that patterns would be that otherwise , that otherwise would not be visible .
so , what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical dying diagram after age .
the program i use here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called pivot and what i can do with pivot is that i can filter up after a particular cause of death .
and i immediately see a different pattern that makes it happen .
and that &apos;s because in the middle section , people are most active , and they &apos;re on the most manageable .
we can take a step further , and then we rearrange the data and see that cycle and cancer are the usual suspects , but not for everybody .
now , when we go further and look at age , we see 40 years or younger , and we see that accidents are even the main thing that people should worry about .
and who &apos;s looking forward , that &apos;s actually true of men .
so you can see that looking at information and data in this way of swimming in a living information graph .
and if we can do this for raw data , why not for content itself ?
now what we have here is the cover of every single sport illustrator , which has ever been printed .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
you might like to test it for my talk in your rooms .
with spades , you can stick in a decade .
you can dive into a particular year .
you can jump directly to a specific copy .
now , if i look here , i see the athletes that appear in this issue and the sporting species .
i &apos;m a lance armstrong fan , so i &apos;m going to show you all of the expence that lance armstrong mentioned .
now , if i want to get an enormous overview , i could think , &quot; ok , what if i look at the topic of bike ? &quot;
so i go back one step , and i &apos;ll go back to the perspective .
now i see greg lemond .
and so you get an idea of this , that if you look through this kind of information , more targeted , broader , zoom , zoom out , you don &apos;t just look at it or just not just .
you do something that is actually a little different .
it &apos;s something between and we think it changes the way information can be used .
now i want to make this idea a little bit further about what &apos;s crazy .
what we &apos;ve done here is we &apos;ve taken every single wiki of wikipedia and reduced them into a small summary .
the summary has a short overview and a symbol for the area that comes from .
i just show the top 500 of the popular penguins .
but even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things .
we immediately get a sense of the issues that are popular at wikipedia .
i &apos;m going to choose the subject of government .
now , after i chose the government , i realized that the wiki pricing , the most part of the year , are &quot; people of the year . &quot;
this is really important , because this is a realization that is not in a single wiki .
it &apos;s just to recognize if you take a step back and look at the whole .
on a particular one of these summaries , i can go into the theme magazine of time magazine , and all together .
now , if i look at all these people , i understand that the majority of the government are facing . some of them come from science . some , even less , come from the economy . here &apos;s my boss . and one comes from music .
and interestingly , bono &apos;s also a ted prize winner .
so we can jump and look at all the ted prize winners .
you see , we surfing in the net as though it &apos;s really a net , not just from side , but much more abstract .
and so i want to show you what a little surprise might be .
i &apos;m just showing you the new york times website .
pivot , this application -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not a browser , but you can look at websites -- and we can bring this shot to every single website like this .
so i can go back one step , and immediately jump to a specific section .
so this is important because you just look at the websites from the websites in this way , and look at the whole internet trajectory .
so i can zoom into my course in a particular time frame .
here &apos;s the state of the whole demonstration i &apos;ve been holding up here .
and i can kind of look at what i &apos;ve looked at today .
and , again , if i took a step out and look at everything , i could rearrange my course for my future past . here , i looked for the nepotistic , right here , or here to live labs , or here , to live labs .
and from here i can go into the page and call it again .
it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s used over and over again , and every time makes it bigger as the sum of the files .
right now , in this world , we think that data is a flight .
we talk about the curse of information .
we &apos;re talking about drowning in information .
what if we could turn this situation around and put the internet on the head , so that instead of going from one to the other , we start to go from many things to many things that would otherwise be hidden ?
if we can do this , then we get these past data , maybe a new source of information .
and , instead of just moving into information , we can know from it .
and if we know , then maybe we can even pull out of it .
that &apos;s what i hear , thank you .
i grew up with a peer portion of science fiction .
in my high school , i went to school with the bus every day .
and my nose used to put in a book , a science fiction book , which led my thoughts to other worlds , and in a way , my deep , deep curiosity .
this curiosity also showed that i was always , when i was not in school through the forests , went through the forests , and they collected , &quot; samples , frogs and snakes and beetles and ponds , everything from the microscope . &quot;
i was totally thrilled , you know .
it was always about trying to understand the world and to explore the boundaries of the possible .
and my love to science fiction seemed to be in my environment , because , in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and we explored the deep sea .
jacques cousteau came into our living rooms with his fascinating shows that showed us animals and places and a world of wonder that we never imagined before .
well , that &apos;s really good at the science fiction role .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and since it wasn &apos;t nor video games , there were still a video games with computer tracking movies that had all the data in the media landscape , i had to create the images in my head .
we had to , then , all of us . when we read a book when we read a book , we took the description of the exhibition and ran it on the screen in our heads .
my response to this was drawing and painting from aliens , alien worlds , robots , space ships and all that .
in class education , i was always caught by the teacher , as i was , hidden in the back textbook .
creativity had to go out somehow .
and something interesting happened . because what i was fascinated with jacques cousteaus shows was the idea of a completely unknown world on our planet itself .
certainly i would never be able to achieve an alien world with a spaceship that seemed very unlikely .
but here was a world i could actually walk on , here on earth , and it was equally fascinating and exotic like all that i had always imagined when i had read these books .
so i decided , when i was 15 , diver divers .
the only problem was that i was living in a small village in canada , 1,000 miles away from the nearest ocean .
but i didn &apos;t let myself off .
i whistled my father until finally , he had done a diving school in buffalo , new york , just on the other side of the border where we lived .
i graduated in a pool of smoking in the middle of the winter in buffalo , new york .
but the ocean , the real ocean , was only two years later , when we moved to california .
since then , in the 40 years , i &apos;ve been spending about three and a half hours of water , and 500 hours of it in submerbles .
and i &apos;ve learned that the deep world of the deep sea , even in the flat oceans , is so rich to fascinating lives , as we can really possibly imagine .
the idea of nature doesn &apos;t know any boundaries , unlike our own , maximum human imagination .
until today , i feel deep awe for what i see in my tracks .
and my love to the ocean is holding , with the same intensity as ever as ever .
when i first looked at a profession , it was the filmmaker .
this seemed the best way to tell my inner drive , to tell stories with my need , to unite images .
as a child , i drew a comic book book .
so films of the road were bringing together images and stories together .
of course , the stories that i was looking for was the science fiction area , &quot; terminator , &quot; &quot; aliens , &quot; and &quot; abyss . &quot;
in the abyss , i was able to do my preference for the underwater world , and that &apos;s coming to the filmmaker .
so basically , these two passions are intertwined .
something interesting happened in the abyss : to solve a narrative problem in this movie , and we had to create a kind of liquid water creature -- we moved on computer generated animation , cg , back .
and what came out of this was the first computer surprint figure that was ever seen in a movie .
the film didn &apos;t take any money , so he played his production in his production , but i noticed something fascinating : the audience on the whole world was like meserizing the magic , which went out .
according to arthur clarke &apos;s law &apos;s law , there &apos;s no more advanced technology to distinguish .
so they saw something magical .
and i found that incredibly exciting .
and i thought , &quot; wow , this must be involved in film art . &quot;
so we went in &quot; terminator 2 , &quot; my next film , even further .
together , with ilm , we created the guy from liquid metal , which is the success of that effect .
and it worked . once again , we had created something magical , and the effect in the audience was the same . but we &apos;ve played a little bit more on the movie .
from these two experiences , a whole new world was reached , a whole new world of creativity for film creativity .
so i created a company with my good friend stan winston , who was at the time of the best make-upmark and crestiation designers . she was called &quot; digital hunter . &quot;
the idea of this company was to skip the phase of analog processes with visual print , etc with , and start with digital funds .
that &apos;s what we did , and we created a competition for a while .
but in the middle of the 1990s , we realized that we were in the spature- and hunter-gatherory design -- which we actually created , in fact , to slow forward .
i wrote this piece called &quot; avatar , &quot; which was supposed to be a trivial bar in some of visual effects and computer-generated effects in new heights , with realistic human , expressive characters that were made by cg , and the main figures should be cg . and the world should be cg .
but the fourth bar was very cool , and people in my company said that we weren &apos;t able to do that .
so , i shifted that and made this other film about the big ship , which goes down .
in the movie studio , i sold this as &quot; romeo and julia on a ship . &quot; it became a love film of epic , a passionate film .
but i actually wanted to dive down to the real bow of the titanic .
that &apos;s why i did the film .
this is the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know .
i &apos;ve convinced you , by saying , &quot; we &apos;re coming to the bow . we &apos;re putting the real herck .
we &apos;re going to show it in the opening sequence of the film .
this is tremendously important . it &apos;s a good opening for marketing . &quot;
and i talked to them , to fund an expedition .
sounds crazy . but again it goes back to that that your imagination can create reality .
we actually created six months later a reality where i found myself in a russian diving boat , four miles below the surface of the north atlantic , and i was looking at the real titanic through a german eye .
it wasn &apos;t a movie , no hd , that was really .
so , that really blew my mind .
and the preparation was enormous . we had to build cameras and shell and everything .
and i noticed how much of these deep sea seats looked like a space mission .
well , they were highly technologitive and empowered .
you go up into these capsule , you go down into this dark , hostient environment , where no hope is on rescue , if you don &apos;t get back .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s just as if i was in a science fiction movie .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
i was really obsessed with the study of the deep sea .
anyway , from that part to do curiosity and science , it was all . it was adventure , it was curiosity . it was imagination .
and it was a experience that i couldn &apos;t give hollywood .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature for which we could design a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i would see outside the window .
in some of the other expeditions , i saw creatures in thermal sources , and sometimes things that i had never seen before , sometimes things that had even no one ever seen before , and for the science that science had seen before , we didn &apos;t find words yet .
so that really shocked me , and i wanted to do more .
and so i met a slightly unusual decision .
after the titanic of titanic , i said , &quot; okay , i want to put my main profession as a filmmaker in hollywood , and i &apos;m going to go for a while for a while . &quot;
and then we started , we started out to the bismarck , and they were exploring with robotic experienced witnesses .
we went back to the bow of the titanic .
we took small robots that we built , which was a fiberglass cable .
our intent was to go back and look at the inside of the ship , which had never been done before .
nobody had ever explored the inside of the neck . you didn &apos;t have any tools for it , so we developed technology .
now , i &apos;m sitting there on the deck of the titanic , in a corner boat , and i see planches that are kind of like this , and i know that the band was played there once .
and i fly with a little robotic experience of the ship .
i &apos;m really , really , but my consciousness is within the vehicle .
it felt like i was physically in the middle of the titanic of the titanic .
this was the most surorable form of a déj-vu that i &apos;ve ever experienced , because before i sit around a corner , i always knew what was going on in the light of the vehicle , because i had walked around the film .
and the set was a very accurate copy of the ship plans .
so that was a very strange experience .
it made me realize this telepresented experience that you use such robotic avatar , and so you can use your consciousness into the vehicle , in these other forms of existence .
it was really profound .
and perhaps a little look at what might happen in some decades if you have walt bodies to explore something or to do other things , in all kinds of post-humans that i can imagine as science fiction fan .
so after these expeditions , we began to learn what we had seen at the bottom , for example , for example , this deep gap where we saw this incredibly amazing animals , which is sort of alien , but here on earth .
they live with the help of chemosynthesis .
they don &apos;t exist in a base of sunlight , as we do .
and so you can see the animals who are right next to a 500 degrees centigrade that they can survive there .
at the same time , i was also very interested in space science , which was again the science fiction effect of my childhood .
and so i ended up looking at the people who are interested in space and to do with nasa , and are sitting in the nasa-building council , and they &apos;re doing right space stations , and they go to russia , they go through the mission of biomedical services , and they take our 3d camera .
that was fascinating .
but at the end of that , it was that i took space scientists into the deep sea .
i took them with them , and they gave them access to the world there : astrobiologists , planetary scientists , people who were interested in such extreme situations . i took them to the sources , so they could look around , and so on .
we made documentary films , but actually , science , more specifically , said space science .
so the circle went between my existence as a science fiction fan , as a child , and the implementation in reality .
in the course of discovery , i learned a lot .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science , but i &apos;m certainly thinking , a director needs to be able to be a leader as a ship like a ship .
but i didn &apos;t understand much about leadership before i joined this expedition .
because at a certain point , i had to say , &quot; what do i actually do here ?
why do i do that ? what is it ? &quot;
these stupid films don &apos;t give us any money .
we &apos;re just playing the production costs . none trace .
all of you think i went off &quot; titanic &quot; and &quot; avatar &quot; and &quot; avatar , &quot; and i would have laid away on a towel on a beach .
i &apos;ve all made these films , these documentary films , for a very small audience .
no glory , no honor , no money . what do you do ?
you make it for the sake of the challenge , the challenge of the ocean and the ocean is the most challenging environment that you have . you do it in the process of discovery , and because of the strange connection that creates a team of people .
because we did all this with only 10 to 12 people who have been interrupted for years , and sometimes we were two to three months on sea .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing is the warning that you have , because you can overcome a task that you can &apos;t explain anything else .
if you go back to land and say , &quot; we had to do it , the fiberglass , the speed of noise , and the whole kind of thing , the whole technology , and the difficulty , the human performance , if you work on the ocean , you can &apos;t just explain anyone to explain it .
there &apos;s a connection , a reciproent respect .
so when i got back to turn my next film &quot; avatar , &quot; i tried to use the same leadership , which is that you make your team respect and make respect to the train of respect .
it really changed the dynamics .
so i was standing back with a little team of unheard terrain . we made &quot; avatar &quot; with a new technique that didn &apos;t exist before .
incredibly exciting .
an enormous challenge .
and we became one of four and a half years into a real family .
it changed my way to make films completely .
there were people who said we did this ocean creatures really well , and on the planet of pandora .
for me , it was more understandable ways to do my job , the actual process that has changed .
so what can we get from all of this ?
what lessons do we learn ?
i think the first place is curiosity .
it &apos;s the most powerful human quality .
our imagination is a force that can actually create a reality .
and the warning of your teams is more important than all of the rest of the world .
to me , young filmmakers who say , &quot; give me a advice as i can do . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t switch yourself .
there are others for you . don &apos;t give it to yourself , don &apos;t cry against yourself , but take risks on you . &quot;
nasa has a favorite sentence , &quot; failure is not an alternative . &quot;
but in the art and exploration , failure needs to be an alternative , because there &apos;s a trust .
no major intermediate , which was innovation , became ever without risk .
you have to be willing to take risks like that .
this is the idea that i &apos;d like to share with you on the way . failure is not an alternative , but it &apos;s not . thank you .
today i &apos;m talking to you about energy and climate .
and this may surprise you , because my full-time engagement at the foundation is mostly about vaccines and seeds to make things that we have to invent and deliver the poorest 2 billion a better life .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , even more important than anyone on the planet .
climate change means that their samas are not going to grow over many years . we too much or too little hook . and things are going to change the way they can &apos;t resist their fragile environment .
that leads to hunger . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to unrest .
so , a climate change is going to be terrible for you .
the energy of energy is very important for you .
in fact , if you could only reduce the price of the price to poverty , energy would be largely effective at the most effective .
well , energy storage has fallen over time .
in fact , the progress society is based on energy advances .
the cohlerevolution drive the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a very rapid case in the electricity , and that &apos;s why we have refrigerators , we can create the modern materials , and so many things do .
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but , if we reduce the price -- let &apos;s cut the price -- we &apos;re going to go to a new barrier and that barrier depends on co2 .
co2 warming the planet and the equation for co2 is actually quite clear .
they include the equivalent of co2 , which leads to temperature increases and has a lot of these temperature increase , and effects on the weather , and maybe worse , that the natural ecosystems can &apos;t adapt to the changes that the natural ecosystems can &apos;t adapt to such a minute .
now , the exact connection between a carbon increase and the result of the sun change and where the other consequences are , there are some unknowable , but not very many .
and there &apos;s certainly ambiguity about how bad these consequences are going to be , but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad !
i &apos;ve asked the top scientists , &quot; do we really have to come down to near zero ?
isn &apos;t it enough or a quarter ? &quot;
the answer is , until we get close to zero , the temperature will increase .
so it &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different to say , we have a three-square-foot truck that has to be under a three-foot bridge , and then you can basically put it underneath .
this has to go down , zero .
well , we &apos;re entering a lot of carbon dioxide every year about 26 billion tons .
every americans about 20 tons . people from poor countries , less than one .
on average , it &apos;s about five tons for each one on the planet .
and somehow we have to bring change that &apos;s down to zero .
it has continued to have since .
only different economic changes have changed , and we have to go from rapid diving to reducing and to a reduction until zero .
this equation has four factors . a little bit multiplied . they have this thing on the left -- co2 , which they want to take out zero and depend on the number of people , depending on the number of people who are using the average , the average energy in the average energy and the co2 energy .
so let &apos;s take a look at each factor , and let &apos;s see how we get it to zero .
probably one of these numbers must come very close to zero .
now that &apos;s fundamental algebra , but let &apos;s go through it .
first we have the population .
today , 6.8 billion people live .
and it turns out to be nine billion . it turns to nine billion .
if we &apos;re very successful with new vaccine , health care , the health care system , we may be able to reduce that 10 percent to 15 percent , but at the time we see a slope around 1.3 .
the second factor is the services we use .
it &apos;s all that we eat food that we eat , clothing , tv .
these are very good things , and poverty consumption means to make these services available almost everyone on the planet .
it &apos;s great that this number goes up .
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we might be able to do less and less use , but on average , this number will increase every year and so much more than double , the number of services that are being created .
so here &apos;s a very basic service . are there a home at home , so you can read the homework ?
and these students don &apos;t have it , so they go out and read their school problems under the street .
now , efficiency , the e , the energy per service , is finally good news .
we have something that &apos;s not rising .
because of different successes in the light sector , through other halls , through new methods in building building , there are a lot of services , there are a lot of services that are going to reduce some of the services of energy .
in other services , as the manufacturing of fertilizers , 105 dood: 05 : 56,000 : 05 : 05 : 05 : 05 : 05 : 05 , or air traffic , is the play room for improvement .
in total , if we are optimistic , maybe we get a reduction for three or maybe even a factor of six or more .
but in the first three factors , we &apos;ve now gone from 26 billion to perhaps nine billion tons , and that &apos;s just not enough .
so let &apos;s take a look at the fourth factor -- and this is going to be a key factor -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 , the energy unit of energy .
the question is whether you can get it to zero .
if you burn coal , no .
if you burn natural gas : no .
almost every manufacturing method for electricity increases today , except the renewables and nuclear energy .
so , what we need to do on a global level is to create a new system .
we need energy wonders .
now if i use the term &quot; wonders , &quot; i don &apos;t mean the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the pc is a miracle .
the internet and the services is a miracle .
people here have contributed to the development of many of these miracles .
usually there is no update that you need a miracle to a certain date .
typically , you &apos;re just sitting wrong and some of them are not coming .
in this case , we have to get full gas and get a miracle in very short time .
now , i asked myself , how can i really get that out ?
is there natural commentary , a demonstration , which is the idea of people here ?
i remembered last year when i brought mosquitos and somehow liked the people .
the idea became really tangible for you , you know , there are people who live with mosquitos .
for energy , i fell there .
i decided that this was going to be clear from fireflies to the environment here .
so here &apos;s a couple of natural fireflies .
i told you that they don &apos;t bite . they probably don &apos;t even notice the glass .
well , there are all kinds of playful solutions like this , but they don &apos;t get a lot .
we need to have solutions , either one or a half of them have an unconsistent scaling and unimaginable imperative , and even though there are many directions where people are looking for them , i really see five who can afford these big demands .
i &apos;ve left out , geographic , fusion and biofuel .
this may be a moderate contribution , and if you do better than i expect , that &apos;s great , but my core statement here is that we have to work on all five , and we can &apos;t give up because they all have significant problems .
let &apos;s first look at burning fossil fuels , burning from either coal or natural gas .
what you have to do is , maybe it &apos;s just , but it &apos;s not . you &apos;ve got to do all that co2 that comes from the burning out of the burning , catching up under pressure , and then places and hope that it stays there .
there are some mushroom projects that do that on a 60 percent -- 80 percent level , but to get to 100 percent , it &apos;s going to be very difficult , and an agreement for the laction of co2 is a big challenge , but the biggest problem here is a big challenge .
who will make it secure ?
who can guarantee something that literally many billion times greater than any kind of waste you can imagine from nuclear and other things ?
that &apos;s a lot of volume .
so this is a tough one .
next , nuclear energy .
it also has three big problems . the cost of the cost is in highly temperated countries . the question for security is that you really feel that nothing can go wrong , despite the human being , that the fuel is not used for weapons .
and then what do you do with the waste ?
because even though it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concerns .
so three very difficult problems that might be soluble , and that &apos;s why you should work .
the last three of the five , i put in .
it &apos;s the renewables of how they &apos;re often called .
and also , even though it &apos;s great that they don &apos;t need fuel -- they have some subsections .
one is energy energy that makes these technologies dramatically lower than power stations .
these are the power of energy , you talk about many square miles , tens of thousands of times as a normal power plant .
and also , these sources underend .
the sun doesn &apos;t seem to be the whole day , it doesn &apos;t seem that every day , and it doesn &apos;t seem to be the wind all the time .
so , if you have to depend on these sources , you have to have a way to have energy in times if you &apos;re not available to get .
so there &apos;s a big price of challenges here . there are challenges on transmission , and if we say that the energy source of the country is , they don &apos;t just need the technology to come from where the energy comes from .
and there &apos;s the background problem .
and to show the dimension , i &apos;ve all made all kinds of batteries that are made to look at : the cars , computers , mobile phones , poping lights , for everything . and that &apos;s what i found with the amount of electronic energy that uses the world that we &apos;re producing now , less than 10 minutes . i found out that all batteries that we produce are going to produce .
so we need a big breakthrough here , something that is going to be 100 better than the approaches to the time .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
this is what happens when you try to make these substellary sources about 20 percent of the users .
if you want to support about 100 percent , you need an incredible miracle battery .
now , where are we going to go , what is the real approach ?
an manhattan project ? how do we get to the target ?
what we need is a lot of companies that work on this . hundreds .
in each one of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
they &apos;re going to say , they &apos;re crazy ! that &apos;s good .
i think there &apos;s a lot of people here in the ted group who are already getting involved there .
bill great has several companies , among other people called esolar technologies .
vinle-khosla invest in dozens of companies doing the great stuff and have interesting opportunities and i try to support it .
nathan myhrvold and i fund a company , which is , perhaps surprisingly , the nuclear approach .
there are some innovations in the nuclear field ; wiser , liquid .
the development has stopped in this industry some time , so it &apos;s not a big surprise that some good concepts are around .
the terraknife concept means that instead of a part of the uranium , the one percent , the 2235 , we decided to burn the 99 percent .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , you &apos;ve been thinking about it for a long time , but you could never simulate any reasonable , whether it &apos;s going to work , but since then there &apos;s modern supercomputer , you can simulate it and see that , yes , there it is .
and because you burn these 99 percent , it &apos;s a very much better cost .
in fact , you burn the waste , and you can even use the waste of the today &apos;s reactors .
instead of breaking your head , you just burn it . a great thing .
the uran is used , a little bit like a candle .
you can see that it &apos;s a kind of pillar , often called &quot; passenger wave reactor . &quot;
that really solves the fuel problem .
here &apos;s a picture of a place in kentucky .
this is the waste , the 99 percent . you have the part that &apos;s being burned today , so it &apos;s made up of a brick .
the motors for hundreds of years .
and if you look at ocean water , you just get enough fuel for the rest of the planet .
you know , there &apos;s a lot of challenges , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to get forward .
let &apos;s think of how we should measure our success .
how should our testimony look ?
now , let &apos;s go to the destination that we have to reach and then we talk about the interextinction .
many talk from one 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
it &apos;s really important that we get there .
the rest of the 20 percent will be produced in poor countries , and still something agriculture is going to be , hopefully , a bit of agriculture .
so , to reach these 80 percent , the industrialized states , including countries like china , are completely refiguring out their electricity generation .
the other note says whether we &apos;re using the zero emissions technology , whether it &apos;s used in all developed countries and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest .
that &apos;s great .
this is going to be a key element of this .
if we go back there , how should that be in 2020 ?
it should contain the two elements .
we should use the effects of influence to get reduction on the way , and the less we are , the less we are going to be the source of co2 , and it &apos;s also going to be the temperature .
but actually , this note for the things that we &apos;re doing , which are not completely reductions , is just the same , or even something less important than the other which is the speed of innovation for these breakthroughs .
we need to follow these breakthroughs with full gas , and we can measure it : in corporate numbers , in mushroom projects and regulation changes .
there are many great books to this issue .
the al gore &apos;s book &quot; we have the choice &quot; and david mckays , &quot; opium energy therapist . &quot;
they really go through and create a framework that can be discussed , because we need to support all of the pages .
there &apos;s a lot to come together .
that &apos;s a wish .
a very concrete wish that we invent this technology .
if you just gave me a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a vaccine , and the love i could choose , or i could choose that wish , which is , you know , halzed energy storage .
this has the largest effect .
if we don &apos;t get that wish , the dig is going to be terrible between the long-term and short-term imaginous people , between the united states and china , between poor and rich state and almost all of those two billion will be a lot worse .
so what do we need to do ?
what kind of action do i call ?
we need to use more research for more research .
when countries meet in places like copenhagen , they shouldn &apos;t just talk about co2 .
you should talk to these innovation strategy , and you would be shocked by the ridiculous little stuff that will be spent for these innovative approaches .
we need market incentives , carbon taxes , cap &amp; amp ; trade is something that creates a price signal .
we need to spread the message .
we need to rationalize dialogue and the full things that are done by government .
it &apos;s an important wish , but i think we can fulfill it .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you very much . just to understand terrapower something better -- first , you can give us an idea of scale of the investment ?
bill gates : to do the simulation on a supercomputer , all major scientists , what we &apos;ve done , we just need some 10 million . and even if we have tested our materials in a russian reactor , to make sure that it works , you know , it &apos;s rational , you &apos;re just in the 100 million .
the difficult step is to build the first reactor , to find another billion , the normal athletes and the place of actually building the first of it .
as soon as the first thing is done , when it goes like this , it &apos;s all very clear , because the economy , the energy agency is so different from nuclear energy as we know it .
to understand the right thing : to build deep in the soil almost like a vertical column nuclear fuel , and then , the process is going to start , and then the process continues to go down ?
bg : right . now , you &apos;ve got to refill the reactor , so there &apos;s a lot of people and lots of controls that can go wrong . this thing where you open it and put things in -- that &apos;s not good !
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can put it for 60 years -- think about a column -- they &apos;re buried without all the complexity .
and it &apos;s sitting there for 60 years and then it &apos;s done .
a nuclear reactor that gives itself a solution to the garbage .
bg : yeah . now , what happens to the waste : you can let him sit -- there &apos;s a lot less waste with this method -- you take it and put it in the next reactor .
and we start by taking the waste that exists already in these refrigerators , or dry half of the reactors , which is our starting fuel .
so that &apos;s what &apos;s been a problem for these reactors , which is what we &apos;re going to do in our fill and make the waste dramatically dramatically during the process .
but as they talk to various people around the world , they &apos;ve been talking about these possibilities .
where &apos;s the biggest interest , what really do ?
bg : now we haven &apos;t been set up to a place , and there &apos;s a lot of more interesting rules for everything that is &quot; nuclear &quot; in the name . there are big interest and people of the company in russia , india , china -- i was here and talked about the energy agenda .
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have something in the direction .
this is a version of one thing that was made .
this is an important step forward , but it &apos;s like a faster reactor and some countries built that , so everyone who has done a fast reactor , a candidate for our first .
in your imagination , timeline and probability is something really to really live ?
bg : now we need one of these scaling , distributed things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to invent and then for 20 years .
this is sort of the update that shows us the environmental models that we need to keep .
and , you know , terrapower , if everything goes well , and that &apos;s a big wish , could hold that easy .
and fortunately , there are dozens of companies today , and we need hundreds , the same , if their approaches work , working for their pilots , can be able to do it .
and it would be best if there were several , because then you could use a mixture .
anyway , we need a solution .
so , the big breakthroughs , is this the biggest thing you know ?
bg : an energy breakthrough is the most important .
it would have been without the environmentalism , but the power is so much more important .
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
you know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as these , but there are these patterns that are different .
there &apos;s a liquid retorype , which seems to be a little bit difficult , but maybe the people say that .
and so there are different , but the beautiful thing is that a catanmolecule has a million times as much energy as one , say , a coal molecule , and therefore , if you can deal with the problems and the things that are the potential , the impact is the potential , so the impact on the land and the other things , so the impact is the potential , so the effect of the land , and the cost of the rest of the world .
if that doesn &apos;t work , then what ?
do we need to guide emergency action to try and keep it stable ?
bg : when you get to this situation , it &apos;s as if you &apos;re eating too much , and you have a heart attack . what do you do ? you might need a heart surgery or something .
there &apos;s a research of research called geoengineering , which deals with different techniques to delay warming , so that we will spend 20 or 30 years longer .
this is just an insurance method .
you hope that we don &apos;t need that .
some people say you &apos;re not supposed to work on insurance , because you may not have a good power , so that you &apos;re going to eat , because you know that you &apos;re going to save the heart surgery .
i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s smart , if you look at the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s now a discourse in geoengineering about whether you should have that , if the things are getting faster , if you expect it to happen .
climate change : do you have one or two sentences for you maybe to convince you ?
bg : well , unfortunately , the skeptics live in very different camps .
those who do scientific arguments are very little .
do you say there are negative impacts that have to do with the clouds that move things ?
there are very , very few things that you can even tell , which is a chance in a million .
the main problem here is similar to aids .
you make the mistake now , and you pay a lot later .
and that &apos;s why the idea is , now , if you have all kinds of problems to invest in something that you have just later -- and comes to the fact that the investment is not so clear . in fact , the ipcc report is not necessarily the worst case , and there &apos;s people in the rich world .
the fact is that these uncertainty should make us worry .
but my dream here is , if you can do it economically , and at the same time , the co2 will say , &quot; okay , it doesn &apos;t matter to me that it &apos;s not a carbon degree , i wish it &apos;s not going to be any carbon . &quot;
and that would be your answer to the bjn lomborg argument , that if you use all this time and energy to solve the co2 problem , all the other goals suffer from the poverty , the poverty reduction , the poverty reduction from malaria and so on .
bg : well , the actual spending for research -- let &apos;s say the u.s. to spend 10 billion a year more than they do today -- that &apos;s not so dramatic .
it shouldn &apos;t suffer other things .
you get to big sums of money , and here you can talk reasonable people when you have something that &apos;s not economically , and trying to finance it . most of the waste is happening .
it is , you know , you &apos;re very short about a cost of free and funded only the learning curve . i think we should try more things that have the potential to be much cheaper .
if the slope you get is a very high energy storage , you can only get the rich stay .
i mean , each of us here could spend five times as much for our energy without changing its lifestyle .
for the lower two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
and even lomborg is thinking .
his new magy is now , &quot; why don &apos;t the research be discussed anymore ? &quot;
he &apos;s still being associated , because of his former stories , with the skepticism camp , but he understood that this is a very real group , and therefore he gets the research test .
and that &apos;s a thought that i think is appropriate .
research , it &apos;s just crazy how little it is supporting .
bill , i think i &apos;m going to talk for almost all people here when i say i really hope you will be true . thank you very much .
bg : thank you .
a few years ago , here at ted , peter skillman hired a design competition called &quot; the marshmallow challenge . &quot;
the idea is pretty simple . four teams need to open the biggest possible possible structure with 20 spaghetti tape , about 110 tape tape , and a marshmallow .
the marshmallow needs to be on top .
and , although it really seems to be , it &apos;s really hard to work , because it &apos;s very quick to work .
and so i thought that this is an interesting idea , and i &apos;ve turned it into a design workshop .
it was a huge success .
since then , i &apos;ve done about 70 workshops worldwide around the world , with students , developers and architects , even with ctos of fortune of fortune , and there &apos;s something that makes deep sensions in nature , and i want to share with you some of them .
usually most people start acting on the task .
you talk about how it &apos;s going to look , you &apos;re thinking about it .
then they invest a little bit in planning and organization . they draw and put spaghetti .
they invest most of their time in the combined structure .
and finally , before you don &apos;t have time , someone takes the marshmallow and you put it on top of the top , step back , step back and &quot; ta-da . &quot;
but then , almost always , what happens is that the ta-da &quot; uh-&quot; becomes a &quot; uh-&quot; because the weight of the marshmallow is that the whole thing is expanding and closing .
there &apos;s a number of people who have much more &quot; uh-oh &quot; moments than others , and under the worst are fresh .
they lie , they &apos;re cheating , they &apos;re confused and they &apos;re really producing dbows .
and of course , there are teams that have a lot more &quot; ta-da &quot; data , and under the best they have fresh graduate students .
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
as peter says , they don &apos;t just tell the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
what you might be asking is : how is this ? why ? what about those ?
and peter says , &quot; no one of the kids spend time in their head of spaghetti gmbh . &quot;
they don &apos;t invest in power combat .
but there &apos;s another reason .
and that is that bwle student was trained to find a proper plan , ok !
and then to realize it .
then what happens when you put the marshmallow on top , you don &apos;t have time , and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
what children do is they &apos;re starting to start with the marshmallow and build prototypes , successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow at the top , so they have the ability to repair the possibility of the sun .
constructive recognize this kind of collaboration as the core of a iterative process .
and with every trial , the kids get directly feedback and what &apos;s not .
so the power of working with prototypes is a lot more -- but let &apos;s see how different teams act .
the average for most of you is about 50 inches , bwl-students creating half of them , lawyers are doing something more , but not much , children &apos;s garden kids are better than adults .
who is most successful ?
architects and engineers , fortunately .
elm is the highest thing i saw .
and why ? because they understand triangles and self-self-replication geometric patterns are key structures to build the key structures .
ceo is something about average . but here it gets interesting .
you put an external administrator on the team , you get significant better .
it &apos;s incredible . you look around and you see , &quot; this team will win . &quot;
you can predict that . why is that ?
because they have special skills of processing .
they run the process , they understand it .
and this team , the law and the work that &apos;s going to pay attention to the work of the team is significantly improving .
specialized skills and processor skills and their combination leads to success .
if you have 10 teams that are typical , you get about six , you get more stable structures .
i tried something very exciting .
i thought , you know , we &apos;ll get the pokering .
so i offered 10,000 dollars of software for the winners .
what do you think happened to these design students ?
what was the outcome ?
this happened . not a team had a stable structure .
if anyone built an 2.5inch tall engineering , he would have carried the price home .
so , isn &apos;t it interesting that high competition have a strong effect ?
we repeated this exercise with the same students .
what do you think happened now ?
now they understood the benefit of the prototyping .
so from the same , bad team of one under the best .
they produced the highest construction in the least time .
so there &apos;s so profound clarity for us to talk about nature of drive and success .
you might ask : why would somebody actually invest a marshmallow challenge ?
and the reason is to create digital tools and processes to help create teams , cars , video games and &quot; visual hunter . &quot;
and what the marshmallow challenge is , it helps you to identify assumptions .
because frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge is a shared experience , a common language , or basic posture , to build the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , this so simple exercise .
and those of you who are interested in it can go to a cocktail troll .
it &apos;s a blog where you can see how to build the marshmallow .
there &apos;s a pac-by-step manual there .
they find crazy examples of all the world , how people optimize the system and optimize them .
there are also world leaders .
and the base lesson , i think , is actually the construction of exercise .
it requires that we &apos;re all doing our senses , and that we &apos;re using our thinking optimal , like our emotions and our , in the challenge , the challenge of us .
and sometimes a little prototype of this experience is everything it takes to get us from a &quot; uh-&quot; moment .
and that can make a difference .
thank you .
so let &apos;s have a machine here .
a big machine , a cool , ted machine , and that &apos;s a time machine .
and everyone in this room has to come in .
and you can go into the past , you can go into the future ; you can &apos;t stay in here and now .
and i wonder what they would choose because i asked my friends in the last time , and they wanted to go to the past .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back to time before there was a car or twitter or america .
i don &apos;t know .
i believe you &apos;ve somehow moved to the nostalgia , you know .
and i understand that .
i &apos;m not part of that group , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to go to the past , and that &apos;s not because i &apos;m an adventcator .
it &apos;s because possibilities don &apos;t go back , they go forward .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go to the future .
this is the greatest time that we have ever on this planet , no matter what they &apos;re doing , health , wealth , mobility , opportunities , singing diseases .
there was never a time like this .
my great-great-grandparents died when they were 60 .
my grandparents pushed this number to 70th .
my parents are the 80-lows .
so there should be a nine at the beginning of my death number .
but it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is a larger thing than that .
a child who is born today in new delhi can expect to live as long as the richest man in the world 100 years ago .
think about it . this is an incredible fact .
and why is that ?
smallpox . smallpox has killed billions of people on this planet .
you &apos;ve reformed the demographics of the earth in a way that no war has ever done .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
we &apos;ve forced them . puff .
in the rich world , diseases that have millions of us are still threatened by one generation , hardly yet .
diphmage , the roman paralysis ...
anybody still knows what that is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , are successes of scientific method .
and from my view , the scientific method is to try and look at things , if it works , it changes if it doesn &apos;t , one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
so that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , it &apos;s all the good news , because there &apos;s a few other problems , and they &apos;ve been often mentioned .
and one of them is that despite all our achievements , all of our achievements in the world are hungry every day .
this number goes up , and it goes very quickly , and that &apos;s shame .
and not only that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to overcome this world .
water , ancient land , rainforests , oil , gas : they disappear , and if we don &apos;t get out of this chaos , we &apos;re going to go out and get out of that mess too .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think it &apos;s .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that will feed billions of people , without the country that they live on .
i think we can power this world with energy that doesn &apos;t even ruin it at the same time .
i think that really , and no , that &apos;s not a wonderful idea .
but this is what keeps me awake at night -- one of the things that keep me awake at night . we &apos;ve never needed scientific progress as well .
and we &apos;ve never been able to put it in the way that we can do it today .
we &apos;re on the verge to amazing , amazing events in many places , and yet i really think we need to go back hundreds and 300 years before the enlightenment , to find a time where we have been fighting progress , in which we have these kinds of things .
people wake up in their faith , and that &apos;s how closely they can &apos;t release them .
not even the truth will release them .
and listen , everyone has a right to think about it ; even one right to his opinion of progress .
but you know what you &apos;re not right about ?
you don &apos;t have a right to your own facts . &apos; &quot; to join , you don &apos;t . &quot;
and i took a while to find out that .
about a decade ago , i wrote an article about vaccination for &quot; the new yorker , &quot; a little article .
and i was amazed to go to resistance , on resistance against what is the most effective possible activity in the history of mankind .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i just did what i always do , i wrote a paper and drove out .
and soon , i wrote an article about genetic food .
the same thing , just bigger .
people were playing crazy .
so i wrote an article about this , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that , &quot; frankenfood , &quot; why they thought molecules were going to move into a particular part of the nature of nature .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
we type , we &apos;re rich , we &apos;re eating , that &apos;s okay .
but this article made me worry , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and finally , i found it .
and that &apos;s because these fanatics who were making me crazy at all were no fanatics .
these were people , educated people , inconsistent people .
they were just like the people in this room .
and that brought me so confused .
but then i thought , you know what , be honest .
we &apos;re at a point where we don &apos;t have the same ratio to progress as we used to .
we &apos;re talking about twin .
we &apos;re talking ironic about this , which is , &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , there &apos;s reasons , and i think we know what causes this .
we have trust in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science , and there &apos;s no reason why it shouldn &apos;t be that way .
you can just name a couple of names and people will understand .
chernobyl , bhopal , the challenger , vioxx , mass weapons , the u.s. presidential election 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with people we thought they were always right . so be skeptical .
ask questions , ask the evidence , demand evidence .
don &apos;t take anything for granted .
but now it &apos;s : if you have to get evidence you &apos;ve got to take this evidence , and we &apos;re not good at it .
and i can say that we now live in an epidemic of fear , as i &apos;ve never seen before , and hopefully never see it again .
about 12 years ago , a story was published , a terrible story , which was the autism epidemic with the masens , muop , and roman vaccine in connection .
very scary .
in fact , studies were done to see if that was true .
in fact , studies should be done ; that &apos;s a serious matter .
the data came in .
the data came in from the united states , from england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all alike , no correlation , no correlation .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference . it doesn &apos;t make any difference , because we believe in anecdotes , we believe what we see , what we see , what causes us to feel really .
we don &apos;t believe in a group of a government that gives us data , and i understand that i think we all do .
but you know what ?
the result of this was catastrophic .
protehal because of this fact : the united states is one of the only countries in the world where the impcrazation goes down .
this is scandal and we should be ashamed .
it &apos;s terrible .
what happened is we could do that .
well , i understand that . i do .
because there &apos;s somebody here ?
has one in the audience ever saw anyone die of masers ?
it doesn &apos;t happen very often .
it &apos;s not happening in this country , but 160,000 times in the world last year .
these are a lot of deaths through maskers , 20 an hour .
but because it &apos;s not happening here , we can put it in denial , and people like jenny mccarthy can walk around and messages from fear and illiteracy and larry king .
and they can do that because they don &apos;t connect the cause and correlation .
you don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be equal , but almost never are the same .
and that &apos;s something we need to learn , and it &apos;s very quick .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .
he liberated us from one of the worst things of humanity .
no fear , no source , child paralysis , puff , disappeared .
the guy in the middle not so much .
it &apos;s called paul offit .
he has just developed a couple of other people &apos;s vaccine .
he can save the lives of 400- , 500,000 children a year in the developing world .
pretty good , isn &apos;t it ?
well , that &apos;s good , except that paul runs around and talks about vaccines and says how valuable you are , and that people should just stop jambers .
and he actually says that .
so paul is a terrorist terrorist .
when paul is speaking in a public reading , he can &apos;t do without armed weapons .
he gets calls at home because people like to tell him that they know where to go to school .
and why ? because paul did a vaccine .
i don &apos;t need that , but vaccines are unreductable .
you take them away , the diseases go back , terrible diseases , and this is happening .
we have now masen in this country .
and that gets worse , and pretty soon kids will die again because that &apos;s just a question of numbers .
and they &apos;re not just going to die .
what about paralysis ? let &apos;s do this . why not ?
a comet of mine wrote me a couple of weeks ago , and i think i &apos;m a little bit like a shrimp .
nobody ever said that .
she wouldn &apos;t vaccinate her child for children &apos;s paralysis . no .
fine .
why ? because we don &apos;t have children &apos;s paralysis , and you know what ?
we didn &apos;t have children &apos;s paralysis yesterday .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe somebody in lagos came to an airplane and flies to los angeles , right now , he &apos;s about ohio .
and in a few hours he lands , and he rented a car , and he comes to long beach , and he &apos;s going to visit one of these fantastic ted hans tonight tonight .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with an injured disease , and we don &apos;t know , because that &apos;s how the world works now .
this is the planet that we live on . don &apos;t do it as if it &apos;s not .
we love jumping in lies . we love that .
did you all take their vitamins tomorrow ?
echinacea , a little antioxidicture that helps you to get on the jumps .
i know they did that because half the americans do it every day .
they take the stuff , and they take alternative cure , and it doesn &apos;t make any difference how often we find that they &apos;re useless .
the data shows that all the time .
they evaporate their urine . they almost never do .
that &apos;s okay , you want to be like 28 billion dollars for dark ine numbers .
i agree with you completely .
dark ine . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
well , i think i understand -- we hate the pharmaceutical industry .
we hate too strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
and that &apos;s not what we should do . our healthcare system is mies .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely amazing to us , and sea caps can afford to do it .
so we &apos;re walking away , and where do we go ?
we run into the arms of placebo industry .
that &apos;s great . i love the placebo industry .
but you know , that &apos;s really serious matter , because the stuff is crap , and we spend billions of dollars for it .
and i have all kinds of props here .
kone of them -- vancouver , cheating , echinacea , cheating , acai , i don &apos;t even know what that is , but we spend billions of dollars for it , it &apos;s cheating .
and you know what ? when i say that , people scream me and say , &quot; what do you care ? let &apos;s do what you want .
so they feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? you have wrong .
because i don &apos;t care whether it &apos;s the minister of health , which says , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m not going to take the evidence of my experts to mammography , &quot; or any cancer source that wants to treat his patients with caffe-eindds .
if you go to that path , where and magic and magic and science replace , you get to a place where you don &apos;t want to be .
they get to thabo mbeki in south africa .
he brought out 400,000 of his people because he was the fact that red beelines , the bones and the quoted oil , are much more effective than antiretroviral drugs that we know that they can stop the course of aids .
hundreds of thousands of imembodied deaths in a country that will be worse than any other of these disease .
don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences .
they have them . they always have them .
well , the brain loseest epidemic , where we are right now , is this kind of absurd fight between the fear of the local food and the bioelite .
this is an idiotic debate . it has to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
this is ideology , not science .
everything we eat , each of the latcs , every branch , every branch , was changed by the people .
you know , there were no mandations in paradise .
there was no cantrouds melons .
there was no christmas trees . we did all this .
we did it over the last 1,000 years .
and some of it has worked and it doesn &apos;t work .
we &apos;ve become , what didn &apos;t work .
now we can do it more closely , and of course , there are risks , but we can do something like vitamin a in rice , and the stuff can help people extend millions of people .
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
i have to say that i don &apos;t understand .
we dismiss food .
why do we do that ?
now , what i &apos;m listening to is too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , monoculture , we don &apos;t want huge fields with one thing that is wrong .
we don &apos;t want companies patent .
we don &apos;t want companies to own seeds .
and you know what my answer to all this is ?
yes , they &apos;re right . we fix that .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge food problem , but it &apos;s not science .
it has nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s quite , morality , patent stuff .
you know that science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work , but the idea that we should not allow science to do , because we &apos;re afraid of doing a really dead , and it holds millions of people from the flourishing .
you know , in the next 50 years we &apos;ll have to grow 70 percent more food than at the moment . 70 percent .
this investment in africa over the last 30 years .
shame . shame .
they need that , and we don &apos;t give it to them .
and why ? genetically changed food .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this fine stuff like maniok .
maniok is something that half a billion people eat .
it &apos;s like a mapping .
it &apos;s just a bunch of calories . it &apos;s mies .
it has no nutrients , it doesn &apos;t have protein , and scientists are building all this .
and then people could eat the food and they wouldn &apos;t be blinded .
they wouldn &apos;t starve , and you know what ?
that would be beautiful . it wouldn &apos;t be the editor , but it would be beautiful .
and all i can say about this is : why do we fight this ?
i mean , let &apos;s say , why do we fight this ?
because we don &apos;t want to push genes around ?
it &apos;s not about push genes around . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our defenses on greater food , better food , better food .
it &apos;s not about rice genomics , it &apos;s about getting people alive , and it &apos;s going to be the highest time to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we don &apos;t do that , if we &apos;re going to do that , we &apos;re going to be guilty about something that we don &apos;t want to be guilty about , i don &apos;t want to be guilty , high-tech colonialism .
there &apos;s no other description of what &apos;s happening here .
it &apos;s self-addictive , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s not worthy , and we have to really stop it .
so after this incredibly funny conversation , you might want to say , &quot; are you still going to go into this ridiculous machine and in the future ? &quot;
anyway . i definitely want .
right now in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can put this time machine on everything we want .
we can move them where we want to move , and we &apos;re going to move them where we want .
we need to have these conversations , and we need to think , but when we go to the time machine , we &apos;ll be happy to have that .
i know we can , and as far as it &apos;s in me , that &apos;s something that the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
so for some time , i &apos;ve been interested in placebo effect , and it may seem strange that a magician cares about it , it &apos;s like , you look at it as i &apos;m saying , &quot; a deception that &apos;s going to be something that &apos;s going to be true when someone thinks about it enough . &quot;
in other words , sugar pills have shown a measurement effect in some studies , the placebo effect , and it &apos;s just because the person thinks what &apos;s going on with you is a pharmaceutical or a kind of ... in the pain management , for example , there is , if the patient is only aware of it , there &apos;s a measurable effect in the body .
a deception is going to be something , because someone is so empowered .
so , in order for us to understand each other , i want to show you a fundamental , simple magic trick .
and i &apos;m going to show you how it works . this is a trick that has at least since the 1950s in the 1950s for children .
i learned it from the cub scout magic of the paths in the 1970s .
i &apos;m going to do it for you and then explain him .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i explain it .
so , look what happens .
the knife you can study , my hand you can study .
i &apos;ll just keep the knife in my bad way .
i get my sleeve back .
and to make sure that nothing in my sleeve or out of it , i &apos;ll just push my wrist right here .
in this way , you can see that there &apos;s no time to move anything . as long as i push up here , nothing can come out of my sleeve .
and the goal is very simple .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully , if everything goes well , the knife is listed by my physical magnetic magnetic magnetism .
it &apos;s actually sitting in the middle of his place that i can shake it without the knife .
nothing comes out of my sleeve or comes out , no hypothetical . and you can study everything .
ta-da !
now , this is a trick i often bring to young kids who are interested in magic , because you can learn a lot about deception when you look closely , even though it &apos;s a very simple trick .
probably many of you in the room know this trick .
it works like this .
i think the knife in my hand .
i say i close my wrist to make sure that nothing in my sleeve or out , and that &apos;s a lie .
the reason i reversed my wrist is that it is the real secret of illusion .
at the moment , where i turned my hand away from you so that you can see it from behind , this finger is moving , my time finger , just from where he was , in a position where he was so extended .
great trick ?
there &apos;s someone behind that there &apos;s no childhood .
so , he &apos;s here . right .
and when i turn around , the finger changes his position .
and now you could talk about why this is a deception , why you don &apos;t realize that there are only three fingers down here : because the mind and the way it processes information , it doesn &apos;t count , one , two , three , but it looks as a group .
but that &apos;s not really what it is here . and then i open my hand .
of course , it &apos;s held there , but not by the magnets of my body , but through a trick , through my own fingers , which is now there .
and if i close my hand , the same thing happens by turning me back through this movement , that the finger will move back again .
i take this hand away . and here &apos;s the knife .
this trick can show you your friends and neighbors . thank you .
now , what does this have to do with placebo effect ?
a year ago , i read a study that really got me right .
i &apos;m not a doctor or a scientist , and that &apos;s why it was an amazing thing to me .
and what it turns out is , if you offer a placebo form of a white pill , in the form of an arranged , it &apos;s just a round , white pill that has a particular measurement effect .
but if you look at the shape where you &apos;re going to change the placebo , for example , in a smaller pill , and the blue color and a letter on it is actually measurable .
and that , although not any pharmaceutical ... it &apos;s just sugar pills .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
what ? it really got me off .
but it turns out that it &apos;s not all .
when you take heaps , it &apos;s more effective than a pill .
a colored capsule , which is at a end of yellow and the other red , is better than a white capsule .
also the dosage plays a role .
a pill twice a day is not as good as three pills -- i can &apos;t remember the exact statistics . sorry .
but the key thing is , ...
... that the dosizations also play a role .
and the shape plays a role .
and if you want to have the ultimate placebo effect , you need to reach the needle .
right ? a syringe with an effective -- a few milliseconds of an effective substance that you can inject a patient .
it creates a very strong picture in your head , which is a lot stronger than a white ball .
this chart is really -- i &apos;m going to show you another time , if we have a projector .
so the fact is that the white pill doesn &apos;t seem as good as the blue pill that doesn &apos;t seem as good as a capsule , which doesn &apos;t seem like the needle .
and none of it has some really pharmaceutical property . it &apos;s just our faith that we have a stronger impact .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
i &apos;ll take something that &apos;s obviously a deception , and let it look real .
we know from the study that you have to reach to the needle if it &apos;s supposed to go .
this is an 18-inch breath . she &apos;s very , very high , and i &apos;m going to take you a little bit of a bit of a parachute .
this is really my flesh . it &apos;s not raw meat .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood .
i &apos;m now going to stick this needle into my skin and drive through them through the other side .
if you &apos;re a bad thing -- if you &apos;re just in an oimpower -- i got a couple of friends last night in the hotel room , and some people i didn &apos;t know , and a woman has become almost oimpowerful .
so i &apos;m suggesting if you &apos;re going to get serious , then you look for the next 30 seconds , or , you know what , i &apos;m going to make the first marriage part of this back .
you can see it right now , but you can see , you can see .
so , this is , right here , where my flesh starts , at the bottom of my arm , i &apos;m just going to make a little dislet .
i &apos;m really sorry . does it make you crazy ?
and just a little bit of a little bit of my skin and on the other side .
now we &apos;re actually in the same situation that we had with the measuring trick .
about it .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
so , i &apos;m going to show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well .
i know what people think when they see this .
they say , &quot; okay , that &apos;s not so stupid , that &apos;s not so stupid , just to talk to us a few minutes . &quot;
well , i &apos;ll show you .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and the people in the back say , &quot; okay . i don &apos;t see that right . &quot;
people in the side rooms are now coming in .
let me show you from the close .
this is really my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood .
that &apos;s my flesh , and i can rotate around .
sorry . if you &apos;re bad , look away , don &apos;t look .
the people at the back , or the one that would look at the video later , will say , &quot; well , yeah , this is what it looks like , but if it &apos;s real , it would be a hole , and if it really would be real , it would be blooded . &quot;
okay , let me just illuminate some blood for you .
yeah , here it is .
usually i would take the needle out .
i would make my arm clean and show you that there are no wounds .
but i think in this framework here , and with the intention of being a deception , i &apos;m going to just make a needle in there , and i &apos;ll just leave the stage .
we &apos;re going to see a couple of times in the next few days .
i hope you &apos;re enjoying it . thank you .
everybody talks about happiness today .
i have some people counting the number of books that were published with &quot; happiness &quot; in the last five years , and they gave about 40 , and there was a lot more .
there &apos;s a tremendous wave of interest in happiness among researchers .
there &apos;s a lot of happiness .
everyone would love to make people happier .
but despite all of this tide of work , there are multiple cognitive numbers that are kind of impossible to think about , to think about happiness .
and my talk today is mainly caused by these cognitive acts .
it &apos;s true for salmon , who think about their own happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists who think about happiness because it turns out that we are just as mess with everybody else .
the first of these drops is an immning , complexity .
it turns out that the word is just not a useful word anymore because we apply it to too many different things .
i think there &apos;s a certain meaning that we might be able to do , but in large and whole , this is something we need to give up , and we will take the complicated view of what well-being is .
the second trap is a change of experience and memory : essentially it &apos;s between happy in his life and happy his life , or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they are both together in the notion of happiness .
and the third is accountability illusion , and that &apos;s the unhappy fact that we can &apos;t think about a situation that affects well-being without its significance .
i mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
now , i &apos;d like to start with an example of someone who had a fractal book session after one of my lectures , who covered a story . &#91; unclear &#93; he said he heard a center , and it was absolutely beautiful music , and there was a terrible thing to the sound .
and then he added , really , really emotionally , that ruins the whole experience .
but it didn &apos;t .
what it had ruined was the memories of the experience .
he had the experience .
he had a 20-minute music .
they didn &apos;t count because he was concerned with a memory ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was everything he had to keep .
what that really tells us is that we might think about ourselves and other people in the sense of two types of self .
there &apos;s a living self that lives in the present , and the present knows is able to experience the past , but basically the present .
it &apos;s the living self that the doctor is doing -- you know , when the doctor asks , &quot; does it hurt if i put you here ? &quot;
and then there is a reminder of self , and the memory itself is that it &apos;s coming up and the story of our lives , and it &apos;s all the way that the doctor speaks by saying , &quot; how have you felt lately ? &quot;
or , &quot; how was your journey to albania ? &quot; or something like that .
these are two very different units , the living themselves , and the memory itself , and the two to confuse , is part of the kind of concept of happiness .
now , the memory itself is a storyteller .
and that really starts with a fundamental response to our memories -- it starts immediately .
we don &apos;t just tell stories when we &apos;re going to tell ourselves stories .
our memory tells us stories , which means what we can keep from our experience is a story .
and let &apos;s start with an example .
there &apos;s an old study .
these are actual patients who take a painful procedure .
i &apos;m not going to go to the details . it &apos;s not painful today , but it was painful when this study was done in the 1990s .
they were asked to cover all 60 seconds of their pain .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
and they &apos;re asked , &quot; who of both has more ? &quot;
and this is a very simple question .
patient b clearly suffered more . his gut was longer , and every minute of pain , the patient had a patient , and more .
but now there &apos;s another question : &quot; how much did these patients think they were suffering ? &quot;
and here &apos;s a surprise .
and the surprise is that patients had a much worse reminder to the gut reflection than the patient b.
the stories of the gut reflection were different , and because a very key part of the story is how it ends .
and no one of these stories is very common or great -- but one of them is that clear ...
but one of them is clear than the other .
and the ones that was worse was where the pain was at the end of its peak . it &apos;s a bad story .
how do we know that ?
because we asked these people to look at their gut , and also much later , &quot; how bad was the whole thing overall ? &quot;
and she was much worse for a than for b in memory .
well , this is a direct conflict between the living self and the memory itself .
in terms of the living self , b clearly had a worse time .
now , what you could do with the patient a , and we actually did clinical experiments , and it &apos;s been done , and it &apos;s actually working , you could actually cut the gut level of the patient a while you &apos;re just going to shake it up .
that will lead to the patient , but just a little bit less than before .
and if you do that for a couple of minutes , you make that the living self is a bad guy , and you have achieved that the memory itself is much better , because now you have a better story about his experience .
what does a story look like ?
and that &apos;s true of the stories that teach us and it &apos;s true for the stories that we invent .
and what a story is , it turns out , is , major eye appearance and end .
the end is very , very important and in this case dominated by the end .
well , the living itself lives continuously .
it &apos;s got eyeappearance of life , one after one .
and you ask : what happens to these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re forever lost .
i mean , most of the moments of our life -- and i &apos;ve done this -- you know , the psychological present is about three seconds long . what does you mean , you know , there &apos;s about 600 million of them in life , and there are about 600,000 . most of them don &apos;t leave behind .
most of you are completely ignored by the memory itself .
and yet , somehow you get the impression that you should count that what happens during those moments of life is our lives .
it &apos;s the limited resource we consume during the world .
and as we used to use it , it seems to be important , but that &apos;s not the story that keeps the memory itself for us .
so we have the memory self and the living self , and they &apos;re really quite different .
the biggest difference between them is the creation of time .
in terms of the living self , if you have a holiday and the second week is as good as the first one , then the two-week vacation is twice as good a week .
that &apos;s not how it works at all .
for the remembered itself , a weekly vacation isn &apos;t better than the one-week holiday , because there are no new memories .
they didn &apos;t change the story .
and in this way , time is actually the critical variable that is slightly different from a living self . time has very little influence on this story .
well , the memory itself makes more than remember and telling stories .
it &apos;s actually , in fact , that makes decisions , because if you have a patient who , say we had two gut reflections in two different surgeons and decides to decide which he should choose , then the one who &apos;s going to pick the memory , who is going to be selected , is the surgeon .
the living itself has no voice in this choice .
we don &apos;t actually choose between experiences . we choose between memories .
and even if we think about the future , we don &apos;t normally think of our future as experiences .
we think about our future as a prediction .
and basically , you can look at this , you know , as a funnei of remind myself , and you can think of yourself as one , which sort of makes the living itself through experience that doesn &apos;t need the living itself .
i have the impression that if we make vacation that is very often the case , that means we &apos;re doing a vacation on the subject of memory .
and that &apos;s a little hard to justify , i think .
i mean , how much are we from our memories ?
this is one of the explanations that is given for the dominance self .
and when i think about a holiday we &apos;ve done a few years ago in antarctica , which was clearly the best holiday i had ever had , and i think quite often in the relationship to how often i think about other vacation issues .
and i probably got from my memories to these three week trips , i would say about 25 minutes for the last four years .
well , if i had ever opened the folder with the 600 images in this , i had spent another hour .
well , these are three weeks , and they &apos;re just a one-hour hour .
there seems to be an inherent ability .
now , i like to be a little extreme , you know , how little appetitions i have on the knee of memories , but even if you do more of it , you have a real question , why do we give memories to the weight that we experience ?
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
imagine your next holiday , you know that at the end of the vacation , all of your images are wiped out , and you get an amnestic drug , so you will remember nothing .
now , would you choose the same vacation ?
and if you were to pick up a holiday , there &apos;s a conflict between two species of self and you have to think about how you decide that conflict and it &apos;s really not obvious at all , because if you think of it in the sense of memories , you can get a different answer .
why we pick up the vacation that we choose is a problem that turns out to be a choice between the two types of self .
well , the two types of self throw two terms of happiness .
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can use , one per self .
so you can ask : how happy is the living self ?
and then you would ask : how happy are the eyeappearance in life in life ?
and they &apos;re all -- happiness is a fairly complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
and , by the way , we &apos;re able to get a fairly good idea of happiness from the living self over time .
if you ask the teacher &apos;s happiness , it &apos;s a very different thing .
that &apos;s not how happy a person lives .
it &apos;s about how happy or silly the person is , if you think about your life .
very different term .
everyone who &apos;s not going to be different from the exploration of happiness , and i &apos;m trying to a lot of researchers on well-being that have the exploration of happiness in the very same way .
the distinction between happiness and happiness itself has been recognized in the last few years , and now you &apos;re trying to measure the two separate .
the gallup organization has a global survey where more than half a million people had asked questions about what they think about their lives and about their experiences , and there were other efforts in the direction .
so in the last few years , we started to learn about the happiness of the two types of self .
and the main lesson we think i &apos;ve learned is that they &apos;re really different .
you can know how someone is happy with his life , and that doesn &apos;t really teach you a lot about how happy he lives .
just to give you a sense of correlation , the correlation is about five .
what that means is that if you were to meet somebody and you would tell them , oh , his father is a two-meter man , how much would you know about his size ?
well , you would know something about its size , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
if i tell you that somebody has its life to be eight on a scale of 10 , they have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with his own selves .
so the correlation is very small .
we know something about the happiness of happiness itself .
we know that money is very important , targets are very important .
we know that happiness is mostly being satisfied with people we like to spend time with people we like .
there are other pleasure , but that &apos;s dominant .
so if you want to maximize the happiness of the self , you &apos;re going to do very different things at the end .
the implication of what i &apos;ve said here is that we really shouldn &apos;t imagine happiness as a loan for well-being .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
now , very quickly , another reason we can &apos;t think about happiness is that we don &apos;t pay attention to the same things when we think about life and when we actually live .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people are in california , they don &apos;t get the correct answer .
if you ask that question , you think that people in california have to be happier when they say , in ohio .
and what happens is that when you think about life in california , you think about the difference between california and other places , and that difference is , in climate .
well , it turns out that climate is not very important for being alive , and it &apos;s not even very important for the notion of thinking about how happy people are .
but now , because it &apos;s self-responsible , you can end up with a few people at the end of california .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to pursue what happens to people who are moving to the hope of becoming happier .
now , you &apos;re not going to get happier .
we know that .
but one thing is going to happen . you think they &apos;re happier because when they &apos;re going to think about it , they &apos;re reminded how awful the weather was in ohio , and they &apos;re going to feel that they made the right decision .
it &apos;s very hard to think about well-being , and i hope i &apos;ve got a sense of how hard it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question to you .
thank you .
now , as we had a couple of weeks ago , she mentioned to me that there was a pretty interesting outcome that came out of this .
is that something you can play with , because now you have a few minutes left ?
daniel kahneman : sure .
i think the most interesting result we found in the gallup survey is a number that we didn &apos;t expect to find .
we found this in terms of happiness itself .
if we looked at how emotions are related to income .
and it turns out that under the income of 60,000 dollars a year , for americans , and this is a very big sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a big sample of the group of 600,000 dollars a year .
60,000 .
dk : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars a year are unhappy , and they &apos;re getting unhappy , and they &apos;re getting more miserable .
we get an absolutely flat line .
i mean , i rarely saw so flat lines .
what happens is , obviously , money doesn &apos;t raise any experience happiness , but that lack of money is certainly misery , and we can measure this misery very , very clear .
in the sense of the other self , remember , you get another story .
the more money you deserve is you get happier .
that &apos;s not true of emotion .
but danny , in the entire american pursuit , is about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
if people take this spot seriously , i mean , it seems to me to put everything on your head , everything we believe in terms of tax policy and so on .
is there any chance that politicians , the country generally would take a fund like the serious and what would be based on politics ?
dk : you know , i think there are recognition for the role of survival in politics .
the recognition will be slow in the united states , not a question , but in the u.k. she &apos;s just going to happen , and in other countries it &apos;s happening right now .
people are to recognize that they should think of happiness when they think about politics .
it &apos;s going to take a while , and people will discuss whether they want to study experience happiness or whether they want to study life review , so we have to get this discussion pretty soon .
as you can get lucky , it &apos;s very different depending on how you think and whether you think about it or whether you think about it yourself .
that will affect politics , i think , in the coming years .
in the united states , you get to measure the experience happiness of the population .
this is , i think , in the next one or two decades of the national statistic .
now , it seems to me , this topic is going to be , or at least the most interesting political debate to pursue the next few years .
thank you for the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you , danny kahneman .
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal . i design video games .
i &apos;ve been developing for 10 years now , online games , and my goal for the next decade is to make it easy to save the world in reality , as you &apos;re in online play .
i have a plan for this . i want to convince more people , including all of them , spend more time with play more , more time .
we currently spend three billion hours a week on online play .
some of you might think , &quot; this is a lot of time for games . &quot;
perhaps something too much time when you consider how many problems we have in the real world .
but in fact , my research at the institute of the future for the future is exactly the opposite .
three billion hours a week are not nearly enough to solve the most pressing problems in the world .
in fact , i &apos;m convinced that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we have to increase this time dramatically .
i have calculated that it &apos;s time at 21 billion hours a week .
this may seem to be something that &apos;s going on , so i &apos;ll repeat it , so that if we solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflict and obesity , i think we need to try to play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week .
no , i mean really serious .
why ? this picture describes pretty much why i think games are so essential to survival of human species in the future . seriously .
this is a portrait of photographers toledano .
he wanted to capture the feelings of play . so , before the players , he built a camera .
this is one of the classic words in play .
if you &apos;re not a player , maybe you &apos;ll have some of the nuances in this picture .
you &apos;re probably looking at this sense of urgency , something fear , but also the very first concentration of responsibility in a really difficult problem .
if you &apos;re also playing , you see some noances here that are curved eyes and the mouth are a sign of optimism . the eyebrow show surprise .
this is a player who stands on the edge of something called an epic .
oh , you know that . ok . fine . so we have some players here .
a epic victory is a result that is so great that they didn &apos;t know that it was possible at all .
it was just beyond the imagination .
and if you do , you &apos;re shocked that you &apos;re actually able to be able to do this . this is an epic victory .
this player is a short victory .
and this is what we need to see in millions of faces of solving all over the world , if we &apos;re going to take the barriers to the next century in attack , the face of all odds on the edge of an epic bear .
well , unfortunately , we tend to see this face in real life when we face hard problems .
i call it the &quot; in life i am bad , &quot; and it &apos;s actually my face , you see ? yes ? ok .
that &apos;s me , as i &apos;m in life , i &apos;m doing bad face .
this is a graffiti in my former home in berkeley , california , where i studied in my ph.d. , why we are in games better than in real life .
that &apos;s a problem that many players have .
we think that in reality we &apos;re not as good as playing .
and i don &apos;t just mean less successful , even though that &apos;s what it is .
we do more in a game . i mean , in relation to the motivation , to do something significant , inspired by collaboration .
if we &apos;re in a game world , i believe that many of us are going to turn into our best version , anytime and immediately help help solve the problem , to try and solve the problem as long as necessary .
and in reality , if we fail to burn , we often feel different .
we feel overwhelmed . we deceived ourselves . we feel threatened , maybe depressed , frustrated or cynian .
these feelings we never have when we play games in games , they just don &apos;t .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to study as a graduate student .
why is it impossible in games to think , you could not just do anything ?
how can we translate these feelings into the reality ?
so i looked at games like world of warcraft , which gives the ideal environment to the collaborative problem .
and i &apos;ve found some things that make the epic wins in online worlds .
so , first of all , when you get in one of these online games , especially in world of warcraft , there &apos;s a lot of different characters that are willing to trust them , and that &apos;s right now .
but not just any mission , but a mission that fits perfect to your current level , right ?
so they do .
you never get a job that you can &apos;t solve .
but always on the edge of their capabilities , so they have to work . but there &apos;s no unemployment in the world of warcraft .
you &apos;re not sitting around , and you turn around . there &apos;s always something important to do .
and there are certain employees .
where they go , hundreds of thousands of people who work with them , to end their epic mission .
that &apos;s what we have in real life not so easy , that sense that in a fingerfit , people are willing to be ready .
there &apos;s also this epic story , these inspired history , why we are there and what we have to do .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
you &apos;ve heard about &quot; level up &quot; and &quot; + 2 power , &quot; or &quot; + one intelligence . &quot;
this constant feedback is not in real life .
if i leave this stage , i don &apos;t have one : + 1 and a crazy idea , + 20 crazy idea .
i don &apos;t get life in the real world .
so , the problem of cooperative online worlds like world of warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying to stand at the edge of an activist , that we &apos;re rather willing to spend our whole time in these game worlds .
they &apos;re just better than reality .
until today , all the world of warming players have spent 5.93 million years to solve the virtual problems of azeroth .
it &apos;s not necessarily something bad .
it may sound nasty .
but to see it in context , 5.93 million years ago , our first prigeancestors started walking upright .
so the first exciting primate .
ok , so when we talk about how much time we spend with play , it makes sense when you think about scale in terms of the scale of human development , which is extraordinarily .
but also , because it turns out that , by using this whole time to play , we actually change what we &apos;re doing as humans .
we develop to collaborative , much more creatures .
that &apos;s the truth . i believe that .
if you look at this interesting statistic that was published recently by a researcher of carnegie mellon university , the average young man of today in a country has 10,000 hours of play with a big deal of online life .
so , 10,000 hours is a very interesting number of reasons .
first of all , for kids in the united states , 10.080 hours are the real length that they spend in school , from fifth grade to graduate school -- if you never don &apos;t .
so we have a complete parallel of parallel , on the young people learning what it means to be a good player , like everything else you learn in school .
and maybe some of you have the new book of malcolm gladwell , &quot; overdrive , &quot; read .
so you know his theory of success , the theory of the success of 10,000 hours .
it &apos;s based on the great research of cognitive science , that if we spend 10,000 hours with the seed study of any thas to the 21st year , we &apos;ll be able to master .
we &apos;re going to be so good at what the most important people in the world are .
so , what we have here is a whole generation of young people who are masterpieces player .
so the big question is , &quot; what exactly is players masterpieces ? &quot;
because if we could figure that out , we would have never seen a human potential at all .
so many people now in the world are spending at least one hour a day with online games .
this is our master-player . 500 million people who are incredibly good in &quot; something . &quot;
and in the next decade , we have another billion players who are incredibly good at what they are .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
the game industry evolves , the energy , saving energy and work on mobile nets , instead of the broadband internet , so players can play all over the world , especially in india , china , brazil .
you have a extra billion players in the next decade .
so we have a total billion players .
so i started thinking about what it is to make these games .
here are the four things i found . first of all , reliable optimism .
ok , imagine how extreme self-motivated .
the optimism optimism is the desire to do something , to be able to master a barrier , with the belief that we have a set of hope on success .
players always believe that a epic victory is possible , and that it &apos;s always worth trying to do it .
players don &apos;t sit around .
players are masters of social networking .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting trials that are showing that we like people to do more after we &apos;ve played with them , even if they &apos;ve been fooled with us .
the reason for this is that it requires a lot of trust to play with someone .
we trust that somebody is talking to us , that the rules are being stopped , that we have the same goal , and to play the game .
so that &apos;s what they &apos;re allowed to do , and they &apos;re allowing them to grow commitment .
as a result , we build stronger social relationships .
happiness productivity . fantastic !
you know , there &apos;s a reason why the average word of warming players play 22 hours a week , as a result of time .
the reason is , when we play , we are actually happier to work hard , as if we can relax or nothing .
we know that as human beings are optimal , when we do hard , important work .
and players are always ready to work hard if they get the right job .
and finally , epical meaning .
players love to be part of awe of awe of planetary missions .
here &apos;s a background dinformation to put that in the right light . you know all wikipedia , the largest wiki in the world .
the second of the world &apos;s second wind , with almost 80,000 , is the world of warcraft .
five million people use it every month .
they &apos;ve collected more information about world of warcraft on the internet than any other kind of subject in the world .
they create an epic story .
they create an epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , so these are four superpowers that lead to one outcome . players are super-powerful , hopeful individuals .
it &apos;s people who believe that they can change as a single world .
and the only problem is they believe they can change the virtual worlds , but not the real .
that &apos;s the problem i &apos;m trying to solve .
edward casettova is a scientist .
his work is genius . he &apos;s looking at why people spend so much time , energy and money in online worlds .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re not going to witness from less than a mass of mass in virtual worlds and online play environments . &quot;
and that &apos;s from an economist . so it &apos;s logical .
and he says ...
not like me -- i develop games , i &apos;m a little overblown .
so he says that it actually makes sense , because players can reach more in online worlds than in real life .
they can make more powerful social binsions than in the real life . they get more feedback and reward in games than in real life .
so he says it &apos;s completely logical now that players spend more time in virtual world than in the real world .
i just agree , that &apos;s logical .
but it &apos;s definitely not an optical situation .
we need to start to turn the real world into a game .
my inspiration comes from an event that &apos;s 2,500 years back .
there are these ancient cube , from sheep &apos;s cube . you know ?
in front of these fantastic game controllers , there were sheep .
and these were kind of the first of people evolved playing devices .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the old greek historian of the old greek historian , you may know this story . the story about how and why games were invented .
according to herodotus , playing games , in the kingdom lydies , were invented during a famine .
there was such a big famine that the king of lydies decided to be a crazy idea .
people were fighting . people were fighting .
it was a very extreme situation . you needed to have an extreme solution .
so they invented , according to herodotus , and they created a national strategy , and one day you would eat . the next day you would play .
and they would be so much in the box of the box , because games are so fascinating , and with satisfying , happy productivity , that they would forget that there was nothing to eat .
and then the next day you would play . and the next day you would eat .
and according to herodotus , they survived this famine for 18 years by eating and playing the next day .
so , i think we &apos;re playing games today .
we &apos;re playing games to get rid of the real world .
we &apos;re playing games in order to disforce everything that doesn &apos;t work in the real world , which is not satisfying in real life , and we get what we need from games .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
that &apos;s the exciting thing .
according to herodotus , after 18 years , famine wasn &apos;t better . so the king decided to sit down a second .
they shared the kingdom in two half .
they were playing a box , and they were allowed to break up a epic adventure .
they left the lydies and they went to search for a new home . they just left so many people back to survive , and they were looking at the rest of a zone where they could survive .
that sounds crazy , right ?
but latest evidence of dna evidence that the etrus , the one who gives birth to the roman empire , the same dna as the old lyters have .
so scientists recently came to the perception that herodotus &apos;s mad history is actually true .
and geologists found evidence of global cooling , which was almost 20 years , which could explain famine .
so this crazy story could be voices .
maybe they actually saved their people through play by having 18 years in games for 18 years , and then they learned so much about each other , that they had saved the entire civilization .
so we can .
we &apos;ve been playing since 1994 .
this was the first strategy in real time in the world of warming series . that was 16 years ago .
they were playing the games for 18 years , and we &apos;ve been playing warcraft for 16 years .
i think we &apos;re ready for our own epic game .
so , they sent half of their civilization to search for a new world , so i &apos;ll take my 21 billion games a week .
we should overincome that half of us spend an hour with play , until we have solved the problems of the real world .
i know you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; how do we solve problems in the world ? &quot; and exactly that question , i dedicated my work to the institute in the last few years .
we have this banner in palo alto in our office in palo , which is how we should understand the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future before .
what we want is to create the future .
we want to think of the best outcome of the best , and then people get powerful to do this in reality .
we put together epic wins and giving people the opportunity to reach them .
i &apos;m going to show you three games that i &apos;ve designed to try and get to try and bring people to the epic in their own future .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
the game is by 2007 .
it &apos;s an online game where you have to overcome a oil force .
the oil force is invented , but we have enough online content so that it becomes realistic for you , and you actually live your real life without oil . so , if you get to the game , you &apos;re going to figure out where you &apos;re living , and then you &apos;re going to figure out how to do it .
we tested this game with 1,700 players in 2007 , and we accompanied it over the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was a transformative experience .
nobody wants to change their life because it &apos;s good for the environment or because we should .
but if you &apos;re in an epic adventure and you say , &quot; we &apos;re going to get oil . &quot;
this is an amazing adventure you &apos;re going to do .
find out how they would survive . most of our players have the habits in the game .
so for the next global world game , we have a bigger , higher target than just oil scarcity .
we &apos;ve developed the game &quot; superstruct &quot; at the institute for the future .
the point is , the computation of a supercomputer , the people on the planet have only 23 years left .
this supercomputer is called &quot; global judgment , sensitive system , &quot; of course .
the name of gamers , to sign up , is almost like a jerry-bruce film .
you know , jerry bruckheitan movies , where it &apos;s called the &quot; temam-team &quot; -- they have the astronauts , the scientists , the former , and they can save the world .
but in our game , instead of only five people , we say , everyone is in the auam-team , and it &apos;s our job , the future for energy , food , health , security and the future of social justice .
8,000 players played the game for eight weeks .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that they can read when they google , &quot; superstruct . &quot;
and the last game we get at the third of march , it &apos;s a game in collaboration with the world bank .
if you finish the game , you get the &quot; social retroage age , &quot; in 2010 .
we &apos;re working with universities in a very sub-saharan africa , and we &apos;re trying to learn a social change .
we have a comic book . we have &quot; level up &quot; for local understanding of knowledge , knowledge , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .
i want to invite you all to share this game with young people , all over the world , especially in development areas that benefit from their own social enterprise to save the world .
i come to the end .
i want to ask you something .
what do you think happens next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t rescued the real world yet .
well , i hope you agree with me that players are human resources that we can use to work in real life , and that games have a big meaning for change .
we have all these superpowers , happiness productivity , the ability to create tight social networks , credibility optimism and desire for epic meaning .
i really hope that we play a lot of games together to survive on this planet another century .
and i hope you &apos;ll play with me that way and play .
if i look at the next decade , i &apos;m sure about two things : that we can create any imaginable future , and we can play all kinds of games .
so i say , let &apos;s start the global change .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to tell you a little bit about what i was writing a couple of months ago when i was writing a piece of placebo .
i &apos;ve always been willing to write my synonyn dictionary , but i &apos;ve been able to work with the textile of the text , and i noticed that i &apos;ve never met in my life , what the word &quot; genius &quot; really means .
i read the post .
&quot; disabled , &quot; adjectively : &quot; verching , helpless , useless , destroyed , sweating , screwed , screwed , lacked , lastening , unpotent , uncontrollable , uncontrollable , uncontrollable , uncontrollable , uncontrollable , uncontrollable , uncontrollable , sherful , unfunctional , sherful , sherful , shered , shered , sherful , shered , shered ,
antonyme : healthy , powerful , powerful .
i &apos;ve read this list of a friend according to a friend , and i had to laugh , it seemed so ridiculous , but i was just going to be able to talk to them , and i didn &apos;t have to get to read and do that , first of all , to read and to do this .
of course , this was a devastating old synonyre dictionary . i just thought that the copy must be pretty old .
but in fact , it was a copy on the early &apos; 80s when i started with the elementary school , and i started to build my self-image outside of my family &apos;s territory , and to shape , in terms of other children and to the rest of the world around me .
and thank god i didn &apos;t use synonyale dictionary then .
if i would take this post seriously , i would be born in a world that someone like me would perceive as a person , whose life could be positive in any way , but today i &apos;m going to do the opportunities and adventure that i &apos;ve experienced .
so i immediately called the online copy of 2009 , and i expected to say that i &apos;m going to give you a one-year contribution .
here &apos;s the latest version of this proposition .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
and in particular , the last two words i &apos;m excited about is &quot; near antony &quot; and &quot; healthy . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just the words .
it &apos;s about what we think about people we describe with these words .
it &apos;s about the values that are put in these words , and how we construct these values .
our language affects our thinking and how we see the world and the people around us .
many ancient societies , including the greeks and the roman , have really believed that the language of a flight has a huge force , because what you &apos;re talking about is also true .
so , what do we actually want to manifest -- a disabled people or a powerful man ?
even a man &apos;s worth of saying to people as a child , could be rich , to turn them out and overload them .
wouldn &apos;t it be nice to open up doors ?
a man who opened up doors for me was my pediatrician at the a.i. institute in wilmington institute .
it &apos;s called dr. pizzutillo . an american , whose name , as you can think , most americans couldn &apos;t speak correctly . so he was always called dr. p. .
and dr. p. was always flying very colorful and was just designed to work with kids like this .
i found the time that i spent in this hospital just great -- to my physicist therapy .
i always had to repeat a lot of work with these heavy , elastic bchanges -- in different colors -- you know , to build my leg muscles , and i hated these bands more than anything else . i hated them . i hated them . i hated them .
and imagine , i even have a five-year child with dr. p. verist , and so i tried to stop this practice , naturally successful .
and one day he looked at me at one of my rehearses -- this practice was just tiring and admiration -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re such a powerful , powerful and young girl , you &apos;re going to tear one of those bands one day .
and if you do it , i give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
that was , of course , just a simple trick of dr. p. , so i do the training that i didn &apos;t want to do with the prospect that the richest five-year-old girls in the hospital are going to be in the second floor , but he actually brought me to see my daily practice horror .
and i ask myself today how much his vision of me as strong and powerful young girls shaped my self-image , and i could imagine myself as a nature of a strong , powerful and powerful man .
this is just an example of a lot of how adults can express the imagination of a child .
but as the quoting examples of the synonyn dictionaries said , our language doesn &apos;t show us a room to imagine what we all wish to do : to enable each other to see themselves as a powerful person .
our language is affecting the social changes that were caused by a technological change .
from the medical standpoint , of course , you can say that my legs , the laser surgery for visually disabilities , klow joints of titan and artificial bodies for aging , that allow people to use their own natural destiny , and they &apos;re not going to be able to help themselves .
so maybe this technological change may be clear because ever that there are always a different truth , which is that every human being is a very special and very powerful , and that the human ability to adapt to our biggest plus is .
the human ability to adapt to -- this is an interesting story , because people always ask me to talk about how i go around with widrities and i &apos;m going to give you a little bit of it : this phrase has never fit for me , and i think i &apos;ve always felt that i have felt why , and i think that &apos;s why i get there . &quot;
now , this phrase of dealing with widrities live from the idea that success or happiness depends on being a challenge , without being connected by this to be connected , because i would have been able to drop a life with a prosthetic arm , or how to perceive me with my disability .
but the truth is that we are changing . of course , we are from the challenge , whether you &apos;re physically physical , emotionally or even both .
and i say that &apos;s good .
widrities are not a barrier that we need to turn around to make our lives better .
amdrities are just to our lives .
and i get to see widrities as my shadow .
sometimes i think he &apos;s very present , sometimes he &apos;s hardly seen , but he &apos;s always at me .
and i don &apos;t want to have the impact or the severe , the hard fight of a person .
there are widrities in life , and challenges , and they &apos;re just at real times , and every person is doing it differently , but the question is not whether we seem to be clear or not .
so we &apos;re not just responsible for keeping people who we love to preserve , but they &apos;re also willing to get out of it .
and we don &apos;t really enjoy our children if we give them the feeling that they cannot adapt .
you have to separate two things : to be the medical fact , to be amputated and to the other social opinion of whether i &apos;m disabled or not .
and to be honest , the only real and empowering disability i had to share with , is that the world always says , you can describe me with these definitions .
in our desire to protect people who are at the heart of us , and they &apos;re telling them the cool , hard truth about their medical projection , or even a projection to the quality of life that they expect , we don &apos;t have to be disabled .
maybe the concept of the concept , which is just about what &apos;s going to be in a broken , and how we repair that , for every single one of the greater disability .
if we don &apos;t treat a human being , and don &apos;t perceive all his forces and possibilities and recognize , we &apos;ll be in addition to the natural fight that you may have to lead to , another disease .
we have a people who have value for our society .
so we have to look beyond patology and focus on all the human possibilities .
but the most important thing is that it &apos;s between perception of our senses and our great creative minds , a connection .
we shouldn &apos;t dismiss those challenging times , or denial , we should not try to avoid them , we should be able to avoid them under the carpet , but it &apos;s about recognizing the odds of survival .
it may be , perhaps , to make sure that we don &apos;t necessarily need to get rid of survival , but that we are open to embrace them , to put them on the sopf to use a fight , and maybe even dance with it .
and maybe we can do it as something natural , consistent and useful , and feel like that through their presence , not so badly .
in this year , we celebrate 200 . from charles darwin , and when he wrote about evolution , 150 years ago , darwin has written in my eyes , on something very real in the human character .
i would write it like this : not the most powerful of his kind , and not the intelligent of his kind , but the one who can adapt the best .
conflict emerges creativity .
not only from darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability of people to survive and to breed from the struggle of the human spirit is to transform through conflicts .
so , again , change and adaptation are the greatest skill of people .
and maybe we just know what we &apos;re using when we &apos;re really testing .
maybe that &apos;s the sense of widrities , a perception of the iphone , a sense of our own power .
we can give ourselves a little bit .
we can give away a new meaning that goes beyond severe times .
maybe we can see widrities as change .
amdrities stand for change that we haven &apos;t yet adapted to .
i think the biggest damage we &apos;ve added ourselves is to believe that we should be normal .
honestly -- who is normal ?
there &apos;s no normal .
there &apos;s the usual . the typical , but not the normal . and wouldn &apos;t you want to learn this poor , gray person , if it really existed ?
i think more not .
it would be great if we think of this paradigm of normality against another one of the possibilities or the strength to make it even a little bit more dangerous , communicating . so we can release the forces of very many children , and they invite them to bring their special and valuable skills into society .
michpolgen found that we have people from the members of our society , to be one of them : useful and to make a contribution .
there &apos;s evidence that the neanderthals have already carried older people and people with severe physical injuries , and that might happen because the life experience in the fight of these people is valuable .
they don &apos;t have these people as broken and less useless ; they were treated as something special and valuable .
a couple of years ago , i went to the city where i grew up in a food market in the red zone in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i was standing there in front of a straw totoes .
it was summer , and i had copper .
and i hear a guy behind me says , &quot; well , if that &apos;s not aimee mullins . &quot;
and i got around and i see these older men . i had no idea who he is .
and i said , &quot; excuse sir , we know ? i can &apos;t remember them . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , you &apos;ve barely remember me .
when i first saw her , i brought her out of her mother &apos;s belly . &quot;
oh , so the .
and then , of course , it &apos;s done .
this was dr. kean , a man i only knew from stories about my mother &apos;s day , because , of course , i was too late to my birthday two weeks .
the doctor for prwives diagnosed with my mother was on vacation , and so my parents knew the man who brought me to the world at all .
and because i was born without the legs , and my feet looked at them , and i just had a few toes on that one and a few toes on the other foot , he had to get the bad news .
he said to me , &quot; i had to tell your parents that you would never walk , and never be able to move like other children or that you &apos;ve never had an independent life ever since . &quot;
really , i found that he had collected newspaper cuts from my entire childhood , whether i had won a letter in the second grade in the second grade , whether i was going to take my scholarship on the drums of the parade , no matter whether i had my scholarship or a sport .
and he called this part of his crank factor , the potential of the human being .
you can &apos;t just emphasize enough how critical this factor can be for human quality .
and dr. kean kept on telling , he said , &quot; i &apos;ve learned that kids , if they &apos;re not told anything else , and even if they get a little support , they can get a lot of money on their own . &quot;
see , dr. kean has changed his thinking .
he understood that the health diagnosis , and how somebody involved with it , are two different things .
and also , i &apos;ve changed my way over time , if you asked me about 15 years old , if i would have asked my prosthesis for legs from flesh and bones , i wouldn &apos;t have missed a second .
i really wanted to work normal .
if you ask me that today , i &apos;m not sure .
and that &apos;s because i &apos;ve experienced something with my legs , and not despite that experience .
and maybe this change could happen because i &apos;ve seen so many people who opened up doors for me , rather than meet people who wanted me to be ashamed of me or an idea .
see , it really takes a person who shows you how you manifest your forces , and you &apos;re through .
if you allow somebody to activate your own inner forces , the human spirit is so tempted -- if you do that , and you open up a door for someone in a simple moment , you &apos;re a very good teacher .
they bring them to open up doors .
the real meaning of the lexicon is in the word &quot; carmen ce . &quot;
it means to produce something that is in one , the potential out of the potential .
again , what potential do we want to call off ?
in the &apos; 60s , in the u.k. , there was a case study in the u.k. that was transformed in total schools .
they call this &quot; enthrulating &quot; in the u.s.
the students are sent to grades .
and the a students are tested harder , getting better teachers , etc .
they have given over a three-month period of students with a &quot; good &quot; the grade &quot; very well . it was told you they were very clever , and after those three months , they really wrote .
and of course , it exploes to hear the heart that the converted students were told , they &apos;re only enough .
and that &apos;s what it was like after three months .
but only those who still were in school -- besides the students who had sent the school .
at the very heart of this study , the teachers were not covered .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
they were just told that if the students and the students are the students with the grade , and they &apos;ve taught them something and they &apos;re taught them .
the only real disability is a broken mind , a spirit that has broken , has no hope of hope . it doesn &apos;t find anything more beautiful . it lacks our natural childhood and our innate ability of imagination .
but if we can do it , to support the human spirit , to hope to hope themselves , and other people around it are beautiful to find , curious and conceptual , and then we have our forces really positive .
if you have a mind about these qualities , we can create a new reality and new form .
i want to end with a poem that was written by an persian poar named hafiz in 14th century , and my friend jacques zubois tells me , and the poem is called &quot; god , who knows only four words . &quot;
come on , dance with me . thank you .
how would you better be than you &apos;re currently ?
suppose i said that by a few changes , you could have a better memory -- precise , more specific and faster .
or you want to be urter , stronger , more force .
do you want more attractive and confident ?
how would it be to live longer with good health ?
or maybe they &apos;re one of those who always spread for more creativity .
what would you love most ?
what would you like to have if you could only have one ?
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see .
a few . probably about as many as creative people here .
that &apos;s very good .
how many would be deciding for a good memory ?
a few more .
how about fitness ?
a few less .
what about longevity ?
ah , the majority . the lsees i like to see as a doctor .
if you could have one of them , it would be a very different world .
is it all just education ?
or maybe it &apos;s possible ?
evolution is an ongoing theme here on the ted conference , but today i want to give you the view of a doctor &apos;s point .
the big geneticists in the 20th century , t. g. dobzhansky , who was also a communist in the russian orthodox church , wrote an essay with the title &quot; nothing in biology . &quot;
now , if you &apos;re one of those who don &apos;t accept the proof of biological evolution , this would be a very good time to switch out your listening , you take your personal devices -- i &apos;ll give you the permission and maybe you can look at this .
but if you accept biological evolution , do you think it &apos;s about the past , or is it about the future ?
is it for others , or does it matter ?
this is another view on the tree of life .
in this picture , i &apos;ve put a bush as a center of the initiation in all directions , because if you look at the edges of the tree of life , all the existing species of the tree have been successful in evolutionary terms : they have survived ; it &apos;s been protecting its environment , and demonstrated its strength .
the human part of this book , far at the end , is , of course , what we &apos;re most interested in .
we two-legged from a common ancestor to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago .
in this period , there might be 20 or 25 different varieties of hominids .
some are coming and left .
we &apos;ve been here for about 130,000 years .
it seems like we &apos;re right from parts of the other parts of life , but actually the biggest part , the fundamental mechanisms of our cells are quite the same .
is it clear that we can pull out and use the mechanisms of a shared bacterium to produce the protein of the human insulin , which is used to treat diabetic ?
this is not like human insulin ; this is the same protein that is chemically undiverse from what comes out of the panse .
and as we talk about bacteria , you realize that every one of us in our gut has more bacteria than it leads to the rest of our bodies ?
maybe 10 times .
i mean , do you think if antonio damasio asks your self-image , you think about the bacteria ?
our gut is a wonderful hospitous environment for these bacteria .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s wet , it &apos;s very emotional .
and you &apos;re all going to give them all the nutrients that they just want to offer without effort .
it &apos;s really a mild way of bacteria , with occasional subditions of unintended , jeodch forced for the outcome .
but otherwise , they &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria , just as they care about their lives .
they help in the spirit of essential nutrients , and they protect them against certain diseases .
but what will happen in the future ?
are we in a kind of evolutionary equilibrium in a form of species ?
or are we determined to become something else -- something that might even be better about the environment ?
now let &apos;s take a step back into the era of the big bang 14 trillion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years ago -- the first signs of creatures , maybe three to four billion years ago -- and then the human species , which is after last in the last 130,000 years .
in this vast inperfect symphony of the universe , life is just a short measure of life on earth ; the animal kingdom , as an individual , and of human life , a small proversion .
we were .
this is also worth the entertainment of this speech , so i hope , d ace .
now , when i was a college on college , i had my first biology classes .
i was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology .
i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i realized something very fundamental : in most of the existence of life in individual organisms , each cell is divided , and all the genetic information of the cell will continue to continue in both cell cells .
but at the time , as a mulular organisms , things began to change .
sexual reproduction comes into the picture .
and very important : with the introduction of sexual reproduction , the genome is going to be the rest of the body .
in fact , you could say that the inevitable part of the death of our body in evolution is at the same moment as the sexual reproduction .
now i have to say , if i was a college student , i thought , okay , sex / death , sex / death , death for sex -- it seemed to be pretty reasonable at the time , but with every year , it has been to my thinking .
i came to understand the emotions of george burns who was in las vegas in the &apos; 90s .
and one night , there &apos;s a pat on his hotel door .
he opens the door .
in front of him , there &apos;s a beautiful handdress professor .
she looks at him and she says , &quot; i &apos;m here for supersex . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s wonderful , &quot; george says , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the soup . &quot;
i came to discover as a doctor that i was working on a goal that was different than the goal of evolution -- not inevitable , just different .
i tried to keep the body .
i wanted to keep ourselves healthy .
i wanted to recreate health after a disease .
i wanted to have a long and healthy life .
evolution is all about the survival of the genome to the next generation , adaptation and survival generation .
from an evolutionary standpoint , they are and i like booster rockets to send the genetic request to the next level of orbit , then to drop into the ocean .
i think we would all get the mood , the woody of all the expression , when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to get into my work .
i want to do it by not dying . &quot;
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily mean to prefer the longest life .
it doesn &apos;t necessarily include the biggest , the most powerful or the fastest , and not even the smartest .
evolution prives the creatures who adapt best to their environment .
it &apos;s the test of survival and success .
on the bottom of the ocean , there are bacteria that are thermophil , and therefore , the raw state survival , otherwise , if fish were there , they would have a vacuum of fish to do it .
so , what does that mean when we look back at what &apos;s happening in evolution , and how we think about the space of people in evolution , and especially like we &apos;re looking at the next phase , i would say that there &apos;s a series of options .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to move forward .
we &apos;ve achieved a kind of balance .
and the reasons for this would be , first of all , we managed to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been selected and removed from the population .
and secondly , as a species of species , we have our environment so configusive that we &apos;ve managed to adapt to ourselves , and we adapt to them .
and by the way , we hike and circle and mix so much that they can &apos;t say that isolation is necessary for evolution to find progress .
a second possibility is that it will be evolution of traditional species , of course , of nature &apos;s forces .
and the argument here would be that the wheels of evolution are slowly masted , but they are inadequate .
and so far the isolation is when we live as a species of planet , and there will be an overlap and changes of the environment that could produce evolution in a natural way .
but there &apos;s a third possibility , a fake , fascinating and terrifying possibility .
i call it neo-evolution -- the new development that doesn &apos;t just , of course , but led to us as an individual , in decisions we make .
now , how could that happen ?
how could it be that we do this ?
let &apos;s first look at the reality that people today are making decisions about their offspring .
they are , in some cultures that have choice to have more men than women .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and family choose .
so think of it if it wasn &apos;t just possible to choose the gender of your child , but also to make genetic adaptations that will cure disease and prevent it .
what if you could make the genetic changes to remove diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s or reduce the cancer risk of cancer or stroke ?
wouldn &apos;t you want to do it in your genes ?
if we predict , this kind of changes will be increasingly possible .
human genome project began in 1990 , and it took 13 years .
it cost 2.7 billion dollars .
next year , when it was done in 2004 , they could do the same thing for 20 million dollars in dra to four months .
today , you can take a sequence of three billion base pairs of the human genome to a price of about $ 20,000 and in the space of about a week .
it &apos;s not going to take long , until the reality will be that there will be 1,000 dollars of human genomes , and it &apos;s going to be available to everybody .
a week ago , the national academy of engineering is the draper prize for francis arnold and wilwell stemmer , two scientists who have developed independent techniques to do the natural process of evolution , to work faster and to have more efficient proteins in a more efficient way -- which frances arnold .
a couple of years ago , the laser award was served by scientist shinya yamanaka for his research in which he took an adult care , a powing , and through manipulation of only four genes , the cell developed to become a pluripotent stem cell .
these changes are coming .
the same technology that can make the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not just protection of themselves , but also to serve against other viruses .
whether you believe it or not , it &apos;s an experimental study in the gang with the vaccine against influenza in the cells of a spreakplant .
can you imagine something good that comes out of tobacco ?
this is all reality today , and the future is going to be much more possible .
imagine just two other small changes .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells of your entry ?
what if you could change the sperm and protein cells or the fresh egg , to give your children a better chance for a healthier life -- reduces the diabetes of the cancers of cancer ?
who doesn &apos;t want to be healthier ?
and then the analytic technology , the same engine of science that can enable changes to prevent disease , could also allow us to prevent , potentially , hyper-capacity -- the better memory .
why don &apos;t you have the skill of a ken jennings , especially if you can extend it to the next generation of the watt-machine ?
why not have the fast muscle fibers that will allow you to run faster and longer ?
why not live anymore ?
these are being untapped .
and if we &apos;re in a place where we can pass it to the next generation , and we can adopt the attributes that we want , we will be transformed by alt-style evolution to neo-evolution .
we &apos;re going to have a process that actually requires 100,000 years , and we can do it for a thousand years -- and maybe even the next 100 years .
these are decisions with which their grandchildren have to be , or their grandchildren , to become involved .
we use these decisions to form a society that is better , who is more successful ?
or will we choose different attributes that we want for some of us and not for others ?
are we going to be a society form of society and uniformative , or more robust and more robust ?
these are the kinds of questions we have to be facing .
and most of all , are we ever going to be able to develop the wisdom , and the wisdom we need to do to make these decisions ?
in the good , in the bad , and before you might think , these decisions are going to be us .
thank you .
i want you to imagine something that gives you a portable robot that gives you human ability , or another one that helps you stand up and go up and go .
in berkeley , we call these robots exotic skeletons .
they &apos;re not anything that they &apos;re putting in the morning and gives them extra strength and will increase their pace , and that will help them keep their balance for example .
this is actually the true effect of human and machine .
but not just that -- and connect and connect with the universe and other devices out there .
it &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
now to show you what we &apos;re working on , we start talking about the american soldiers , the average about 100 pounds on its back , and it &apos;s the question that they should carry more equipment .
of course , this leads to some major complications -- spinal injuries , 30 percent of it -- chronic spinal injuries .
so we thought we would embrace this challenge and create an exotic skeleton that would help deal with this problem .
so let me introduce to you now -- or the human universal therapist .
soldier : with the hulc exotic skeleton , i can carry 200 pounds of different terrain , many hours long .
its flexible design allows it to be very low , to sky and carry very much movements .
it feels what i want to do , where i want to go and increase my strength .
we &apos;re now with our industrial partner of this device , this new exotic skeleton in this year .
so it &apos;s true .
now , let &apos;s look at our perspective on the wheeldays , something that i &apos;m particularly passionate about .
there are 68 million people estimated in the wheelchair in the wheelchair .
this is about one percent of the population .
and that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate .
we &apos;re often talking about very young people with spinal cord injuries that are in their lifetime in their lifetime -- 2020s , 30s , 440s -- from the destiny , and the wheelchair is the only option .
but it &apos;s also about aging population , whose number is multiplied .
and so pretty much the only option -- if it &apos;s about a brain beat , or other complications -- the wheelchair .
and so , by the way , for 500 years , since i &apos;ve been saying , i have to say very successful introduction .
so we thought we could start writing a completely new chapter in mobility .
now let me introduce you door , which is carried by amanda boxtel , who had a spinal cord injury in 19 years ago , who had a spinal cord injury , that she couldn &apos;t walk anymore for 19 years and so far .
thank you .
as i said , amanda carries our frugs .
it has sensors .
his fully non-invasive sensors in the tches , sending back the signals back to the computer computer , which is here on their back .
here are battery packets , the motor drive is on their mouth , as well as on their knees , which they move forward in this pretty smooth and very natural orbit .
i was 24 years old , and as a monstrous pure tree , as a ski tree , i was paralyzed .
in a fraction of a second , i lost every feeling and every movement in my closing .
not long after that , a doctor in my hospital and he said , &quot; amanda , you &apos;ll never go again . &quot;
and that was 19 years ago .
he &apos;s steel every five of my consciousness .
adaptable technologies since i can get to learn to ski again , climb and even drive the hands .
but nothing was invented that would let me go again , until now .
thank you .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to meet us and discuss them .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we have all the potential here to change life from future generations -- not just for soldiers , or for amanda here and all the wheelpers , but for all .
thank you .
at home in new york , i &apos;m a leader of a non-profit organization called robin hood .
if i don &apos;t have fought the poverty , i fought as a fireman of a fireman in a volunteer train .
now , in our city , where volunteers have contributed a highly skilled workforce , you have to be pretty early at the branding .
i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunteer at the branding , so i had a pretty good opportunity to go in .
but it was still a man to reach against the other volunteers and find out what &apos;s going to be our work .
when i found the main man , he was in a very serious conversation with the janitors who certainly had one of their worst days .
it was in the middle of the night , and she was in the sleeping train , and barm under a screen in the fixed rain , while her house was in flames .
the other volunteer that arrived in front of me was -- let &apos;s call him lex luther -- the main man was first and asked to go to the house and save the dog &apos;s dog .
the dog ! i was talking to you .
there was some lawyer or a profit race that could now tell for the rest of his life , that he went to a burning of a house to save a living creature , just because he was five seconds faster than i was .
well , i was the next one .
the main man to join me .
he said , &quot; comms , you have to go to the house .
you have to go up , the fire over , and you have to get some shoes . &quot;
i swear .
well , not exactly what i was hoping to do , but i went -- the trebs up , the fluter along , the real &quot; firemen , &quot; on the &quot; the real &quot; of firemen , was just quite finished in the bedroom to get some shoes .
i know what you &apos;re thinking , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i was going down my prey down where i met my doordoorpress and the beloved dog .
we put our valuations out to the house , where , not surprisingly , to get more attention than mine .
a few weeks later , the firetellers got a letter of the janitors , in which they refused to take care of their house .
one of the things that really measured kindness : somebody actually brought a pair of shoes .
both in my profession in robin hood and in my side profession as a volunteer fireman , i &apos;m a witness of generosity and kindness in great scale , but i also also see the charity and the individual of the individuals .
and you know what i &apos;ve learned ?
they &apos;re all important .
so if i look around in this room and see people who have either been successful , or in their way there , i want to offer that question : don &apos;t wait .
don &apos;t wait for making a difference in another life , until you &apos;ve reached your first million .
if you have something to give , you give it .
use them in a soup kitchen , they live a park in the neighborhood .
be a mentor .
not every day will give us a chance to save the life of a human , but every day gives us the opportunity to change one .
so , put it on ; save the shoes .
thank you .
bruno guissani : mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
i just come back from a community that knows the secret of humanity &apos;s existence .
it &apos;s a place where women lead the zepter , with sex &apos; says , &quot; and the game is the day -- where a serious deal is .
and no , it &apos;s not hype or san francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , their relatives .
this is the world &apos;s wild bonobos in the ancient forest of congo .
bonobos are together with chimpanzees with our next living relative .
that means we have a common ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother , about six million years ago .
well , chimpanzees are known for their aggressive .
but unfortunately , we &apos;ve overstated this aspect in the narrative of human evolution .
but bonobos show us the other side of the medal .
as a chimpanzee of large , fear of anxiety , the approval of empowerment made a female of empowerment .
the ones that really came up with this , because that leads to a profoundly tolerance society in the fatal force .
but unfortunately , bonobos are least known among the primates .
they live in the deep of the crgolesur whale , and they &apos;re just hard to be available .
congo is a paradox -- a country of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but the heart of darkness itself -- the scene of a violent argument that has been in love for decades and so many of the lives have been paying for the first world war .
it doesn &apos;t surprise that these destruction also have the survival of the bonobos .
meat trade and the decline of the tree is that you can &apos;t even fill a stadium with the slaved bonobos -- and even we &apos;re not sure to be honest .
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a hidden laugh that the trees are bouncing .
who are these relatives ?
we know them as &quot; love instead of war &quot; monkeys , because they have common genes , also exexsive sex , with interchanges partners , and rules like that .
i &apos;m not saying that &apos;s the answer to all humanitarian problems -- because life is made up of more than the chama sutra .
bonobos -- like humans -- love to play their lives .
play doesn &apos;t mean only child games .
for us , it &apos;s fundamental for the attachment of relationships and the care of tolerance .
we learn trust and the rules of the game .
play creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s all about diversity of diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity of behaviors , diversity of behaviors .
and if you look at bonobos in play , you see the evolutionary origins human supply , dance and ritual .
play is the tickt that keeps us .
well , i don &apos;t know how they play , but i want to show you some unique footage from the wild .
first of all , a ballgame on port-au-prince -- and i don &apos;t think about dirt .
so here we see a young female and males in a chase game .
look at what she &apos;s doing .
this could be the evolutionary source : &quot; you put it in the eggs . &quot;
just that i think it &apos;s more like him , right ?
yeah !
so sex games are prevalent , both bonobos and people .
and this video is really interesting , because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows the ideality , with which you bring new elements to play -- like the tewerers -- and also , while the game is demanding , it &apos;s fun .
but the game is a formal force .
play is a malumler , and it can take a lot of shapes , some of which are a little quiet , conceptual , curious -- maybe to discover the amazing one again .
and i want to show you , this is fuku , a young female , and she plays peace with water .
i think just like you &apos;re playing , sometimes , and we &apos;re looking at the limits of our inner and external worlds .
and it &apos;s this playful curiosity that allows us to explore , and interact . and the unexpected effects that we form are the real resource of creativity .
this is just a little pretaste on the insights that bonobos give us our past and present .
but they also have a secret for our future , a future where we need to adapt to rising challenges , by larger creativity and labch cooperation .
the secret is that the game of the key is to these skills .
in other words , play is our adaptive yoker .
in order to succeed for us , we have to play .
but will we make the best of our play drive ?
play is not silly .
it &apos;s essential .
for bonobos and humans , life consists of teeth and claws alone .
just when it seems to be hardly appropriate , perhaps the most essential .
and so , my pripleclassmates , let &apos;s embrace this gift of evolution , and play in games while we &apos;re discovering creativity and wonder .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two pairs , in 1979 , in 1979 at exactly the same time , in exactly the same moment , a baby -- ok .
so two pairs , each element is a baby .
now i don &apos;t want you to spend too much time to imagine creation because , if you &apos;re going to imagine the whole time , you won &apos;t listen to me .
just imagine that for a moment .
and in this scenario , you can imagine that in a case , the sema carries a y chomomar , which hits the x chromosome of the egg .
and in the other case , it carries a x chromosome to the x chromosome of the egg .
both of them are survival , both light .
we &apos;re still coming back to these people .
in most of my activities , i have two kliers .
under a hat , i &apos;m looking at the anatomy of the anatomy .
i studied an historian , and in this case , i study how people went with anatomy -- that human body , animal body -- how they went around with body fluids , as they were thinking about bodies .
the other hat that i &apos;ve carried in my work is that the activist , as a patient lawyer -- or , i sometimes say , as an impatient lawyer -- of people who are patients from doctors .
in this case , i worked with people who have the body , the social norms in question .
so for example , i worked with people who are siamese twins , two people in a body .
i worked with people with zwarf growing -- so people who were smaller than common .
and very often , i worked with intersexual people whose gender is essential -- so people who don &apos;t have the average male or female bodies .
and as a general term , we can use the word of intersexual ality .
intersexuality comes into many different forms .
i just give you a couple of examples of the type of gender variation that are not the male or female standard .
in a case , you may have someone with a metronchromosome base , and the thry gene of the y chomosoms leaves the cursor that we &apos;re all investing in .
and that &apos;s why the tewerers in fetsal give testosterone .
but because this individual is missing the receptors to recognize testosterone , the body doesn &apos;t respond to testosterone .
and this is called androgentaan defect .
so much testosterone , but no response to that .
as a consequence , the body evolves more to the typical female course .
if the kid is born , she looks like a girl .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s being raised as a girl .
but it usually takes until you get puberty and grow your breasts and grow , but you &apos;re not going to get your period , until somebody comes to it , and it &apos;s something different here .
and they do a couple of tests , and they find that instead of squeersticks , and in fact , they &apos;re actually teaming off , and that they have a y chromosome .
it &apos;s important to understand that you could actually hold this person for a male , but it &apos;s not really .
women , like men , have in our bodies something called adrenalinet .
they &apos;re in the back of our body .
and the side kidneys represent androgenes which are virilisizing hormones .
most women , like me -- i think to be a typical woman -- i don &apos;t know my real chromosome , but i think i &apos;m probably going to have the typical -- most women like me actually talk to android .
we produce androges and we &apos;re talking to androgenic .
the consequence is that somebody like me actually has a brain that was exposed to more androgenic than a woman born , and a androuri defector has been born .
so gender is really complicated ; intersexual are not just in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in some sense , you can be spread over the range of bandwidth .
one more example : a couple of years ago , i received the call of a 19 year-old man who was born as a young boy , who had a girlfriend , had sex with his girlfriend , lived with his husband , and he had just found out that he had eivaristicks and a utera .
he had an extreme form of bykidney cattle hyperdenes .
he has xx chromosome , and in utero , his side kidneys were so active that they basically created a male hormone environment .
and as a consequence of that , his genesism came out of male male , his brain was exposed to the opium male part of the hormone spectrum .
and when he was born , he looked like a boy -- no one was aunded .
and only when he was 19 years old , he got enough medical problems , actually , because he was in the inside that the doctors found that he was in the inner female .
okay , just a quick example of an intersexual ingredient .
some people with xx chromosomes develop something that is called the ozone estis , which is the oaf tissue of hodentissue tissue .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this happens .
so gender can occur in many different varieties .
the reason why kids with this kind of body -- it grew up , or siamesese twins , it &apos;s interesting -- of surgeons often adapted to the norm , is not because this is for their physical health benefits .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
the reason why they &apos;re often done in many different ways is because they &apos;re unlocked our social categories .
typically our system is based on the idea that one particular anatomity is associated with one particular identity .
so we have the concept that being a woman is called a female identity ; a black person is supposed to have an african anatomy in terms of the own story .
so we have this horrible idea .
and if we &apos;re faced with a body that actually represents something very different for us , it &apos;s very confused to these arguments .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas about individualism .
and our nation is really based on a very romantic concept of individualism .
now you can imagine how amazing it is when children are born , who are two people in a body .
now , the last time i had experienced most of the time , the south african is caster semenya last year , whose gender was asked in the leichatchal world championship in berlin .
a lot of journalists call me the question : &quot; what test are you going to do to see if caster semenya female or male ? &quot;
and i had to explain the journalist that there &apos;s this test .
we now know that gender is complicated enough that we need to admit that nature doesn &apos;t have line between a male and female , or sexually and sexually and sexually and sexually , touch is us , of course .
so we have a situation where , the further our science advances , we have to stand around so much that these categories that we had given for stable anatomic categories , which made very simple access to create permanent identity , much less than we imagined .
and that &apos;s not just about gender .
it &apos;s also true of race , which turns out to be a much more complicated than our terminology .
in our view , we found in all sorts of incurms .
for example , we run on the fact that we have at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees .
what are we going to do with the fact that we &apos;re only different from just a few nuclear diving ?
while we continue to push our science further , we &apos;re increasingly coming into a zone of uncomfortable where we need to recognize that the simplistic categories we &apos;ve had probably too simplistic .
we see that in all sorts of different terms of human life .
one of the areas that we see in the beitl , in our culture today , in the united states today , are the fighting over the beginning and the end of life .
we have a difficult conversation about what a body becomes for people , so it has another right than the fetal life .
we have a very difficult disconnect today -- perhaps not as public as in medicine -- the question of when someone is dead .
our ancestors never used to fight that hard to fight when someone was dead .
you &apos;ve got one of the people that &apos;s right under the nose , and if you moved , you haven &apos;t buried them yet .
if you don &apos;t move , you &apos;ve buried it .
but today we are in a situation where we take people living vital organs and they want to grow other people .
and as a result , we start with the struggle with the really difficult question when someone is dead , and that brings us into a really difficult position that we don &apos;t have as simple categories as we used to .
now , you might think that the whole thing collapses from categories is someone like me really happy .
i &apos;m progressive , i &apos;m defending people with unusual bodies , but i have to admit , it makes me nervous .
to understand that these categories are really much more insecure than we thought , i was depromised .
and it makes me tick in terms of thinking about the democracy of democracy .
so to tell you about this tension , i first have to know that i &apos;m a big fan of the founding fathers .
i know they were ragged , i know they were afraid , but they were great .
i find that they were so brave and strong , and so radically , in what they were doing , i &apos;m going to look at all some of the years that i &apos;m going to do in 1776 , and it &apos;s not because of the music that &apos;s absolutely forgotten .
it &apos;s because of what happened in 1776 with the greeners .
the green fathers were from my view of the original anatomic activists , which is why .
what she woke back was an anatomic concept , and they took it through another , which was radical and beautiful , and 200 years for us .
as you all remember , our founding fathers were the concept of monarchy , and the monarchy integrated in a very simplified concept of anatomy .
the mainframe of the old world had no concept based on dna , but they had a concept of birth on the right .
they had a concept of blue blood .
they were the notion that people who had political power should have this political power , because of the blood bloodline from the grandfather to the son and so on .
the green fathers revealed this idea , and they put them through a new anatomic concept , and this concept said that all people were creating equal .
it was nivelled to the field , and decided that anatomically , the common common , the common ones , and that was very radical .
now they did that because they were part of an educational system where two things grew together .
democracy grew up , but at the same time , the science grew up .
if you look at the history of the founding fathers , that many of you were very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of natural commons .
they went away from explanations , and meadows things like a natural idea of power , back , where the transmission on a very vacro concept of birth is based .
they moved to a natural idea .
and if you look at the state of independence , you talk about nature and the god of nature .
they don &apos;t talk about god and nature .
they talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
and as part of this , they gave us a concept of anatomical similarities .
and they really prepared the future of civil rights movement .
they didn &apos;t think that way , but what they did for us was great .
so what happened after that ?
for example , women who &apos;ve been using the right response to the election , the concept of the founding fathers , who says that anatomical wealth is more important than the anatomical difference , and said , &quot; that we have a utera , and we &apos;re not meaningful enough that we should not have the election right , the right thing to be honest , etc . &quot;
and women argued successful .
next , the most successful civil rights movement , where we saw people like somtner , who would get on that , &quot; am i not a woman ? &quot;
we find men in the linerows of the burden of justice , saying , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , people different from the color that are in anatomical terms of anatomical differences , again , successful .
we see the same at the disabled legal movement .
and of course , the problem is , as well as we start to look at all the similarities , we have to start asking in question why we are limited to certain species .
well , well-realizing , i want to maintain certain species , anatomically , in our culture .
for example , i don &apos;t want to give a fish the same rights as a person .
i don &apos;t want to say that we should take away from the anatomy .
i don &apos;t want to say that 5-year-old should have the right to get your understanding of sex or get married .
so there are some anatomical strands that make sense to me , and that &apos;s what i think should be .
but the challenge is to try to figure out what it is and why we keep them , and whether they &apos;re meaningful .
so let &apos;s come back to these two creatures that have been identified at the beginning of the speech .
we &apos;ve discovered two creatures , both in 1979 in the middle of 1979 .
imagine that one of them was born , maria , three months , so she was born on june one of june , 1980 .
heinrich , on the other hand , is born to the midstand , so he &apos;s born on march one of 1980 .
only because of the fact that maria 3 months were born , they will get all kinds of rights three months before heinrich -- to have the right sex to choose the right to drink .
heinrich needs to wait for all this , not because he actually has another biological age , just because of the time of his birth .
we find other strange influences on what their rights are .
heinrich , because you think he &apos;s a male -- even though i haven &apos;t told you that he &apos;s the mit -- because you think he &apos;s a male , he &apos;s now going to be able to do what maria doesn &apos;t have to worry about .
maria , unlike all states , can &apos;t perceive the same right , the heinrich in all states , and that &apos;s right to marry .
heinrich can marry a woman , but maria can only marry a woman today .
so we have these permanent anatomal categories that are in many ways that are problematic and fragmented .
and for me , the question is : what are we going to do , because our science is doing such progress in the anatomy of anatomy that we have to make a point where we have to admit that democracy is based on anatomy ?
i don &apos;t want to give up science , but at the same time , sometimes it feels like science makes self-awareness .
so where do we go ?
it seems like our culture will take a kind of pragmatic posture : &quot; well , we need to pull a line , so we &apos;ll pull them somewhere . &quot;
but a lot of people start in a very strange position .
so , for example , texas at a point decided that it &apos;s a man to marry that you don &apos;t have a y chromosome , and a woman to marry that you have a y chromosome .
now in practice , people are not tested to their chromosomes .
but it &apos;s also very bizarre because of the story i told you about the androrecipe defector .
if we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us in his &quot; i have a dream , &quot; a kind of solution .
he says we should not believe in people , but after the property of their character , &quot; judge , &quot; and it goes beyond anatomy .
and i want to say , &quot; yeah , it sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
but how do you do that in practice ?
how do you evaluate people because of their character properties ?
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we should distribute rights in terms of people , because i have to admit that i have to know a number of golden styles that probably make a sociality more than some people i know .
i want to tell you that i probably know some bright labdodordogs who are more concrete , more intelligent and more mature decisions about their sexual relationships than some 40 years i know .
so how do we address the question of the character of the character ?
it turns out to be really difficult .
and part of me asks , what if the content of a character would be something that would be readable in the future -- could be made by mri ?
do we really want to go to that direction ?
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
what i know is that it seems really important to think about the idea that the united states is leading to worry about questions of democracy .
in our effort , we have done our thing properly well , and i think we would make our thing good in the future .
we don &apos;t have the situation , for example , in the case of iran , where a man is drawn to other men who are drawn to other men &apos;s death , because it &apos;s ready to undertake one of those tumors in which he can stay alive .
states of this kind exist in us .
i &apos;m glad to say that we don &apos;t have these states -- a surgeon that i spoke to a few years ago , which had a few siamesese twins to separate them , in part to make a name .
but when i was dancing with him , and asked him why he made this intervention -- it was high risk surgeries -- his answer that in his country , these kids would be very bad , and so he had to do it .
i told him , &quot; well , do you have a political asylylum , instead of a surgery to separate it ? &quot;
the united states has an incredible opportunity to allow people to be the ones that they are without the state of the government .
so i think we need to be leaders .
well , just to conclude , i want to realize that i &apos;ve talked very much about the fathers .
and i want to think about the possibility of how democracy could look , or looked at if we had the mothers involved more .
and i want to say something that is a feminist something that is a feminist thing , and i think that there might be different ways of insight that are based on different kinds of anatomy , especially when people use a group thinking .
since years , since i &apos;ve been interested in intersexuality , i &apos;ve also been interested in studying gender in the region of gender .
and one of the things i really found interesting is the difference between men and women in terms of how they think and operate in the world .
what we &apos;ve experienced from cultural studies is that women , average -- not every one , but on average -- tend to tend complex social relationships and the people who are vulnerable in the group of vulnerable , very much attention .
and that &apos;s why when we think about it , we have an interesting situation .
years ago , when i went to graduate school , one of my graduate students asked me , who knew my interest in feminism -- i looked at myself as a feminist , so it &apos;s a really strange question .
he said , &quot; tell me what the newtonism is female . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s the stupidest question i &apos;ve ever heard .
in feminism , it &apos;s about treating gender about gender , so feminism is not a female .
but the more i thought about his question , so i thought that there could be something female in feminism .
this is supposed to be something that could give you something , on average , the average brains of male brains that make us happier for highly complex social relationships , and caring more about the protection for the protection .
so where the greeners were extremely reflective to try to figure out how individuals could be protected before the state , it is possible that if we put more mothers in this concept , we do more a concept of it , not just how we can protect them .
and maybe it &apos;s where we have to go to the future when we get to democracy about anatomy -- less about the individual body what identity is based on , and thinking more about relationships .
so , as people try to make a perfect connection , we think about what we can do for each other .
thank you .
i &apos;m jessi and this is my suitcase .
but before i show you what i &apos;ve got , i &apos;m going to make a very public confession , and that is , i &apos;m obsessed with outfits .
i love to find an opportunity to find a different colorfroster , crazy outfit , and in the last time , to photograph and blogging .
but i buy nothing new .
i get all my clothes from just a second hand in hhmarkets and in superprints .
ooh , thank you .
according to shopping is allowing me to reduce the impact of my garoobe on the environment , and also on my own level of money .
i meet all kinds of cool people ; my dollars is normally for a good purpose ; i see quite unique ; and i &apos;m going to buy it in my own personal search .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
will it be my size ?
am i going to like the color ?
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
if all the answers , i feel like i &apos;ve won .
i come back to my suitcase , and i &apos;ll tell you what i put in this exciting week at ted .
i mean , what do someone do with so many outfits ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i &apos;ve brought .
i brought seven some subpants , and that &apos;s all .
for exactly one week , everything i &apos;ve done in my suitcase .
i figured that i was going to have everything i wanted to wear , if i could only get to palm springs .
and since she &apos;s not heard of me as the woman who &apos;s walking around at ted in her underwear -- that is , i found some things .
and i really want to show you my outfits for this week .
does that sound good ?
while i &apos;m doing that , i &apos;m also going to give you some of the lessons that i believe , whether you believe it or not , for those adventdents , not to have new ones .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
i call this the radient tiger .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look great .
you can almost look great for less than 50 dollars .
this whole outfit , including the jacket , got me 55 , and it was the most expensive piece that i was wearing all this week .
monday : color is powerful .
it &apos;s almost impossible to be poor , if you wear hellred pants .
if you &apos;re happy , you move other happy people .
tuesday : adaptation is totally overrated .
i spent a lot of time in my life trying to be and adapt to myself at the same time .
just be who you are .
if you &apos;re surrounded with the right people , you won &apos;t just understand it , you &apos;ll also appreciate it .
wednesday : hold your inner child .
sometimes people say me , i looked like i &apos;m eating , or that i remember her seven year-old .
i like to smile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
thursday : confidence is key .
if you think you &apos;re looking at something good , it &apos;s almost safe .
and if you think they don &apos;t look good , they probably have right .
i grew up with a mother who taught me the day for day .
but only when i became 30 , i really understood what that means .
and i &apos;m going to summarize that for you .
if you believe you &apos;re inside and outside a wonderful person , there &apos;s nothing you can &apos;t wear .
so there &apos;s no excuse for someone here in this audience .
we should be able to pinch everything we want .
thank you .
friday : a universal truth -- five words : golden pailleites adapted to everything .
and finally , saturday : a small , unique , personal style of design is a great way to tell the world about one word without having to say a word .
it was always proven to me and again when in this week humans came to me , just because of what i was wearing , and i had great conversations .
obviously , it &apos;s not going to fit everything in my tiny suitcase .
so before i go home , i &apos;ll donate it back to brooklyn .
because the lesson i &apos;m trying to learn this week is that it &apos;s okay to leave .
i don &apos;t have to be emotionally aware of these things , because the same thing is going to be a different kind of crazy , colorful , comfuking of the outfit , which is just waiting for me if i just love a little in the heart and explore it .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good afternoon , everybody together .
i have something that i want to show you .
think of this as an image , flying image .
this is what we call our lab in our lab .
let me tell you a little bit about it .
now , if you take this picture -- i &apos;m originally italian , and every young boy in italy grows with this picture in his room , but the reason why i &apos;m showing you this is something that &apos;s really interesting in the formula in the last decades .
a couple of times ago , when they wanted to win a formula , they would take their budget and put their money on a good driver and a good car .
and if the car and the driver were good enough , then they won the race .
now , you know , if you want to win a race , actually something like this -- something that makes the car work in real time , some thousands of sensors that can pass information out of the car , and then change the information in real time and then change that car and change things in real time .
this would call you , in engineering teams , a real-time control system .
and basically , it &apos;s a system that comes from two parts -- a sense of a sense and an absolute case .
what &apos;s interesting today is the real-time control systems start to look at our lives .
our cities , in the last few years , were just equipped with networks and electronics .
they become a computer in the free .
and as a computer in the free , they start to react in other ways , and they &apos;re being driven .
if we make cities , it &apos;s actually a big deal .
by the way , i want to mention that cities are only two percent of the earth &apos;s land , but 50 percent of the world &apos;s population lives there .
they &apos;re 75 percent of energy consumption -- caused by 80 percent of co2 emissions .
so if we do something with the cities , it &apos;s a big thing .
beyond the cities , all this sense of view is pulling into objects of everyday life .
this is from an exhibition that paola antonelli for moma later , during summer , organized .
it &apos;s called &quot; me with me . &quot;
now all of our objects , our environment , begin to talk to us .
in a sense , it &apos;s almost as if any atom out there is going to be out there , a sensor and a driver .
and that changes radically the interaction that we have people with our environment .
in a way , it &apos;s almost like the old dream of michelangelo ...
you know , when michelangelo shaped the moses , it says that he took the hammer at the end , and he threw it on moses -- you can still see a little spot underneath -- and said , &quot; you know , perhé thermoparli ? why don &apos;t you negotiate ? &quot;
now , today , our environment begins to answer us .
i &apos;m just going to show you some examples -- again , with the idea of our environment and to do it .
let &apos;s start with that .
now the first project i &apos;d like to introduce you to is one of the first of our lab .
it emerged four and a half years ago in italy .
and what we did , actually , was to use new kinds of network that was used on the whole world -- that &apos;s a mobile phone web -- and anonymous and connecting information from that network to be used to understand how the city works .
the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
it was as a magician called the footprints of the world .
some of you will remember , it was as a magician against france , and then at the end , the headpress .
and no matter , italy won at the end .
now look at what happened on this day , just watching activity in the network .
here you see the city .
you can see in the middle of the mountains , the rundown tiber .
the morning , before the game .
you see the timeline .
early afternoon , people here and there , they &apos;re doing calls and moving .
the game starts -- silence .
france is a gateway . italy makes a gateway .
half the time people do a short call , go to toilet .
second half-time . end of normal play time .
first expansion , second .
cidane , in a moment of headphones .
italy . yeah .
well , this night , all of them went to the center to celebrate .
they saw the big yield .
the next day , all of them went to the center to meet the banana team and the prime minister at the same time .
and then everybody went down .
you see the image of the chamber circo massimo , where , since the roman age , the people go to celebration -- to have a big party , and you see the end at the end of the day .
now , this is just an example of how we can feel the city , in a way that we couldn &apos;t do it a few years ago .
just quickly , another example of feeling : this isn &apos;t about people , but for things that we use and consume .
now , we know all about where our things come from .
this is a map that shows you all the chips that have a mac computer , like they came together .
but we just know very little about where things go .
so in this project , we actually designed some small markers to track the garbage while it goes through the system .
so we started with some volunteers who have helped us a little bit more than a year ago , in seattle , to mark things that they threw away -- different kinds of things like you can see -- things that you would like to throw away .
then we have the little chips , the small brands , on the trash and started tracking it .
here are the results we &apos;ve just got .
from seattle ...
after a week .
with this information , we realized that there &apos;s a lot of inefficiencies in the system .
we can do the same things in action with less energy .
the data was not available before .
but this is happening a lot of unuseful transportation .
but the other thing is that we believe that when we see every day that the cup we throw away , it &apos;s not just that they &apos;re still going anywhere on the planet .
and the plastic bottle we &apos;re still hanging out every day .
and if we would show the people , then we can drive a behavioral change .
so this is the reason for this project .
my colleague at mit , assaf biderman , could tell you a lot more about the comparison and the many other wonderful things that you can do with perceive , but i &apos;d like to talk to you about the second part of our environment , and that &apos;s the guidance of our environment .
and the first project is something that we did a few years ago in zaragoza , spain .
it started with a question of the civil success that came to us and said that spain and south europe have a beautiful tradition to use in public places as part of the architecture .
and the question was : how could you connect technology , new technology ?
and one of the ideas that have been picked up in a division of labor was , imagine these little bits , and valves , magnetic valves , work that open and close .
they create what a water bias looks like from water .
and if this image points down , you can write , you can write patterns , images , text ads .
and you can approach him , and it will open up to let you jump through , like you can see on this picture .
well , we introduced the mayor belhole .
it really loves him .
and we got the assignment to design a building at the entrance of the expo .
we called it the digital water pavillion .
the whole building was out of water .
there &apos;s no doors or windows , but when they &apos;re approaching it , it will open up , and it &apos;s in it .
the roof was covered with water also .
and if it &apos;s down , if you want to reduce the syringes , you can even let the roof down .
or you could close the building and the whole architecture , like in this case , you know , that day , if you &apos;re going down the roof , you get images of people who were there and say , &quot; you &apos;ve destroyed the building . &quot;
no , they didn &apos;t break the building ; it &apos;s just that architecture nearly disappears .
here &apos;s how the building works .
you see the person who &apos;s wondering what &apos;s happening inside .
and here you see me when i tried to test the sensors that opened the water , not getting wet .
now , i should tell you what happened to one night when all the sensors stopped working .
but actually , it was a greater fun that night .
all the children from zaragoza came to the building , because the way they played with the building was quite different .
no longer a building that would open up to let them go , but a building that still had pause and holes in the water , you had to jump without getting wet .
and that was , for us , very exciting , because as architects , engineers , as designers , we think about how people use things that we design .
but the reality is always unpredictable .
and that &apos;s the beauty of creating things that will be used and interact with people .
here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical imaging points , the imagery of water and the projections on it .
and this is what made us think about the following project that i &apos;m showing you now .
imagine that these examples could really start flying .
imagine you could have small helicopter flying through the air , and each one of you with a little piece of education interact with the light -- almost like a cloud that can move through the space .
here &apos;s the video .
imagine a helicopter that you &apos;ve seen before , which is moving to others , completely in synchrony .
you can have this cloud .
you can have a kind of flexible screen or ad , like this -- a smooth formation in two dimensions .
or unregular but in three dimensions , where that is changing , the light is , not the position of education points .
you can play with different ways .
imagine the screen could just appear in different formats or sizes , in different ways .
but then the whole thing could be just a 3d cloud of imagery that they can go through and move through that they can look through a lot of , many ways .
here you see a real flyre-control control that goes down in the way that they are before .
if you turn the lights on , it looks like this , so as we saw it before .
imagine that every single one of people will be operated .
it could have any individual imaging that comes from people , from the movement of people or whatever .
i want to finish with you something here .
we &apos;ve worked with roberto bolle , one of the best ballet dancers of our time -- the étole at the metropolitan theater in new york and the scala in maan -- we took his movement in 3d to use them as a caryfire .
here you see robert to dance .
on the left side , you see the imaging points , the different genes .
it &apos;s at the same time a real-time 3d scan and a movement recording .
so they can make sense of all the movement .
you can do that all the time .
but then , once we have all the points , you can play with it and play with color movement and movement .
we want to use this as a possible impulse for the flyfire .
i want to show you the latest project that we &apos;re working on .
it &apos;s something that we work on for the olympics in london .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
the idea is again , imagine that this is what we bring back to people to do something , and to change the environment -- almost as much as we call it , &quot; cloud motion , &quot; but with a cloud .
imagine that every one of them can give a little donation for a point .
i think that the remarkable part of what &apos;s happening over the last few years is that we &apos;ve changed from a physical to digital world .
this has digitized everything , knowledge , and makes it available through the internet .
today , for the first time , we can -- and the campaign imamas showed this -- we can get from the digital world , from the self-organized forces to the physical world .
it can be , in our case , that we use it to design and create a symbol .
this is something that &apos;s built in the city .
but tomorrow , to put us the next challenges -- think about climate change or co2 emissions -- how can we move from the digital world to physics .
so the idea is that we actually engage people with each other where they do things together .
the cloud is again a cloud of imaging , in the same way that it &apos;s a cloud of particle particles .
and these particles are water , while our cloud is a cloud of imaging .
it &apos;s a physical material in london , but covered with education .
they can move inside and make different kinds of experiences .
you can actually look at it from the bottom , which is the most important moments for olympia 2012 , and you can use it as a kind of connection to the community .
so , the physical cloud in the sky , and something that you can go to the top of the sky , how londons of new mountain peaks .
you can go inside .
and a kind of digital insurgency in the night -- but as more important , a new kind of experience for everyone who wants to go to the top .
thank you .
as an artist , i &apos;m very important at the context .
through my work , i try to express that people are not separated by nature and that everything is connected .
the first time i was in antarctica , 10 years ago , where i saw my first ice mountains .
i made awe .
my heart rasts , i was angry while i was trying to grab what was in front of me .
the mountains around me had 60 feet of the water , and i could only say that this was a snowflake on a different snow sweke , year by year .
ice mountains are born as a bub of a glacier or just breaking out of ice cream .
every ice berg has its own individual personality .
they interact with their environment and their experiences .
some people like to give up and send up to the bitter end , while others can &apos;t withstand and get more dramatic together in one case .
if you look at an ice mountain , you think they &apos;re isolated , separated and alone , as we often see .
but the truth is far away from it .
as a ice plane melts , i put his pre-time atmosphere .
in the ice mountain , he melds herbials of water , which is a lot of life nails .
i go to my photographs of these ice mountains , when i would make portraits of my ancestors , in the mind that they exist in these individual eyeeyes , and never exist again .
it &apos;s not a death , if you melt ; it &apos;s not an end , it &apos;s a sequel of your cycle of life .
part of the ice in the ice mountains i &apos;m documenting is very young -- a few thousand years old .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
the last pictures i &apos;d like to show you is an ice mountain that i put in kekertatque in greenland .
very rarely , you &apos;re actually witnessing a bicycle iceberg .
here you see it .
on the left , you see a little boat .
this is about five feet long .
please look at the shape of the iceberg and where it &apos;s at the water line .
you can see here , he starts rolling , and the boat has moved to the other side , the man is there .
this is the average size of a country iceberg .
he calls about 120 feet from the water , or 40 meters .
and this video is in real time .
and just so , it shows you a different side of his personality .
thank you .
my life is truly blessed by the work of some amazing projects .
but the coolest thing i &apos;ve ever worked on was this guy .
his name is weep .
tweet was one of the leading graffiti artists of the 1980s .
then one day he came back from running and said , &quot; paps , my legs . &quot;
and that was the outbreak of that .
confused is completely paralyzed today .
he can only use his eyes .
i was standing to him .
i have a company that makes design and animation , so it &apos;s a very complex part of what we admire in the art world .
so we decided , tony -- and to support his thing .
i met with his father and his brother , and i said , &quot; we &apos;ll give you this money .
what are you going to do with it ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk to tony again .
i just want to talk to him again , and i said , &quot; wait a minute , is this not -- i saw stephen hawking -- can &apos;t everybody communicate with these devices ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , only if you listen to the higher life layer and have a remarkable insurance , you can do that .
normal people are not available . &quot;
and i said , &quot; how are you communicating ? &quot;
did anybody see the film &quot; butterfly and &quot; the bell ? &quot;
that &apos;s how they communicate -- their fingers are running along .
i said , &quot; very archaic , how can that be ? &quot;
so i came up with the need to just put out a check , and instead , i put a check from that i didn &apos;t have the least idea of how to dissolve it .
i commit to the place and the place to his brother and his father -- to say , &quot; well , my proposal is this way : tony &apos;s going to talk to him , we &apos;ll get a device back and we &apos;ll find a way to find his art again .
because it &apos;s a farce that someone who is wearing all this , it can &apos;t communicate . &quot;
so i spoke a few months later at a conference .
i met these people from grl , graffiti research lab and they have a technology that allows them to build a light on any surface and draw with a laser pointer on it , which is just the negative space .
so they &apos;re moving around and doing art installations like this .
they say that all things are shown up there , one cycle of life .
it starts with the sex , then the chimneys , then the bush moved around , and finally people are doing art .
but there was always a life cycle in your presentation .
so i went home , and i went to dinner with my wife and told her everything , and we thought , &quot; well , second , if there &apos;s this technology that you can use to use your eyes to control things , then we should find a way to find a laser that could drive a laser , so that it could be a great way to drive that . &quot;
that was the beginning of the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a lot of organization and lots of things , we have achieved some things .
first of all , we &apos;ve signed the insurance doors to the doors , and they actually get a device that he can communicate with -- an stephen hawque machine .
that was incredible .
and he &apos;s really extremely funny -- i call him yoda , because you talk to him , or get an email , and i think , &quot; i &apos;m so disworthy , this guy is incredible . &quot;
we also flew seven programmers from all over the world -- literally from all the rest of the world -- to us .
my wife , my children and i moved into the garage , and those hackers and programmers and the programmers and the recipes have taken our house .
many of our friends thought that we were beautiful dumb , and that we came back and all the images on the walls would be graffiti .
but for about two weeks , we have programmed , we went to the beach promenade in venice , my kids were involved , and we created this .
it &apos;s called eyeeyeand you can see the description .
this is a cheap sunglasses that we bought on the beach of venice , something copper wire and a few things out of the building market and the electric trade .
we took a cathe3-camera camera , they set up , they put it on a led light , and now we have a device that &apos;s freely available -- you can build it yourself , we can build the code free for free .
so we &apos;ve created a device that is completely free from constraints .
no insurance can be made .
no hospital .
now , every paralyzed can actually communicate with his eyes alone or drawing .
thank you .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so at the end of two weeks , we went back to tempts room .
i love this picture because it &apos;s the room of somebody else and that &apos;s his room .
now , there &apos;s all of these around the big unveiling .
and after about a year of planning , two weeks of work , nudelparties and running seases , made tony for the first time after seven years .
and this is an amazing picture because this is his life support system , and he looks over his life support system .
we tilted his bed so he can see it outside .
we created a projector against a wall of the park in front of the hospital .
and he drew back to the first time in his family , his family and friends -- and you can just imagine what a sense was on the parking lot .
and what we did was we had to break into parking space , so we felt as part of the spray scene .
at the end of sand, he gave us an email with the contents of the content , &quot; for the first time for seven years , i &apos;ve drawn something .
i feel like i was charged with water , and i finally moved out and pulled my head up , so i could breathe . &quot;
isn &apos;t that overwhelming ?
this is something like our fight .
that &apos;s keeping us on the pole and we keep moving .
and we need to improve a lot of that device .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s a magic plate .
and somebody who has such an artist potential deserve so much more .
so we &apos;re trying to figure out how to make it better , faster and stronger .
since that time , we have all kinds of recognition .
we won some prizes .
remember , it &apos;s free , none of us deserve it .
it comes from our own pockets .
so the drawings were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
armstrong ridte over us and then on december , the time magazine , as one of the 50 best innovations in 2010 , was really great .
the coolest thing is -- and that includes all the circle -- that this april , in april , is going to be an exhibition in the city of los angeles , called &quot; art of the streets . &quot;
and there may be so much the toughest practitioners of the street art scene -- banking , shepard acts , caws -- all these guys will be there .
so bolting is going to be part of the show , which is pretty rough .
so basically , i &apos;m about to say , if you see something that &apos;s impossible , then you can do it .
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this microphone , the eyewriter -- everything was impossible at some point .
make it possible -- everybody here .
i &apos;m not a programmer , and i &apos;ve never had anything to do with augenerative technology , but i just put a little bit out of it , and i &apos;m just surrounded by amazing people so we could put something on the legs .
and that question is to ask each one of you , and every single day , where you have something that needs to be done , if not now , when ? and if i don &apos;t , who ?
thank you .
so , i write for children , and i &apos;m probably probably america &apos;s most frequent children author .
and i always tell people that i don &apos;t want to be like a scientist .
you can have me as a farmer , or in leather , but nobody has ever elected farmers .
today i want to tell you about circles and disagreements .
well , an epiphany is usually something that you can find because you &apos;ve left it somewhere .
you go to the block and you take it as a revelation .
this is a painting of a circle .
one of my friends did it -- richard lovers .
it &apos;s the way that i want to tell you today .
my circle began in the &apos; 60s at high school at high school , ohio , where i was the classroom .
i was the one who was beaten every week in the bathroom green and blue , until a teacher saved my life .
she saved my life by letting me use the toilet in the teacher .
that &apos;s what she did .
she did it for three years .
and i had to go out of town .
i had a thumb , i had 85 dollars , and it proposed to san francisco in california -- i found a lover -- and in the back of the 1980s , i found it a lot of work in aids organizations .
about three or four years ago , i received a call at night in the middle of this teacher , who said , &quot; i have to see it .
i &apos;m sad that we never met as adults .
can you please come to ohio , and please come together with the man that i know you &apos;ve found now .
and i should mention that i have a tree of mine , and that i want you to stand up . &quot;
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
we looked at them , we laughed , we cried , and we knew they had to be in a hospice .
we found one for them , we brought them down , and we sat around them , and we gave them eight , because it needed to be necessary .
it was something we knew .
and just as the woman who wanted to learn me as adults to know me , they turned into a box of hands and became my hands .
what was happening was that the circle had closed , it had become a circle -- and the revelation of that i mentioned .
the revelation is , death is part of life .
she saved my life , and my partner and i saved her .
and you know , this part of life needs everything the rest of life needs .
he needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so glad that this is so often mentioned here .
he needs the same -- he would have to , love and pleasure . and it &apos;s on us to give these things .
thank you .
imagine a big explosion , as they go up on 1,000 feet .
imagine a plane full of smoke .
imagine a engine , which is a blade , darack , darack , darack , darack , darack , darack .
that sounds scary .
well , i had a unique place on this day ; i was sitting on 1d .
i was the only one who was able to talk to the airport .
so i just looked at it , and they said , &quot; no problem , we &apos;ve got some birds . &quot;
the pilot had already turned the machine and we weren &apos;t so far away .
you could see manhattan .
two minutes later , three things happened simultaneously .
the pilot did the machine after the hudson river .
it &apos;s usually not the route .
it turns the engine off .
imagine a sound plane .
and then he said three words -- the most potent words i &apos;ve ever heard .
he says , &quot; get to the beating . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the staff .
i could see it in your eyes , there was horror , life was at the end .
i want to share with you three things that i &apos;ve learned about this day .
i learned that in a moment everything is different .
we have this living plan , we have these things that we want to do in life , and i thought about all the people i wanted a hand to do , and it didn &apos;t do all the fences that i wanted to do .
while i was thinking about it later , a saying was , &quot; i collect bad wa . &quot;
because when the wine is , and the person is there , then i open him .
i never want to move anything in life .
and these urgency , this goal , really changed my life .
the second thing i learned about this day -- and that was when we failed george washington bridge , so pretty much around hair -- i thought , man , there &apos;s one thing i really regret .
i had a good life .
in my own humanity and with my mistakes , i went to become better in everything i grabbed .
but i &apos;ve also given my ego to my own ego .
and i took the time that i was wasted for meaningful things , with people who mean something .
and i thought about the relationship with my wife , to friends .
and after that , when i thought about it , i decided to replicate negative energy from my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
i didn &apos;t submit two years to my wife .
it feels great .
i &apos;m not trying to have , right ? i choose to be happy .
the third thing i learned -- and this is when the inner clock begins , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 , ... &quot;
you see the water coming .
i said , &quot; please fly into the air . &quot;
i don &apos;t want to cut that thing down in 20 parts as you know it from documces .
as we fall away , i had this feeling , human being to die , not terrifying .
almost like that , we prepare for our lives .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and that sadness really fell in a thought , which is that i just want to one thing .
i wish i could see my kids growing up .
about a month after that , i came up with a performance of my daughter -- first graders , not a lot of artistic talent ...
... not .
and i &apos;m cooking , i &apos;m like a little kid .
and in the world everything made sense to me .
i realized , by the time , by connecting the dots that it was just about being a great father .
more than anything , everything else is my only goal to be a good father .
i became a miracle of not dying that day .
i got another gift , which is to see the future , and come back to life .
my call to everybody who &apos;s flying today is , imagine what happens on your flight -- don &apos;t you -- but imagine it , and how would you change ?
what would you do , which you put up because you think they &apos;d be there forever ?
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in it ?
and more than anything , are you the best parents you can only be ?
thank you .
the idea behind the map computer worm is quite straightforward .
we don &apos;t want iran to build bomb .
the most important site for development of nuclear weapons is the ancient incentives in nato .
the gray boxes you see here , these are real-time control systems .
now , when it works to us , the systems that pay attention and valves control , then we can actually create a lot of problems with the centrifuge .
these gray boxes don &apos;t run with winpers software ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
but if we can do it , an effective wind virus on a laptop is being used by a warning engineer to conweak this gray box , then we &apos;re in business .
and that &apos;s the planning behind phxnet .
so we start with a wind dropper .
the use of data is transgenerated in the gray box , damaged the centrifuge and the irish nuclear energy program -- mission .
that &apos;s a child game , right ?
i want to tell you how we found that .
when we started to map our research six months ago , it was absolutely unknown , which was the purpose and purpose of this construction .
the only thing that we knew is very , very complicated what the windmill -- part of it , the drone -- part of it was made by an granad squon , and it was made by the total .
and it seemed to have something to do with these gray boxes , these real-time control systems .
this is our attention , and we started a lab project where we infected our environment , and we studied this constructed .
and then something weird happened .
stuxnet was like a lab rat who didn &apos;t like our cheese -- sniffy , but didn &apos;t want to eat it .
that didn &apos;t make sense in my eyes .
and after we tested with different kinds of cheese , i went to see that this was a target attack .
completely on a particular destination .
the dropper is active on the gray box when a special configuration was discovered , even if that special program , which is trying to get infected in this goal .
and if not , you don &apos;t do anything .
so , the wecking really my interest and we started working almost around the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
it could say , for example , a us- american power plant , or a chemical plant in germany .
so we should soon find out what the target is .
so extrahiated and decomated us , and we found that it &apos;s built in two digital warheads -- a smaller and a larger one .
and we also realized that they were very professionally designed by people who obviously had all of this information .
they knew all bits and bytes they had to attack .
you probably knew the size size of the machine .
so they knew everything .
and if you &apos;ve got to get rid of the droxnet of stuxnet complex and high-tech , let me tell you , the data is a science for itself .
it &apos;s much more sophisticated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
here you see a clip from that attack code .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 lines code .
it looks like old-fashioned reptiles .
and i want to tell you how we were able to be smart in this code .
so , first of all , what we were looking for was systems working , because we know what to do .
and then we looked for tiaching and data structures , trying to bring this with the real world in connection -- with potential goals in the real world .
so we needed theories about these goals that we could draw or disprove .
so , in order to make these theories , we &apos;re going to go to memory that it &apos;s definitely very high-level sabotage , it has to be a high-quality goal , and it &apos;s very likely to be in iran because most of the infections have been raised .
now , in this area there &apos;s not multiple targets .
it &apos;s basically walking beyond the buffer nuclear power plant and on the uranium incentives in natasha .
so i said to my assistant , &quot; bring me a list of all experts for centered and power plants . &quot;
and i called them up , and zapled their knowledge to compare their knowledge to what we found in the code and in the data .
and that worked very well .
so , it was possible to bring the little digital warhead with the rotorl .
the rotor is that moving part within the centrifuge , these black objects that you see .
and if you &apos;re manipulating the speed of this roir , you &apos;re actually able to crack the rotor and eventually get the centrifuge down .
what we &apos;ve also found is that the goal of the attack was actually going to happen , and it &apos;s incredibly easy to make -- obviously in trying to keep the engineers in trying to get out of it .
the big digital warhead -- we got a glimpse by looking at very precisely data and data structures .
so for example , the number 164 stivers really looks out of this code ; you can &apos;t miss it .
i started working on the scientific literature of how these centriism are built in natasha , and found that they &apos;re structured in so-called casdie , and each cascade contains 164 .
so that made sense , put it together .
and it was even better .
this centriism in iran is something called a half of them .
and guess what we found in the attack code ?
it &apos;s almost identical structure .
so again , that &apos;s really good .
and this gave us great confidence for that that we studied here .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , that didn &apos;t go like this .
these results have been done by several weeks of work .
and often we just ran into a dead car , and we had to collect ourselves .
anyway , we found that both digital warheads actually went into one and the same goal , but from different directions .
the little warhead takes a kaskade , and it goes down the rotors and it breaks it down and the big warhead comes with six casbs in interaction and transmitting valves .
so , in large and whole , very hopeful , we &apos;ve actually determined what the target is .
it &apos;s nato and it &apos;s only natasha .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that others could be made by stuxnet .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we discovered -- really made me out of the sowels .
there &apos;s the gray box down there , and you see it in the top .
now , what this thing is caused is that the results of sensors start off -- so for example sensors and vibration sensors -- and it provides legitimate code to be able to run with false data .
and in fact , this is the wrong data of stuxnet before .
so it &apos;s just like in hollywood movies , where during the chase hunt , the surveillance agencies are fed up with the polling videos .
that &apos;s cool , isn &apos;t it ?
the idea of this is obviously not just the machine interface in the control room .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and more aggressive .
the idea is to cover a digital security system .
we need digital security systems where a human machine can &apos;t respond fast enough .
so , for example , in a power station , if the big steam turbine gets too fast , you have to open it up within milliseconds .
of course , this cannot be done by a human machine leader .
so that &apos;s where we need digital security systems .
and when the endangered people are , really bad things can happen .
the power plant can explode .
and neither the machine leaders , even the security system will notice .
that &apos;s scary .
but it gets worse .
and what i &apos;m saying is very important .
think about it . that attack is universal .
he has nothing to do with centrifusion , with uranium .
so for example , he would work as well -- in a power station or a car factory .
it &apos;s generic .
and you don &apos;t have to -- when the owner -- you don &apos;t have to get the use of data on a usb stick like we saw at stuxnet .
you could also use ordinary worm technology to spread .
you just have to spread it as far as possible .
and when you do that , eventually you get a cyberweapon of mass destruction .
that &apos;s the consequence that we have to confront .
so unfortunately , the greatest number of goals is not in the middle east .
they &apos;re in the united states , in europe and japan .
so all these green areas , these are the richest environments .
we need to confront the consequences and we start getting better .
thank you .
i have a question .
ralph , it was reported very much , that people think that the mossad is the main organization behind it .
is that your opinion ?
okay , you really want to know ?
yeah . okay .
i think the mossad is involved , but the driving force is not israel .
so the driving force is the cybersuperpower .
there &apos;s only one and that &apos;s the united states -- luckily , fortunately .
because otherwise our problem is even bigger .
thank you for coming up with us . thanks ralph .
i spent the last few years to place in situations that are usually very difficult and somehow dangerous .
i went to jail -- hard .
i worked in a coal plant -- dangerous .
i filmed in war areas -- hard and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days , nothing like eating this -- fun at the beginning , a little difficult in the middle , very dangerous at the end .
in fact , i &apos;ve exposed to the biggest part of my career to terrible situations , and all of this just for trying to study social rockang that they are , and they &apos;re interesting , and hopefully in a way , what they make for the audience and make them accessible .
so when i knew i would come here to look at the world of branding and sponsors , i knew i was doing something slightly different .
some of you may have heard that i turned a few weeks ago to ebay .
i sent a few facebook messages , some twitter news , and i gave people the opportunity to get the name of the tedtalk in 2011 .
really , a few happy people and companies , wisconsin profits and non-profits , they got the chance -- because i &apos;m sure chris anderson will never let that happen -- the name of being able to buy the name of the talk .
so what you &apos;ve got was this : you name your name here : my tedtalk , from which you don &apos;t know what the subject is going to be , and the only way you could ever fly to the content is , especially if i stand your company for your involvement .
but again , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
you know how many people watch tedtalks ?
a lot of them .
that &apos;s just the job .
so despite this warning , i knew anyone would buy the name rights .
now if you asked me this a year ago , i wouldn &apos;t have been able to tell you that with certainty .
but in the new project i work on , my new film , we study the world of marketing , advertising .
as i said , i &apos;ve been walking into some pretty horrible situations over the course of the years , but nothing allowed me to prepare nothing to do with anything so difficult and so dangerous as with these guys in a room .
you know , i had the idea for a movie .
what i want to do is to make a film about behavioral customization , marketing and advertising , where all the film is funded by concrete , marketing and advertising .
and the film is called &quot; the doodle ever ever . &quot;
so what happens in &quot; the holocaust lobby ever , &quot; is that everything from top to bottom , from the beginning to the end , right from the cover to the end , that you &apos;re going to see in the movie , that &apos;s the brand brand .
now this brand , the quality of the liquid stadium .
these people are going to be connected to the film in the face forever .
and so the film is going to look at this whole idea -- that &apos;s what ? in infinity , forever ?
i &apos;m a redundant person .
that was more to the concrete .
it was &quot; in e, forever . &quot;
but we &apos;re not just going to have the brand x as a cover , but we &apos;re going to make sure we &apos;re going to sell every possible category in the movie .
so maybe we &apos;ll sell a shoe and it will be the greatest shoe that they ever carried ...
the greatest car you have ever taken out of , &quot; the doodle ever ever , &quot; the greatest drink that they have ever had , an awareness of &quot; the doodle . &quot;
so the idea is , apart from showing that brands are part of life , actually , to bring it to the film ?
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
the goal of the whole film is transparency .
you &apos;ll see the whole thing in the movie .
so this is the whole concept , the whole film , from the beginning to end .
and i would love if ceg would help to do this .
you know , it &apos;s funny because when i first heard it , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience .
i don &apos;t know how to be wired people .
have you a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use &quot; perspective , &quot; because that has a negative connotation -- but you know how it &apos;s going to evolve ?
how much money will it take to realize that ?
1.5 million .
i think it &apos;s going to be hard to meet , but i think it &apos;s definitely worth making some really familiar brands .
now , who knows when the film comes out , we may see a muwn vollidial .
what do you think the answer will be ?
the answer becomes extremely likely &quot; no . &quot;
but is it a difficult thing because of the film or a difficult thing to do ?
jk : both .
so , it &apos;s not that optimistic .
so , sir , can you help me ? i need help .
i can help .
okay .
fantastic .
we need to think about what brands are .
yeah .
if you look at the people you have to do with it ...
there are some places that we can turn to .
put the camera out .
i thought , &quot; well , imagine the camera , &quot; that we wanted to have a background conversation .
it turns out it meant in fact , &quot; we want nothing to do with your film . &quot;
and just so all these companies disappeared , one after one .
no one wanted to do something about the movie .
i was amazed .
they didn &apos;t want to have anything to do with the project .
and i was confused because i thought the whole concept , the idea of advertising was to present your product as many people as possible , so many people as you can see .
especially in the world today , on this interface of new and old media and the broken media landscape -- it &apos;s not the idea of being in this new scenario , that the masses of this message is bringing .
no , that was what i thought .
but look , the problem was that my idea had a fatal mistake , and it was the following .
actually , no , that wasn &apos;t the mistake at all .
that would have been no problem at all .
that would have been okay .
but what this picture is , is a problem .
see , if you put transparency in the google search , this is one of the first images that appears .
i really like your kind , sergey brin . now .
this was the problem : transparency -- free from deception and door , just to find out , and look through it ; smell of mindability and access to information , especially in terms of business .
you know , we currently hear a lot about transparency .
our politicians say it , our president says , even our ceo says it .
but as far as it comes , it should be implemented , something is happening .
but why ? well , transparency is scary -- like this weird bear , who still scratches .
it &apos;s unpredictable -- like these strange landland .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
what else is risky ?
a whole dish is cool .
this is very risky .
so when i started talking to companies , and tell them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to make a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
you see , when i was a kid , and my father got me lying -- and there he sits and looks at me with this view -- he would say , &quot; my son , there &apos;s three versions in every story .
there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the real version . &quot;
so you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the real story .
but because only one company , an agency ready to help us -- and also , because i knew john bond and richard kirshentree for years -- i found that i had to do it alone , i had to go to the middle of companies .
so what they suddenly started to understand -- or what i started to understand -- was that if you start talking to these companies , the idea of how your brand understood is a greater problem .
i have friends doing the big , gigantic hollywood movies , and i have friends who do little therapties movies like me .
and my friends who make large , gigantic hollywood movies , say that the reason your movies are so successful , the brand partners is that they have .
and then my friends , who are doing little therapties movies , &quot; well , how do we deal with these big , giant hollywood movies ? &quot;
and the film is called &quot; the doodle . &quot;
so what are we going to see in the movie ?
whenever i go on the road , and whenever i open the medical closet , you &apos;ll see ban deodorant .
and every time i say somebody in the interview , i can say , &quot; are you good enough for this interview ?
are you so far ? you see a little bit nervous .
i want to help you to calm down .
so maybe you should put a little bit of this in front of the interview . &quot;
and then we offer one of these great grim grim .
either &quot; flms. &quot; or &quot; paradise &quot; or &quot; paradise . &quot;
we &apos;re being equipped by both men and for women -- solid , or a stick , whatever .
that &apos;s the short conversion .
now , i can answer all of your questions and give you a fine version .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
as you &apos;ve talked about the smaller films , we &apos;re a challenge .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other brands .
so these things -- you know , people remember ban -- that &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested .
what would you like to describe ?
ban is therapist .
that &apos;s a great question .
it &apos;s obsolete technology .
technology is not the way you should describe something that someone is doing under the axks .
we &apos;re talking about bold , fresh .
i think &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word that this category is really good , unlike fighting odor and humidity .
it keeps you fresh .
how can we keep it longer -- better fresh , more fresh fresh , three fresh .
these things have a more positive effect .
and that &apos;s a million-dollar company .
what about me ? what about prints ?
i have to talk to the man on the street that are like me , otto-normal-consumers .
you should tell me something about my brand .
how would you describe your brand ?
hmmm , my brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i really like beautiful clothes .
&apos; 80s revs on skanesses , except on the blackday .
all right , what &apos;s your brand ?
unique .
i think the gene , the style that i have , is probably &quot; dark glamour . &quot;
i like a lot of black colors , many gray notes and so on .
but usually i have a accessories , like sunglasses , or a jewelry , or a piece of stuff .
if dan would be a brand , he would probably be a classic puppet of cabrio .
the brand , the brand i &apos;m , is i would say , spontaneous fly .
voice 2 : part hippie , partly yogi , part of the world -- i don &apos;t know .
man 3 : i &apos;m the bemuseum guy .
i sell to the entire country in the entire country .
so i think that my brand is .
this is my brand in my little , distorfied industry .
man 4 : my brand is fedex because i was thrilled .
man 5 : brand praposous alcohoum write .
is that ?
lawyer : i &apos;m an antere-mark .
i &apos;m tom .
well , we can &apos;t be all the tom-brand , but i often look at the interface of darkglamour and spontaneous fly .
and what was noticed was that i needed a experts .
i needed somebody who could get into my head , someone who could really help me understand what you call &quot; branded personality . &quot;
and so i found a company called olson zelman in pittsburgh burg .
they have companies like neaf , febreze , hallmark , to discover that brand personality .
if they could do it for me , they could also help me .
they brought their pictures , yes ?
i did . the first painting is a picture of my family .
tell me just a little bit about how this is connected to your thoughts and feelings of yourself .
these are the people who form the world &apos;s view .
tell me about this world .
md : this world ? i think the world is the world in which you live -- like humans around one , the friends , the family , the family , the way you live your life , the work and so forth .
all of these things come and start from a place , and to me , and start with my family in west virginia .
what &apos;s the next thing you want to talk about .
the next one . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
what &apos;s the context of the mind and feelings of them ?
it &apos;s like i like to be .
i like things that are different .
i like things that are special . i like special things .
tell me about the &quot; why &quot; phase -- what does it bring us ?
what &apos;s the machete ? what puppetry are they currently ?
why is it important to launch novelty ? what does the red point represents ?
tell me a little bit about that part .
a little more about them , they &apos;re not .
what other metals are they going through ?
... does not have to be afraid . what kind of rollteraster are they ?
eeeeee ! no , thank you .
thank you for patience .
yeah . all right .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to be made of .
there was a lot of crazy things going on .
the first thing that i saw was this idea that your brand personality is two separate parts , but it has the end of the line -- the morgan bullop &apos;s brand is eight / 7 .
it &apos;s very good .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction with it .
and i think some companies are just going to focus on a strength , rather than both .
a lot of companies tend to -- and that &apos;s the human nature -- things that you &apos;re not sure about , you &apos;re going to be frightened , that these elements , and that you &apos;re going to welcome them to actually be in a positive , and it &apos;s a committed chess train .
what other brands do ?
the first one is a classic , apple .
and you can see it here , target , wii , mini of mini coopers and jetblue .
now , there &apos;s brands and eight-em tags , these things that come and go , but a replaying , eight-time brand is a pretty strong thing .
an eight-story , brand brand . how is your brand ?
if someone asked you to describe your brand identity , your brand personality , how would you ?
you put it up , is you something that brings blood into wales ?
or are they more likely to be a downlevel ?
are they something that &apos;s a little quiet , more urbanized , conservative ?
greenhouse attributes are things that are replaying , fresh like the fresh prince , period of time , adventceous , and you know , like flol flynn , and agile , glorious , magical , glorious , nasty like gandalf .
or are they more like a downlevel ?
are they eight , and mons like 300 ?
are they allowed , traditionally , ex-, compromise , compassionate like oprah ?
are they reliable , stable , family , secure , born , heighful , mindful , and like the dalai lama ?
over the film , we had more than 500 companies that were up and down companies and the &quot; no , &quot; because they didn &apos;t want to be part of the project .
they didn &apos;t want to have anything to do with this film because they had no control , no control over the finished product .
but it &apos;s going to be 17 of us , 17 , who were willing to stop these control , who wanted to do with someone who wanted to do it with someone like me and to tell us how to tell stories that we don &apos;t normally have to tell .
they gave us the ability to tell the story of neuromarketing , such as we tell the story in this movie that you &apos;re using mri to be the lustm of the brain , and to make advertising as well as films .
we went to sao paulo where public advertising was banned .
in the entire city , for five years , no longer evidence , no poster , no tube , nothing .
and we drove in school districts where companies were moving away from their way to the schools , in america .
the incredible thing for me is that the projects i got was most of the feedback , or where i had the biggest success , those are where i directly interact with things .
and that &apos;s what these brands have done .
because they went around the middle man , they went around the service , and they said the service may not really have their interest in the sense .
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artist directly .
i &apos;m going to work with him and create something completely different , something that makes people think of the world &apos;s image .
and how did that do for you ? what it successful ?
well , since the film in the sundance film festival , we can look at this .
according to burrgar was the preception in january , and since -- and that &apos;s not even the whole thing -- there were 900 million calls of that film .
this is actually just a period of two / 2 weeks .
this is just online -- no press , no television .
the film hasn &apos;t been balanced yet .
it &apos;s not even online . no offensions .
it &apos;s not in other countries .
now , the film has gained a very big momentum .
and this is not bad for a project where almost every ad agency that we were talking about has been recommended to make the finger of it .
something that i firmly believe is that if you take your chance to take risks , you get risks in these risks .
i think when you keep people off , you get them closer to failure .
i think that if you train your employees to avoid risks , you save the whole company to get a profit .
i feel that we need to encourage people to take risks .
we need to encourage people to have no fear of opportunities that they might be afraid of .
finally , in advance , we should welcome the fear .
we should put the bear in the cage .
they welcome the fear . they welcome the risk .
one big lion , we welcome the risk .
and finally , we should welcome transparency .
today , more than ever before , a little bit of honesty brings us very far .
and that , with honesty and transparency , my total talk called &quot; you welcome transparency , &quot; was presented to you from my good friends of emc , which paid $ 7100 to the name of ebay .
big data is transformed for organizations around the world in big opportunities .
emc : &quot; you welcome transparency &quot;
thank you .
now , morgan , in the name of transparency , this is what happens to the $ 7100 ?
that &apos;s a great question .
i &apos;ve got a check in my pocket , put on top of the ted organization of the ted organization , the saop foundation -- a $ 7100 to fund my ted performance in the next year .
my name is amit .
18 months ago , i was doing something else in google , and i went to make something with museums and art . my chief , which is now , gave me green light .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of fun negotiations and stories , i can tell you , with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the demo .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we did this .
i think my personal view is very simple with this slide and her access .
i grew up in india .
i became a great training -- i didn &apos;t shave -- but i had no access to many museums and this art .
when i went traveling , and these museums , i started to learn a lot .
and while i was working for google , i tried to make this desire -- to make art accessible -- with technology together .
we then created a team , a great team , and we started with this .
i &apos;m probably going to start with the demonstration and tell you some interesting things that have happened since the start .
so you &apos;re just going to test into a flash projection .
you can see in all these museums here .
there &apos;s uffizi , moma , the hermitk , the righ , van gogh .
i even come to one of my favorite , the metropolitan museum of species in new york .
you come in two ways -- very simple .
click , and wireless , you &apos;re in this museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where you are -- bombay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t make any difference .
you go around and you survive .
you want to be engaged in the museum ?
you open the map , and you jump on a click .
they are , they want to go to the end of the gang .
only further . fun .
bless them .
thank you , but the best thing is coming .
so i &apos;m in front of a favorite images of my favorite images of breter in the met .
i see this plusmark .
if the museum gave us the picture , it click on it .
now , this is one of the images .
these are all metadata .
those of you who are really interested in art can click here -- but i &apos;m going to go away now .
this is one of the images we put in the so-called called the giorn ii technology .
this picture for example has about 10 billion imaging points , i think .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you get for 10 billion points ? &quot;
that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to show you .
you can zoom in and zoom in .
you see something funny here .
i love this guy ; his expression is unaffordable .
but then you really want to go deep .
and so i started playing around , and i realized there &apos;s something going on .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
i went close , and i realized that these kids actually set something .
i was looking at a little bit earlier with a couple of familiar things , and in fact , i found out that it &apos;s a game called squail , where a goose is being beaten at the bottom of the night tuesday with a stick .
apparently , it was pretty popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
to really close , you can go to the cracks .
just to give you the perspective , i &apos;m going to see you see what you get .
here we were , and this is the painting .
the best one is still -- in a second .
let &apos;s jump fast to moma , back in new york .
another favorite picture of me , starnight .
for example , it was about finding details .
but what if you want to see the pinch ?
and what only , if you want to see like van gogh , how did you create this masterpiece ?
you zoom in . you can really go in .
i &apos;m going to zoom in in one of my favorite words of this picture until i really get to the cracks .
this is stary , probably never before .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
there are many more , but i &apos;m missing time .
this is really cool , it &apos;s called collections .
every one of them , everybody -- just whether or arm , whether they have a great house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
you can go and build your own museum online -- from all these images , you can make your own collection .
very simple , they go in -- and i created this , called the power of the therapist -- you can zoom around .
this is it in the national trials .
you can put it all on note , send your friends , and start a conversation about what you feel when you look at these masterpieces .
i think finally , the main thing for me is that all the wonderful things don &apos;t come from google .
they don &apos;t even come from museums .
i should not say that .
they come from the artists .
and that was a bug for me .
i mean , i hope that with this digital medium of art , we &apos;re going to represent it right online .
the biggest question that i asked you recently is , &quot; did you do that to replicate the experience of a museum ? &quot;
the answer is no .
it &apos;s supposed to be the experience .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . thank you .
thank you .
this is a representation of your brain . your brain can be divided into two halves .
this is the left half that &apos;s the logical side , and then half the rights that &apos;s intuitive .
if we had a measure to measure the apite every hemisphere , we could present your brain .
for example , those guys who are fully logical .
this would be somebody who &apos;s completely intuitive .
now , where would you put your brain on this scale ?
some of us may have chosen for one of these extremes , but i think , for most people in the audience , their brain looks like this -- with a high apned , which is at the same time in both hemispheres .
it &apos;s not like they &apos;re both exclusive or whatever .
you can be logical and intuitive .
and so i see myself as one of the people , with most other experimental quantum physics , who need a good proportion of logic to put together the complex ideas .
but at the same time , we need a good amount of intuition to actually carry on experiments .
how do we develop this intuition ? well , we love to play things .
so we go out and play with it and then look like it &apos;s reacting , and then we start to develop our intuition .
they &apos;re basically doing the same thing .
so one of the intuitive things that they &apos;ve developed over the years is probably that one thing can only be at a place at the same time .
i mean , it can be strange to think that one thing is at the same time at two different places , but they were not born with this idea , they &apos;ve developed them .
i remember seeing a child playing on a floor threshold .
he was a little kid , and he wasn &apos;t very good at it , and he constantly fell .
but i bet that it &apos;s going to be a very valuable lesson , which is a very valuable lesson , which is that the big things don &apos;t just leave you , and that you stay in a place .
and this is a great conceptual model of the world , so long it doesn &apos;t matter .
it would be a horrible model for a particle physicist , because they don &apos;t play the surface of dirt , but with these little odd particles .
and if you play with your particles , you ask all kinds of weird things -- how they &apos;re flying directly through walls , or that they can be at the same time at two different places .
and so they wrote all these observations , and they called them the theory of quantum mechanics .
this was the physics of physics a few years ago ; it took quantum mechanics to describe the small , tiny particles .
but you didn &apos;t need them to describe the great mundane objects around us .
it doesn &apos;t really enjoy my intuition and maybe just because i don &apos;t have to play with particles .
well , i sometimes play with you , but not very often .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
i mean , nobody ever saw a particle .
but my logical side doesn &apos;t really enjoy it .
because if all things are made of particles and all these particles , the rules of quantum mechanics should not just follow the rules of quantum mechanics ?
i don &apos;t see reason why it &apos;s not supposed to be .
so i would feel clear better with the whole thing if we could somehow show that everyday objects follow the rules of quantum mechanics .
so , a few years ago , i did this .
i created one .
this is the first object you can see in the quantum mechanical position .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and you can see that green dot there in the middle .
this is the piece of metal i &apos;m going to talk about .
this is a picture of the object .
i &apos;m going to do something bigger here . we look right here in the center .
and here &apos;s a really big close-up of this little piece of metal .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little bit of metal it &apos;s shaped like a spring board and it &apos;s about the edge above .
so i made this thing like a computer chip doing a computer .
i went a clean space with new silicon slices , and racked for 100 hours of all the big devices .
for the last bit , i had to build my own machine -- to make this kind of a swimming pool of hole and get the thing .
this thing has the ability to be in quantum mechanical superposition , but it takes a little help to do it .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you know how uncomfortable it is to be a full elevator ?
i mean , if i &apos;m alone in the elevator , i &apos;m going to do all kinds of weird things , but then other people go up and i &apos;m going to stop doing all these things because i don &apos;t want to get rid of it , or , frankly , they &apos;re free .
so quantum mechanics says that unmoving objects will feel equally .
they &apos;re not just people who are not just people , but also the light , the light that seems to them , and the wind that goes over to them and the heat of the space .
and so we knew that when we wanted to see that this piece of metal acts quantum mechanical , we had to get out of it all the time .
and we did that .
we turned out the light , put it in a vacuum and put it all out of the air , and cool it up to almost right now in the elevator , was the piece of metal .
so we measured his movement .
we found that it really moves .
instead of , it &apos;s easy to be there , it would vibrate . the way it vibrafied it was like this -- how to expand and together and put it together .
we gave him a little push , we could get it to vibrate at the same time and not vibrate -- something which is just in quantum mechanics .
so what i &apos;m just telling you is what really fantastic .
what does it mean for an object to vibrate and not vibrating ?
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
so the first case : all the trillions of atoms that are made of the piece of metal are silent , and at the same time , the same atoms move down and down .
just too precise periods of time .
the rest of the time is conocalized .
that means that every atom is at the same time in two different places , which is that the entire piece of metal is in two different places .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
really .
it was worth opening up for all this year in the clean room , because , check the difference difference between one atom and this piece of metal is about the same as the difference between metal and you .
so if a single atom can be at the same time at two different places , this piece of metal can be in two different places , why not ?
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logical side says .
so , imagine you were at the same time at multiple places , how would that feel ?
how would you deal with it that your body is delocalized ?
there &apos;s another aspect in history .
when we warm it up , the light turned on and looked into the box , we saw that the piece was always in a piece there .
and so , i had to develop this new intuition that it looks like all the objects in the elevator are actually emant objects in a small space .
you hear a lot about how quantum mechanics says that everything is connected to everything .
now , that &apos;s not quite right .
there &apos;s more of that , it goes deeper than that .
it &apos;s that these connections , their connections with all the things around them , literally define who they are , and that &apos;s the profound and strange of quantum mechanics .
thank you .
in 2007 , i decided that we should be re-concepts as we think about economic development .
it should be our goal that if families are trying to think about where they live and work , they gave them the opportunity to select between at least one hand of different cities that all of them are in competition .
now we &apos;re far away from this goal .
there are billions of people in developing countries who don &apos;t even have a single city available to them .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they &apos;re so much more valuable than building it .
so we could very easily do the world with duzend , maybe even hundreds of new cities .
now this may sound absurd for you , if you &apos;ve never thought about new cities .
they just trade the building from homes to the cities .
imagine that half of the people who want to live in homes did already , but the other half didn &apos;t .
you could try to expand the capacity of the already existing apartments .
but you know what they would be able to do , in these homes and their environment , is to avoid the laws of disposal and to leverage them .
so it turns out to be very difficult to get all these extensions .
but you could go to a completely new place , which is a completely new block of housing , the laws would give you a building and not prevent it .
so i suggested that governments create new spaces that provide enough space for a city and gave them a name : charter cities .
i found out that , about the same time , jafour and octavio have thought about the challenge of a reform in honduras .
they knew that every year about 75,000 honans left their country to go to the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to make sure that these people could stay in their country and can do exactly the same thing in hong .
now , in this place , jafour to octavio said , &quot; what if we &apos;re going to go out of an uninterrupted land of our country -- what if we just give them a message -- a part of the american embassy , a part of the eastern world , and when people want to go under the canadian rules , and they &apos;re going to be able to work on the ground , what are they going to do ? &quot;
in the summer of 2009 , honduras suffered under a very strong distribution .
in the next plantation election , pepe lobo would be in a removable , whose program , both clinical zealand , promised .
he asked octavio to become his stable check .
in the meantime , i was preparing a talk at tedglobal .
through improvement , trying and through the study of consumers , i &apos;ve tried to reduce this complicated concept of the charter city , essentially .
the first point , the importance of laws , laws , determine that you may not be able to dismiss existing owners .
we &apos;re paying attention to new technologies , but for the progress of progress , it needs technology and laws , and it &apos;s usually the laws that hold us back .
in the fall of 2010 , a friend of guatemala octavio sent the link to the tedtalk .
again , it showed him four .
they were calling me .
and said , &quot; let &apos;s present the head of our country . &quot;
so we met in december in december of a hotel in miami .
i was trying to make sure how valuable cities are , how much value they are than they cost .
and i used this chart to show how valuable rohland is in a place like new york . think about a space in some cases of thousands of dollars .
but it was a pretty abstract discussion , at a point when there was a pause , octavio said , &quot; paul , could we look at the tedtalk . &quot;
so the tedtalk asked in very simple form that a charter city is a place where it &apos;s uninhabited in the beginning of uninhabited land , a greener contract that holds the laws there and the people who are concerned with it , either under those rules or not .
so , i was asked by the president of honduras who meant that we have to make this project , that it &apos;s important , and that this is the way our country is moving .
i was asked to come to teguciik , and again , at the fourth , january of january , a talk .
so , i gave a bunch of facts to the facts that have a graph like this , which is trying to figure out that if you want to make a lot of value in a city , it &apos;s a very large city .
this is a picture of city denver , and the sketch represents the new airport , which was built in denver .
this airport alone has a 100 square kilometers .
so i &apos;ve tried to convince hondurans if you want to build a new city , you start with an area of at least 1,000 square kilometers .
these are more than 250 thousand acres .
polite , everybody applaked .
faces of the audience were very serious and carefully .
the head of the convention came to the stage and said , &quot; professor romer , thank you very much for your talk , but maybe we could look at the tedtalk .
i have it on my laptop . &quot;
so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk .
and i &apos;ve come to the core point that a new city gives people new possibilities .
there were the opportunity to live in a city that would be in hong care rather than hundreds of miles away from the north .
and a new city also includes new possibilities for executives .
the leaders of the government in honduras would depend on the help of partners countries , they could benefit from their partner countries that they put in the laws of the laws for this charter and through the production that everybody can trust that the charter is really going to be going through .
and the knowledge of president lobo , was that the certainty of the energy that i &apos;ve thought about was going to get a way to get the foreign investors and build this city as a way of building the city for all the parties for many years .
we are in an area .
this is a picture of this place .
it touch a thousand square kilometers .
and shortly after that , at the 19th of january , you &apos;ve voted in congress for a change of the constitution to have a prosecuting rule that is for special development .
in a country that has just a strong crisis , in fact , in congress for this change , there was 124 to a voice .
all the parties , all of the questions of society , supported this .
in order to become part of the constitution , it has to be approved twice through congress .
at the 17th , it was approved for the second time with 114 to a voice .
immediately after that election , between the 21st and the 24th , february , a delegation of about 30 ninans in the world , who were most interested in the two places that were most interested in the business of the city .
one place is southern korea .
this is a picture of a big , new city building that &apos;s built in southern korea -- big than the city .
everything you can see in this picture was built within four years after it took four years to get permission .
the other place that was very interested in the city was singapore .
there were two cities built in china , and the third is in preparation .
so if you just think about it , it &apos;s where we are today .
you already have a structure , and you &apos;re looking at this space for the second city .
it &apos;s been working on a legal system that encouragement allows to participate , and it &apos;s also working on an external legal system .
now , a country has already offered its top court to provide it as a court for the disposal of the crime system .
cities and designers are very interested .
they even bring funding with one .
one thing you already know has been done , there &apos;s a lot of miws .
there are lots of businesses who like to be in america , especially in a place with a free-trade zone , and there are many people who like to live there .
all around the world there are 700 million people who are saying that they want to live in a different place .
a million people a year leaving latin america and bicycles in the united states .
many of you are fathers who are forced to release their families , to suak , sometimes they &apos;re single mothers who have to make enough money to eat and clothing .
unfortunately , it &apos;s sometimes kids trying to find their parents that they , in some cases , haven &apos;t seen them since a decade ago .
so what is it for an idea to think about in hong levels as a whole new city ?
or are they even going to be able to get out of these cities , or have a hundred on the world ?
so what is it for an idea that is that every family has a choice between multiple cities that are in competition for new residents ?
this is an idea worth spreading .
my friends from honduras have asked me to say thank you ted .
you know how many choices you do in a typical day ?
you know how many choices you meet in a typical week ?
i &apos;ve recently done a survey with 2,000 americans , and the average number of decisions that are going to be a typical american person on a day is 70ting .
recently , a study was done with ceo in which they saw the ceo for a week .
and these scientists are just documenting the different topics of the people who are doing these ceos , and how much time do they have spent decisions with them .
and they found that an average ceo is done in the week with 139 tasks .
of course , each of these topics was made of many , many smaller decisions .
50 percent of their decisions were hit within nine minutes or less .
only about 12 percent of their choices needed an hour or more of their time .
think of your own choices .
do you know how many decisions you meet in the nine minutes in the category of each one hour ?
how good do you think they &apos;re dealing with that ?
today i want to talk about one of the largest decision-making problems of our modern time , the decision-making problems .
i want to talk about the problem , and some possible solutions .
now , if i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions , and i want to know your answers .
if i ask you a question , raise them , because i &apos;m blind , just if you want to burn some calories .
otherwise , i ask you , if i ask you a question , and your answer is , well , my first question for today is : are you ready to hear about the decision problem ?
thank you .
when i was a graduate student at stanford university , i went to this very very exclusive life store , at least he was really exclusive .
it was a store that was called draeger .
this business , it was almost like a pleasure replacement .
they had 250 different kinds of mustard and vand over 500 different kinds of vegetables and vegetables and more than two dozen different ways of water -- and that was a time when we actually got to drink water .
i loved to go to this business , but at a time i asked myself , well , how is it that you never buy anything ?
here &apos;s the olive oil .
they had over 75 different kinds of olive oil , including the ones that were locked in boxes , which were a thousand years old olive trees .
so i decided to go to the store one day , and i asked the ladder , &quot; does this model work that you really offer the people to all these possibilities ? &quot;
and he pointed to the bus charges of tourists who came and used their cameras every day .
we decided to do an experiment , and we chose marmelade for our experiment .
here &apos;s her marmelsin gang .
they had 348 different kinds of marmelade .
we &apos;ve set up a little bit of compliment right on the entrance .
we put in there six different tastes of divorce , or 24 different tastes , and we &apos;ve looked at two things : first , i mean , what &apos;s more people going to stay in and try marmelade ?
there are more people left when they were 24 , about 60 percent when they were six , about 40 percent .
and after that , we looked at the people who were more likely to buy a glass of mars .
now we saw the turning effect .
from the people who were staying when it was 24 , only three percent bought a glass of marmelade .
from the people who were stayed when it was six , now we saw that 30 percent were actually bought a glass of mars .
well , if you were to calculate it , people bought six times a glass of mars , who they had six to choice when they had 24 .
now , to decide not to buy a glass of marmelade is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our taille -- but it turns out that the decision-making problem is also affecting us very much .
we don &apos;t choose to decide even though it goes against our own best interests .
so for the day of the day , save save .
i &apos;m going to tell you a study that i was doing with gur huberman , ei kamenica , wei jang , in which we gave ourselves the decisions for retirement to the retirement of almost a million americans in the united states .
and what we looked at was whether the number of labels that had a pension plan could be possible , the 401 plan , the probability of whether to save more tomorrow .
and we found that there was a correlation in fact .
so in these plans , we had about 657 plans that gave people something between two to 59 different funds .
and what we found was that the more funds were offered that , in fact , the participation rate was lower .
if you look at the extreme , the plans , the two funds , had a sub-increase in the seventh -- still not as high as we want .
in the plans that almost 60 communicates , the sub-decline now fell on about the sixth percent .
now , it turns out that even if you were to take care of yourself , if you have more options , even then it has negative consequences .
so the people who decided to participate , rather than ever that the more possibilities they had available to them , the more they put them in terms of stocks and funds .
the more opportunities they have given them , the more they put their whole money in their hands of money .
none of these extreme decisions , belongs to the decisions that somebody would recommend when we care about the future financial well-being .
well , in the last 10 years , we &apos;ve seen three main negative consequences that offer that to offer more and more choices .
they push the decision -- push , even if it goes to their own best interest .
they &apos;re more honest decisions -- worse financial and worse medical decisions .
they &apos;re more likely to choose to make things feel less comfortable , even if they do objective better .
the main principle of this is that we may be enjoying these giant shelves of mayonaise full of mayonaise , mustard , vand marmelade , but we can &apos;t actually see the comparison , and then we can actually choose something out of fantastic supply .
so what i &apos;d like to suggest to you today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we &apos;ve tested in different ways in different ways -- you can just apply them to your business .
first of all , make .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never true than today , that less is more .
people are always worried when i say &quot; easy . &quot;
they &apos;re always worried that they &apos;re losing regalland .
but in fact , we &apos;re going to see more and more and more that if you &apos;re ready to reach , and the unimportant possibilities are going to be , well , there &apos;s a rise of increase , you &apos;ll have the cost of the cost , &amp; amp ; and there &apos;s an improvement of choice .
as a proctor and gamble , the different head of 26 to 15 , they experienced a rise of money to pay 10 percent .
as the golden cat corporation , her 10 at the worst sold katines , they found that the revenue for 87 percent went up -- a result of coming up with the rise of the increase and the reduced of cost .
you know , the average supermacrypt today offers 45,000 products .
a typical marketing network gives you 100,000 products today .
but the nine-largest supermarket , the largest largest supermarket in the world today is aldi , and they only give you 1,400 products -- a kind of tomato sauce in doses .
now in the world of savings , i think one of the best examples that came out of the market recently , about how to do the best choices , was something that david laadventison has been doing , and it &apos;s a program that is offered at harvard .
every single harvard employees takes automatically in a lifetime fund .
those who really want to make a choice will get 20 funds , not 300 , or more fund .
you know how people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to make it easy .
it &apos;s all important opportunities . &quot;
and the first thing i ask the employees question is , &quot; tell me how the options differ from each other .
and if your employees can &apos;t keep them apart , it can &apos;t be their customers . &quot;
now before we started sleeping today , i had a conversation with gary .
and gary said that he would be willing to offer all of the people in this audience , including an all-paid vacation in the world .
here &apos;s a description of the road .
and i want to read you .
and now i &apos;m going to give you a few seconds to read them and ask them to clap , if you &apos;re willing to take gary &apos;s supply .
okay . everyone who &apos;s ready is to take gary &apos;s supply .
are they all ?
well , let me show you a little bit more about this .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
well , who is ready for this journey .
i think i &apos;ve heard more hands .
good .
in fact , that &apos;s what they were looking at , the first time more information , when the second time , but i would make it a car to guess that they found it in the second time .
because the images made it real for them .
what brings me to the second technology is that it helps you deal with the problem of decision-making , it &apos;s the tangible .
it &apos;s about people to understand the difference between possibilities , to understand what consequences are associated with the individual possibilities , and that the consequences have to be vivid and tangible .
why are people spending over 15 to 30 percent more , if they use an ec-map or a credit card , as in barcash ?
because it doesn &apos;t really feel money .
and it turns out that if you make it a bit more specific , it feels a very good tool , so you can get people to save more .
so we went into a study that i did with shlomo benartzi and alessandro kidtero , we &apos;ve made a study with people -- employees , who have all worked for attention -- and those people were all in a gathering that they have their participation for their retirement savings plan .
and during that meeting , we &apos;ve got this gathering as much as they always was , we just added a little bit .
the small thing we added was that we asked people to think about the positive things that would happen in their lives if they save money .
we did this simple thing , there was a rise of participation at 20 percent , and there was one rise of the number of people who were willing to save or increase an increase by four percent in the amount that they were willing to pay for the savings accounts .
the third technique : categorzation .
we can deal with more categories than with more choices .
so here &apos;s for example , a study that we &apos;ve done in a time of time .
it turns out it &apos;s in the way of supermarkets , and down in the northeast area , the number between 331 different kinds of magazines until up to 664 magazines .
but you know what ?
if i show you 600 magazines and you put it in 10 categories , or i &apos;m going to show you 400 magazines , and that in 20 categories , you think that i have given you more choices and a better experience than i gave you the 400 .
because categories tell me how to keep them apart .
so here are two different types of crap .
it &apos;s called &quot; jazz &quot; and the other is called &quot; lone . &quot;
if you think that the left display is the contract , and the display on the right is , you clap into your hands .
okay , there &apos;s a couple .
if you think that on the left , jazz is , and the one on the right is a doodle , please clap .
okay , a few more .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
the one on the left is jazz and the right one on the right , but you know what ?
this is a high-speed unuseful resonance .
categories have to say something , not to tell the choice .
and this is a problem often when you look at the long bullet points of all these funds .
who do you want to get informed ?
my fourth technique : embrace complexity .
it turns out that in fact we can deal with more information than we think we need to simplify them .
we have to slowly increase complexity .
i &apos;ll show you an example of what i mean .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : the purchase of a car .
here &apos;s a german automaker that gives you the ability to control your car completely .
they have to make 62 different decisions to make their car completely .
now these decisions differ in the number of choices that make them decision .
autocolors , foreign color -- i have 56 possibilities .
motors -- four possibilities .
what i &apos;m doing now is i change the order in which decisions appear .
half the customers are going to be from the many possibilities , 56 autocolors to the low possibilities , four boats .
the other half of the customers are from the low possibilities , four boats , to the 56 autocolors , many possibilities .
what am i looking at ?
how are they interested .
if you &apos;re constantly using the standard choice in the decision , it means that you &apos;re going to be wormed , i get rid of it .
what you find out is that people who go from the many to the very many disvoting ponds always pick up the standard choices .
we lose them .
go from the little choices to the many , then you remain .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of options .
the only thing i &apos;ve done is to change the order of this information .
when i start with the simple start , i &apos;m learning how i choose .
even though , even though the motors choose to select me nothing about my preferences , it will still take me to choose .
it also raises me across the big product that i put together , and so i &apos;m willing to motivate myself to be involved .
let me summarize .
i &apos;ve told you about four techniques that overovertax the problem of decision-making -- just -- you get rid of the surplus alternatives -- make it real ; you can do it ; we can do better ; we can engage with more categories , less opportunities .
each of these techniques that i &apos;m going to describe to you today is to help you get the opportunities to manage -- good for you , you can use them for yourself , good for people you provide .
because i think the key to the best possible choice is you &apos;re in the selection .
and the more we choose to choose , the better we will be able to practice the art of choice .
thank you .
hi . i &apos;m kevin allocca , trends-manager of youtube . i &apos;m looking at youtube videos .
that &apos;s true .
today we want to talk about how videos are being channeled , and then that &apos;s why it &apos;s important at all .
we all want to be stars -- celebrities , singer , comedians -- when i was young , seemed so infinitely difficult .
but web videos have enabled us all or all of our creative activities to be incredibly famous in a part of the culture of our world .
every single one of you could be about the internet to the next saturday famous .
but on youtube , more than 48 hours of video is uploaded a minute .
it &apos;s just going to be a tiny percentage ever , and it will be thousands and thousands of times and so on .
so how does this work ?
three things : tastemaker , dividing communities and the unexpected .
well , then we want .
oh my god . oh my god .
oh my god !
woah !
pachyhhhh , wowwww !
last year , hypvasquez took this video that he filmed before his house in yosemite national park .
it was 23 million times in 2010 .
this chart shows how it was the video last summer for the first time .
it didn &apos;t really want a viral video to do .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
because you &apos;re doing that , if you &apos;re doing yosemite mountain hunter .
he had uploaded a lot of natural videos .
and this video was actually sent in january of january .
what &apos;s happened here ?
so jimmy kimmel came .
jimmy kimmel sened the tweet that made the video last so popular .
because tastemaker like jimmy kimmel put us new and interesting things and show them a big audience .
it &apos;s the friday friday , friday . gotta get on friday down on friday . it &apos;s a synthesizer distance to the doodle , missouri , friday , friday . friday , you don &apos;t think we would run this conversation without talking about this video , i hope .
rebecca blacks is one of the most popular videos of the year .
it was almost 200 million times this year .
that &apos;s what the chart looked like .
just like &quot; double rainbow &quot; it seems to be out of nowhere .
what happened this day ?
well , it was friday , that &apos;s right .
if you want to know , these other peaks are also free .
but what about this day , this particular friday ?
well , tosh.0 gabk , a lot of blogs started writing about it .
michael j. nelson of indiana science theater was one first one that made a joke about twitter .
it &apos;s important that one individual or a group of tastemaker took a point of view , with a big audience , and it accelerated the process .
and then this community formed of people who shared this big joke , and they started talking about it .
now there &apos;s 10,000 chilships from &quot; friday &quot; on youtube .
already in the first seven days , there was a childie for every single vodka .
unlike the 20th century entertainment , participation is our way to become part of this phenomenon -- either by spreading it or doing something new .
&quot; nyan cat &quot; is animation and the end loop .
that &apos;s it , very simple .
this year , it became almost 50 million times .
and if you think that &apos;s crazy , you should know that there &apos;s a three-hour version that was seen by four million times .
even the cats look at this video .
cats look at cats watching this video .
it &apos;s important , creativity , which is in the internet culture of techies and geeks .
there were remixes .
somebody did an old-fashioned version of it .
and then it became international .
a whole community community made out of the ground that made it a stupid joke to something that we can all participate on .
now we don &apos;t just find some pleasure on something we do .
who could have predicted this ?
who can predict &quot; double rain&quot; or rebecca black or &quot; nyan cat ? &quot;
what kind of books are you going to write in your writing ?
in a world where every minute of two days is uploaded to two days , it can only be really unique and unexpected as it mentioned .
i &apos;m not interested in it , i was not very interested in having a friend , i should look at this great video , about a guy who was protesting in new york for bicycles .
i got a ticket , because i didn &apos;t move on the bike path , but there &apos;s a lot of challenges that are not going to drive on the bike path .
since that was completely surprising and humorous , casey niestats became funny idea and his argument five million times .
this approach is true for everything we &apos;re creative .
and that all leads us to a big question .
what does that mean ?
whohhh .
what does that mean ?
tastemaker , creative community communities , are completely unexpected , are the characteristics of a new kind of media and culture , where everyone has access to the audience .
as i said , one of the biggest stars -- justin bieber -- made his beginning in youtube .
nobody has to give your ideas green .
and today we &apos;re all feeling as owners of our pop culture .
and these are not the characteristics of the old media and they hardly meet the media of today , but they will determine the conversation of the future .
thank you .
how can i talk about the interconnectedness between women about three generations , and how the amazing strength of this interconnectedness is reflected in a four-year girl &apos;s life , when she was in front of her little sister , her mother , and her grandmother &apos;s five days , and she &apos;s going to get out of chewing friends in a small boat , and she &apos;s going to be there today ?
the story is not over .
it &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s still being put in .
i want to share with you some of the puzzle pieces .
imagine the first piece : a man who burns his work .
he &apos;s a poet writer , a writer , a man whose entire life was held by the simple hope of unity and freedom of his home .
hold it on the march of the communist in saigon , as he has to stand , that his life had been a single waste .
the words , as long as his friends , spossed now .
he went back to silence .
he died , broke through the history .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i never met him personally .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
my grandmother never forgotten me his life .
i had to worry that it was not for free , and it was my job to learn that the history was not trying to break us , but we were over .
the next piece of puzzle shows how a boat in the early morning light is silent on sea .
my mother may have been 18 when her father died -- already in an arranged marriage , with two little girls .
for them , they had a job for their own family , the escape of their family and a new life in australia .
it was completely excluded that it could fail .
after a four-year and a film of film , there &apos;s a boat still on the lake as fishing boat .
all the adults were aware of the risks .
the biggest fear they had was pirates , rape and death .
like most adults on the boat , my mother was wearing a little toxic bottle .
in an undercover decline , i would have my sister and i , then you and my grandmother drink it .
my first memories are from this boat -- the egg of the engine , the clapping of each wave on the roof , the vast and empty horizon .
i don &apos;t remember the pirates , a lot of times , but let &apos;s get to the gay pad of the men on our boat , or in the case of the engine that didn &apos;t want to launch six hours .
but i remember the lights of the oil platform in the malaysia coast , and the young man , who broke together and died , the end of the journey was too much for him , and the taste of the first aprock that gave me one of the men on the platform .
no apple has ever cracked it again .
after three months in a refugee camp , we landed in melbourne .
and the next puzzle piece is about four women in three generations that are building a new life .
we set ourselves into football ray , which is one of the workcoites , where the population comes from imoccupation layers .
unlike in the old days in middle class , whose existence was completely unknown , there was no more sophisticated thinking in football ray .
the scaffolding came out of the rest of the world .
and the fat shoots became english in between people who had one thing in common : they started fresh .
my mother worked on farms , then on a treadmill in a car factory , six days , twice .
it kind of managed to find the time to get english and condomincations .
we were poor .
every dollar was divided and turned into more education for english and mathematics , no matter what we needed to do . most of them were the new things that came out of just second .
two few strands for school , each , to cover the holes in the other .
a school uniform until the knobs , because she had to reach six years .
and there were the rare ones that are painful , &quot; bad eye &quot; and there and there , &quot; asize , go home . &quot;
home where ?
something blew up in me .
there was a meeting to reconciliation and a calm voice said , &quot; i &apos;m going to go out of the way . &quot;
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
my mother was exhausted every night , but we told each other from our day , and we heard the movements of our grandmother &apos;s house .
my mother suffered in nightdreams from the boat .
and it was my job to stay awake every night until their nightdreams came , so i could get them up .
and she opened up a computer business , and then she opened a cosmechian , and she opened a business .
and the women came with their stories about men who didn &apos;t have the change , angry and unflexible , and sorsed kids , caught between two worlds .
loans and sponsors were tested .
centers were built .
i lived in parallel worlds .
in one way , i was the classic asian student , which was unlow demands itself .
in the other i was in uncertain life , which was the tragic scars of violence , the drug abuse and the isolation .
but that &apos;s how many people got over the years .
and because of this aid , i was in the last year of the jurastudy for the last year of the year as a boy .
and i became a piece of a puzzle for the next catapulted , and the edges didn &apos;t fit together .
tan le , anonymous liyer of football ray , was now tan le , refugee and social activist that was invited to speak of places they had never heard , and in houses that they never had imagined .
i was not familiar with the labels .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the bribe .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i wanted to go back to the routine and the comfort of life of an unknown day -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters who put out every one of their days as well as 20 years by telling each other about the stories of her day , and we &apos;re still sleeping in the same bed .
i said to my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
she reminded me that i was so old at the time , when we went to the boat .
no , no way .
&quot; just do it , &quot; she said . &quot; and not what you &apos;re not . &quot;
so i talked about jugenesis and education , and i was neglecting the marginalized and disrights .
and the more open i spoke , the more i should tell .
i met people in all the life , so many of them did what they loved , living on the limits of possible .
and although i graduated , i realized that i couldn &apos;t find myself with a career in jura .
there had to be another puzzle .
and i realized , at the same time , that it &apos;s okay to be a outsider , a newcomore , in the picture -- and not just okay , but something you need to be grateful for , maybe a gift of the boat .
because there can be so easily to collapse to collapse , so it can mean that you can embrace the assumptions of the environment .
i &apos;ve now gone out of my comfort to know that , yes , the world breaks apart , but not as you fear it .
possibilities that didn &apos;t have been allowed were exclusive .
there was a energy , an indominous optimism , a strange mixing of the humility and the sanent .
so i followed my gut feeling .
i collected a little team of people around me , which is not &quot; an unfair challenge . &quot;
one year we didn &apos;t have a cent .
at the end of a every day , i &apos;m a huge zoo of russia that we shared .
we worked late until night .
most of our ideas were crazy , but it was a few brilliant , and we created the breakthrough .
i met the decision to go to the u.s.
just one journey there .
my gut feeling again .
three months later , i was moved and the adventure continued .
before i leave the talk , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up at a time when confucianism was the social norm and the local kindergarten .
life hasn &apos;t changed since centuries .
her father died soon after her birth .
her mother blew her up alone .
with 17 , she became the second woman &apos;s second woman , whose mother she proposed .
without the support of your husband , she was having a sense of a problem by bringing it back in court and was in her own case , and a lot of a big deal , when she won .
&quot; don &apos;t be &quot; it &apos;s untrue .
i just sat in a hotel room in sydney , when she died . 1,000 miles away in melbourne .
i looked through the shoffes and looked at the other side .
i knew she had come to say .
my mother called me a few minutes after that .
a few days later , we went to a buddhist temple in football ray and sat around her sarg .
we told her stories and insurance that we were still at her .
to midnight , the monk came and said he had to close the sarg .
my mother asked us to grab her hand .
she asked the monk , &quot; why is your hand so warm and the rest of her is so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because she &apos;s been holding them tomorrow , &quot; he said .
&quot; you didn &apos;t leave them . &quot;
if there &apos;s a band in our family , it goes through the women .
you see who we were and how the life shaped us , we can now see that the men that might have come to our lives would have come to the low .
the defeat would have been too simple .
now i &apos;d like to have my own kids , and i still think about the boat .
who would ever be one ?
yeah , i &apos;m scared of privilege , before leigity , right ?
can i give you a bug in your life that supports the courageous wave of all the wave , the unspeaked of the engine , the long horizon , which doesn &apos;t guarantee anything ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give this , and i could make it clear , i would do it .
and the mother is there today in the fourth or five row .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
is it at all photography ?
because , of course , this is a picture that you can &apos;t pick up with your camera .
still my interest in photography , when i received my first digital camera , at 15 years old .
i combined it with my former record , but it was a little different , because using the camera was actually the process of planning .
and if you take a picture with a camera , it ends the process , if you squeeze on the trigger .
so for me , photography seemed to be about being at the right place at the right time .
i thought everyone could .
so i wanted to create something else , something that starts when the process is going to start .
photographs like this : a place along the road is a lot of road .
but it has an unexpected twist .
and yet , it &apos;s a realistic level .
or photographs like this -- dark and colorful , but all of them with the common goal , keeping a realistic plane .
when i say reality , i &apos;m making a photo-reality .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can really capture , but i want to make it look like you could have , on a photo .
photos , where you have to think a short moment to figure out the trick .
so it &apos;s more about capturing an idea than really a moment .
but what is the trick that makes it look realistic ?
is it about the details or the colors ?
is it about the light ?
what creates the illusion ?
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
but ultimately , it &apos;s about how we interpret the world , and how it can be made on a two-dimensional surface .
it &apos;s not about what &apos;s realistic , but what we think is realistic .
so i think the basics are very simple .
i see it as a puzzle of reality where you take different pieces and you can put together to create an alternative reality .
and let me show you a simple example .
we have three perfect imaginable physical objects that we can all identify with in a three-dimensional world .
but in a certain way , combined with each other , you can create something that looks still three-dimensional as if it could exist .
but at the same time , we know that it &apos;s not possible .
so we overlist our brains , because our brains are simply not deciding that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
and i see the same process in combine of photographs .
it &apos;s really just about combining different realities .
so things , the things that look realistic , i think are the things that we don &apos;t think about , the things that are around us in our lives .
but if we combine photographs , it &apos;s really important to think about it , because otherwise you just see it wrong .
so i would say that there are three simple rules to follow in order to achieve a realistic outcome .
as you can see , it &apos;s not three special images .
but you can combine something special like this .
so the first rule is that combined photos should have the same perspective .
secondly , combined photos should have the same lighting .
and these two images meet these two demands -- shot out of the same altitude and the same lighting .
third , it &apos;s about making it impossible to tell where the individual images start and end up by putting them seamlessly .
it makes it impossible to say how the photo was actually put together .
so by looking at color , contrast and helliveness on the edges of the individual images , they put fish together , like base depth , dedified colors and disorders , we digs the limits between the different images , even though a picture is basically hundreds of layers .
here &apos;s another example .
you might think that this is just a land image , and the bottom part was manipulated .
but this picture is actually completely put together , from photographs of different places .
i personally feel that it &apos;s easier to create a place than to find a place , because you don &apos;t have to have a compromise with the ideas in your head .
but it requires a lot of planning .
and when i had this idea in winter , i knew i needed several months to plan to find the different places for the pieces of the puzzle .
for example , the fish was taken on an incfield trip .
the bank is from a different place .
the underwater part comes from a rock .
and yes , i even put the house up on the island in red to make it look at sulfur .
so to get a realistic result , it &apos;s about me looking at planning .
i always start with a luxury , an idea .
it &apos;s about the combination of the different images .
and there &apos;s a very good job here .
and then if you do good images , it can be pretty beautiful , and also quite realistic .
so there are all the tools there , and the only thing that &apos;s happening is our imagination .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to talk to you about why so many electronic health projects failed .
and i think the most important point is that we stopped talking with our patients .
and one of the things that we introduced at the bidud university was to provide a major listener .
it &apos;s not particularly scientific -- she &apos;s a cup of coffee or tea , and he asks the patients , families , relatives , &quot; how does it go ?
how can we help you ? &quot;
and we think we want to think that this is one of the main problems , why everyone -- perhaps most of the electronic health projects failed , because we stopped listening .
this is my wlan-waa . a very simple thing .
she &apos;s got a button .
and every morning i jumps on it .
and yes , i have a job , you might recognize .
i put my job on 95 kilos .
it works very simply : every time i get to the age , they send my data to google health .
and there they go from my general doctor , so he can see where my weight is a problem , and it &apos;s not just the moment that i need kardian support or something , but also with a view in the past .
but there &apos;s something else .
maybe you &apos;re familiar with that , i have over 4,000 reuters who are on twitter .
so every morning i go to my wlan-waa and the people talking to me before i sit in the car , &quot; for lunch just a little tuke today , lucien . &quot;
but this is the bottom thing that can happen , because this is the group coerment , group pack , to help patients , because it could be used against obesity , or it could get patients smoking .
but it could also be used to get people out of their chairs , and to get them to play together any kind of game to control their health better .
next week , it comes to the market .
there &apos;s going to be this little blood pressure device that you put on an iphone or something like that .
and it will allow people to measure their blood pressure , send it to their doctor and share it for example , for more than 100 dollars .
at this point , the patients come to play . they can &apos;t just take control of control , the captain on their own ship , but also help us with the challenges of the challenges that we face before , and the cost of health care , twice , and so on .
make ways to use that easy and start to embrace patients in the team .
and they can achieve these kinds of techniques , but also by crowdsourcing .
and one of the things we did , i want to share with you through a short video .
we have all navigation systems in our cars .
maybe even in our mobile phones .
we know exactly where all of the money machines are around maastricht .
we know one more where all the gas stations are .
and clearly , we can find food chains .
but where would the next aed be to help this patient ?
we asked , and nobody knew it .
nobody knew where to find the next rescue of life in this moment .
so what did we do ? we did crowdsource in the netherlands .
we set up a website , and a human mass asked , &quot; if you see an aed , please share with us where he is , &quot; because sometimes he &apos;s open in business times , of course .
and over 10,000 have been raised in the netherlands .
the next step was to find the apps for this .
and we designed an iphone app .
we &apos;ve developed an app for layar , extended reality to find these aeds .
and if you &apos;re in a city like maastricht , and somebody breaks together , you can use your iphone , and within the next few weeks , your microphones , to save the next aed , can save life .
and today we don &apos;t want to just do this as anoble , like the product , but as well as anoble .
and we want to bring this to a global level .
and we ask our colleagues all over the world , from other universities , to help us behave like khik points to behave in the world .
and if you &apos;re on vacation and somebody breaks , it &apos;s your own family , or someone else , you can find that kind of aed .
the other thing that we want to ask is that companies are helping us all over the world in terms of these aeds .
these may be funny services , or technicians for example , just to make sure that the candidate is still in his place .
please help us and try to improve the health , but to take the hand .
thank you .
today i &apos;m going to report from unexpected discoveries .
i work in solar technology .
and my little startup wants us to force ourselves to make ...
... it crowdbits .
here &apos;s a short video about what we do .
oh . a moment .
it might take up until it &apos;s downloaded .
now -- we can just skip this -- i &apos;ll just skip the video .
no .
that &apos;s not ...
okay .
solar technology is ...
oh , my time is over ?
okay . thank you .
so a few years ago , i started a program to get the stars in technology and design to take a year , and work in a environment that &apos;s pretty much everything you hate , we &apos;ve been working in government .
the program is called &quot; code for america &quot; and it &apos;s a bit like the peacescorps for computer geeks .
we choose some fellows every year , and we &apos;re going to work with urban sprawl .
instead of sending them into the third world , we send them in rathawusers .
and there they developed great apps , working with urban employees .
but what they really do is to show what technology is possible today .
so they meet al .
al is a hydrant in the city boston .
here it looks like he &apos;s looking for a date , but what he really looks like , is someone who &apos;s free for him when he &apos;s in college , because he knows he &apos;s not very good at the branding when he &apos;s covered by a meter of snow .
how did he get to look for this particular kind of help ?
we had a team of fellows in boston last year , &quot; code for america &quot; program .
they were there in february , and it &apos;s got a lot of fun last february .
and they realized that the city never leaves those hydrant fires .
but a particular fellow , a man named erik mi els-ober , noticed something else , and that was that the residents went down the sidewalks , right before these parts .
so he did what everyone would do , he wrote an app .
it &apos;s a nice little app where you can adopt a hydrant .
you &apos;re praying to the window , if it &apos;s snowing .
if you do that , you can give it a name , and he called the first al .
if you don &apos;t do that , somebody can remove it .
so there &apos;s a nice little game dynamic .
this is a modest little app .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of the 21 apps written by fellows last year .
but it does something that doesn &apos;t do any other government technology .
they &apos;re expanding .
there &apos;s this guy in the i.t. department of hong honolulu , who has seen that he could use this app , not the snow , but , for the citizens of tsunami .
it &apos;s very important that these tsunami work , but people steal the batteries .
so he got the citizens to check them .
and then i decided seattle to use the app to get the citizens to get the clogged gullys .
and chicago just introduced it to get the people out of the window when it burst .
we now know nine cities that are planning to use this app .
and it has more friction , organic , of course .
if you know something about government technology , you know it doesn &apos;t normally work .
the funds of software takes a few years .
we had a team that worked on a project last year in boston , for three people took two and a half months .
it was about a way of figuring out the parents who are the right public schools for their children .
we told them later that if it was going over the normal channels , it took over two years , and it cost about two million dollars .
and that &apos;s nothing yet .
there &apos;s a project at the moment in the california juil that cost the taxpayer for two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this on any level of government .
so an app that &apos;s written in a few days , and then spread out of selar , is a kind of shot on the institution of the government .
it shows how the government might work better -- not more like a private company , how many people think they should .
and not even like an engineering company , but rather like the internet itself .
and that means free access , which means open and productive .
and that &apos;s important .
but more importantly , that app is that you represent a new generation of governance -- not as the problem of the government -- not as the problem of a collective institution , but as a problem of the collective operating .
and this is a very good news , because it turns out that we are very good at the collective act of digital technology .
now there &apos;s a big community of people making the tools that we need to put things together in common .
it &apos;s not just &quot; code for america &quot; fellows , there are hundreds of people all over the country who are writing and government apps , every day in their own communities .
they didn &apos;t give up the government .
they &apos;re terribly frustrated with her , but she doesn &apos;t complain about it , she &apos;s fixing her .
and these guys know what we &apos;ve lost from the eyes .
and that &apos;s when you forget all your feelings about politics and the snake office and all the other things that we &apos;re really excited about , is government , in the core , in the words of tim o &apos;s &quot; what we can do . &quot;
now , a lot of people have given the government .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , i ask you that you think about it , because things change .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is in change .
and because the government will take their power out of us -- remember , &quot; we do the people ? &quot; -- how do we think about it , will affect how this change happens .
i didn &apos;t know much about government when i started this program .
and as many people , i thought it was mainly about choosing people in office .
now after two years , i &apos;ve come to the conclusion that it &apos;s especially in community communities to come in .
this is the call center for service and information .
you usually get out of your town in your town .
if you &apos;ve ever had to have the chance to work in your urban call center , like our fellow scott silverman as part of the program -- in fact , do all of you -- you &apos;ll see that people who are calling government for many different problems including a lot of different problems including the fact that they &apos;re in their house .
scott gets this anmorf .
it &apos;s called &quot; marrat &quot; into the official database .
and he doesn &apos;t really have an idea . he starts with the animal catcher .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , can you just open up all the doors in your house and play very loud music and see if the livestock &apos;s skin ? &quot;
and that worked . for scott .
but that was not the end of the thylacine rats .
boston doesn &apos;t only have a call center .
it has an app , a web -- and hand app , called &quot; citizen connect . &quot;
we didn &apos;t write this app .
this is a work very smart people in the office of the new urban headquarters in boston .
one day -- this is a real report -- it came in , &quot; marolous in my trash can &apos;t say if she &apos;s dead .
how do i get it away ? &quot;
but what happens to citizen connect is different .
scott underholding himself from man to human beings .
but on &quot; citizen connect &quot; is all public , so everybody can see it .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
and the next post we got was , &quot; i went over there , the trash of the house was behind the house .
marrat ? yes . alive ? yap .
turned the trash on the side . went home .
good night , sweet marrat . &quot;
pretty simple .
that &apos;s great . this is the digital .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how the government is in the crowdsourcing .
but it &apos;s also a great example of the government as a platform .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition of the platform .
i &apos;m talking more about a platform for people to help themselves and help others .
a citizen helped another citizen , but the government played a central role here .
they turned these two people .
and you could be able to connect them with government performance if that needed , but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative to government services .
if a neighbor is helping the other one , we &apos;re powering our communities .
let &apos;s call the animal arms , it costs a lot of money .
one of the most important things is we need to think that government is not the same as politics .
and most people understand that , but they think that one is the input of the other .
that our contribution to the system is to choose .
how often have we chosen a political leader -- and sometimes we &apos;ve consumed a lot of energy to choose a new political leader -- and then we &apos;re focusing back and we expect the government to reflect our values , and then not changed much ?
this is because the government like a continuing ocean , and politics is the top 15inch .
and what &apos;s underneath is what we call bureaucracy .
and we use this word with such moments .
but it &apos;s this contempt that we have , which we have , and we pay for it to be something that works against us , something else , and then we made ourselves .
people seem to think politics is sexy .
if we want this institution to work for us , we have to make bureaucracy sexy .
because that &apos;s where the actual government is happening .
we need to look at the machine &apos;s machine .
so the contraos movement has done it .
did you see these guys ?
it &apos;s a group of concern who wrote a very detailed 325 page report , which is an answer on the sec memo for the financial reform .
it &apos;s not politically active , it &apos;s active .
now for those of us who have given the government , it &apos;s time we think about the world we want to leave our children .
you have to introduce the enormous challenges that you have to imagine .
do we really believe that we achieve what we need to achieve without improving an institution that can act in the names of us all ?
a government is absolutely necessary , but it has to become more efficient .
the good news is that technology makes it fundamental to reclaim the function of government in a way that can actually achieve something by raising society .
and there &apos;s a generation that grew up the internet , and that knows that it &apos;s not so hard to do things together , you have to build the only systems .
now the average age of our fellows is 28 , so i &apos;m , unfortunately , one generation older than most of you .
this is a generation that grew up to see their voice as granted .
they &apos;re not fighting that fight that we &apos;re all fighting , about who can speak ; they &apos;re all allowed to talk .
they can make their opinion , on every channel at every time , and they do .
so , if you &apos;re faced with the problem of government , you don &apos;t care about using your voices .
they use their hands .
they use their hands to write applications that improve government &apos;s work .
and these apps let us use our hands to improve our communities .
that could be a hydrant open window , unruwed to shoot , to turn a rister with a maroster .
and sure , we would have these hydrant fires all the time , and many people do .
but these apps are like little digital memories that we &apos;re not only consumers , and we &apos;re not only consumers of government who pay taxes and receive taxes .
we are more than that , we are citizens .
and we will not improve government until we improve the civil citizenship .
so the question i have for you here : if it &apos;s about the big important things that we have to do together , all together , we &apos;re going to be a lot of voices , or will we be a lot of hands ?
thank you .
usually , my role is to explain the people how wonderful the new technologies are , which are the ones that are coming up , and i thought to myself , i &apos;m going to tell you what i really think is going on .
i &apos;m going to start by showing you a single , boring slide .
so , you could just show the slide .
this is a slide i picked from my folder .
it &apos;s not about the details of the slide , but in fact , the general shape .
this slide shows data from a analysis of the performance of risky processors compared to the performance of a local area networks .
the interesting thing here is that this slide , as some others , which we often meet in our field , are a kind of a logarithmic curve .
in other words , every step here is equivalent to a power scale .
and this is a new fact that we need to use this guy scale on semi-logarithmic curves in the field of technology .
something very strange happened here .
this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
so , if you could do that light again .
something more carefully because i &apos;m going to draw something on paper here .
now , why do we draw in technology in a semi-logarithmic curves ?
the reason for this is , if i put it on a normal curve , where , let &apos;s say this is the years , so the timeline of a kind , and this is one of the things that i want to represent with a graph , the graph is silly .
that &apos;s what you see .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
now , if i want to record a different technology , let &apos;s say a transportation technology , then that would be very crude on the vertical logarithmic scale , in form of a flat line .
but if something like this is happening , it changes the circumstances .
so if the transportation technology continued as fast as the microprocessor technology continued , we could get overtomorrow into a taxi and in 30 seconds we would be in tokyo .
but it &apos;s not that fast .
this has never been in history before technology development , this kind of recursive growth , which is where the scale of order for all few years is exponentially rising exponentially .
the question i want to ask you is , if you look at this exponential curves , you &apos;re not going to go on forever .
it &apos;s not possible that everything is designed forever and forever .
there are two options .
either it &apos;s going to be a classic curve like this , up to something completely new , or it will happen .
it &apos;s about .
well , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think this is going to happen in the way that i &apos;m going to happen .
it &apos;s really like that , then we &apos;re in the middle of a transition .
we &apos;re here on this line , in a transition from the world to a new kind of world .
so the question i want to ask , and i often ask myself , is how this new world will be ?
what is this new state that the world is doing slowly ?
because the transition seems very , very confusing to being in the middle .
when i was a kid , there was the future in the year 2000 , and people were often talking about what would happen in 2000 .
now we have a conference where people talk about the future , and you realize that the future is still in 2000 .
that &apos;s not what we &apos;re going to do .
so in other words , the future is a year after a year since i &apos;m on this world .
i think the reason is that we realize that anything is happening .
the transition is happening . we can feel it all .
and we know that it just makes no sense of trying to look at 30 or 50 years into the future because everything is going to be so different that a simple source of what we &apos;re doing now doesn &apos;t make sense .
i want to talk about what that might be , this transition in which we are right now .
so to do this , i &apos;m going to talk about some other things that have really nothing to do with technology or computers .
because i think to really understand this , we have to take a step back and look at the thing on a longer scale .
and i want to look at this at the time scale of the earth .
i think the whole picture makes sense when you divide it into a few billion steps .
so let &apos;s go back , and it &apos;s 2.5 billion years . the earth was a big , sterile sweater with a lot of it .
now , if you look at the way these chemicals were organized , it gives us a pretty good picture of how they did it .
i also think there are theories that begin to understand how everything has started with rna , but i &apos;m going to tell you a simplified story of that , which is that , at this time , little oil drocks are swired around , which is different types of vaccine .
some of these seed drobs contain a special combination of chemicals that allow them to integrate other chemicals from the outside and grow .
they were all starting to share .
these little wells were the most primitive cell form .
however , these oil drobs weren &apos;t about alive today , because every single one of them was just a small , random recipe of chemicals .
and every time it divided up , it turns out to be very much distributed chemicals .
so every drip was a little different .
in fact , the drobs grew , which had a growth for growth , faster than others and integrated more and more chemicals from outside and shared .
so these accidents tend to survive longer and increase them in scale .
so this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but more interesting is going to be when these drocks learned a trick about abstraction .
in any way , which we don &apos;t really understand , these drip are learning the ability to write information .
they &apos;ve learned to store the recipe of the cell as information , and in a particular chemical form that we call dna .
in other words , they found in this intellectual , evolutionary kind of way that allowed them to write what they were doing , so that this information could be stored and copied .
the amazing thing about this is that this kind of information to store over the time of 2.5 billion years , where they were born .
in fact , the recipe for us , which is our genes from the exact same code and the same writing .
and every creature is using exactly the same letters and the same code .
we are , as far as we can , we can write ourselves in this code .
and i have 100 micrograms of a jelly that i &apos;m trying to keep in the airports of security .
in this , what i &apos;ve done is , what i &apos;ve done , i took this code -- the code is made of normal letters , which we use to the symbolic -- and i wrote my business map on a piece of dna , and i did it .
so if somebody wants a hundred million copies of my business card , i have enough for everyone in this room and even for everyone in this world , and it &apos;s right here .
if i was in fact , i &apos;ve been an anxious , then i would have written it on a virus and released in the room .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
the dna is an interesting step .
and the result of these cells -- that made it happy for another billion years .
but then another , very interesting step , where things were completely different , which is that these cells started to communicate and exchange information , so communities created cells .
i don &apos;t know if you knew that , but bacteria can actually exchange your dna .
this is the reason why it grows to antibiotics .
some bacteria have found how they can keep themselves from penicillin and have this information with other bacteria into dna and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate each other .
now , communication allowed the reasons of communities which were in a certain sense of the same boat ; they were synertically .
so they either survived together , or they went together . that meant that if a community was successful , all the individuals of the community have been repeated , and the evolution would prefer .
now , the transitions is where these communities are so close to the fact that they &apos;re determined to write the recipe for the whole community in a cartoon chain .
and the next interesting phase took about one another billion years .
at this point , we have multi-celled communities , communities of lots of shifts , which combined as individual organism .
in fact , we &apos;re also such a multi-celled community .
we have a lot of cells that are not on their own .
your skin cells are useless without heart cells , muscle cells , brain cells and so on .
so these communities began to evolve , so the level where evolution was happening , no longer the individual cell was , but the whole cell community that we call organism .
the next step now happened within these communities .
cell communities began to abstract information again .
and they developed special structures that made nothing different than information within the organism .
and these are the neural structures .
so the neurons are the information processing system that these cell communities have built .
they started to train specialists in the community , special structures , which were responsible for learning , understanding and information .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
this gave them an evolutionary advantage .
because at this point , an individual -- learning has happened within the time of a single organism in the lifetime of a single organism .
so , an organism could learn , for example , not to eat a particular frustrated , because they mucked and made it sick , the last time he eaten them .
now , this could happen within a single organism of a single organism , where hundreds of thousands of years ago had been used because this information had to be learned by the individuals that died because of these frustrated , because these information processing structures weren &apos;t there yet .
so the nervous process has the evolutionary process of this particular information landscape because the evolution could now be within an individual .
it could play within a time learning frame .
what happened after that is that the individual organisms found a way to communicate each other .
as an example , the most sophisticated version of this communication is the human language .
it &apos;s an amazing invention when you think about it .
i have a very complicated , unpleasant and confused idea in my head .
i &apos;m sitting here , and basically , basically , the key notes of me , in the hope of creating a similar idea in your head that has a certain sense with my original idea .
so we take something very complicated , turning it into sound , a sequence of sound , and produce something very complicated in the heads of others .
so this is what allows us to do a unified organism again .
and what we actually did , we , is we &apos;ve started to abstract .
we &apos;re going through the same stages , which have made more cell organisms -- the abstraction of our methods , how we hold data , we &apos;re presenting data .
for example , the invention of the language was a little step in this direction .
telephone labs , computers , video obama , cd-roms and so on , everything is our specialized mechanisms we built in our community to have this information .
and it connects us all together to something that is much bigger , and also able to develop faster than we &apos;ve been .
so today , evolution can happen at the time of microseconds .
you &apos;ve also seen tys little example of evolution where it showed a little bit of evolution in the convolania program , right front of your eyes .
so we &apos;ve regraded the timeline again .
the first steps of history , which i &apos;ve told you , is a billion years per piece .
the next steps , like the nervous system , and the brain , a few hundred million years .
and then slowly steps , like language and so on , have less than a million years .
and the next steps , like electronics , seem to be just a few decades .
the process is feeding itself from itself and becomes , i think , car catalytic is the word for it -- when something changes .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
and i think that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing here in this exploarly curve .
we see the process that &apos;s self-feeding .
i live a living building from computers , and i know i know that i can use the mechanism that i use to build computers , not using the recently advances in the computer technology .
my current method is to design objects with such a high complexity , that it &apos;s impossible for me to design this in traditional sense .
i don &apos;t know what any single transistor does in commitment machine .
it has billions of them .
what i do instead , and what the designers of thinking machines do is we think on a certain abstract level , that &apos;s the machine and the machine makes something that goes far beyond our capabilities , better and faster than we could ever do .
and it makes it partly with methods that we don &apos;t even understand right now .
a method , which is particularly interesting , and what i &apos;ve been using recently , is evolution itself .
we have an evolutionary process in the machine which is happening in the microwave space .
to give you an example , in the most extreme cases , we can create a program that &apos;s developed out of random instrutions .
we say , &quot; computers , generic request hundreds of millions of randomly chosen sequences of instrutions .
now i &apos;m going to take all of these randomly chosen instrutions , and they &apos;re all going to do all the programs , and they end up choosing the ones that i have on the next . &quot;
so in other words i first define what i want .
let &apos;s say i want to make numbers that would be a simple example that i used to use .
so find programs that can be placed at the best numbers .
of course , the chance of randomly elected instrutions is very small to make numbers of random numbers , so probably none of the instructions are actually going to do this .
but one of them may be lucky two numbers in the right order .
now i say , &quot; computers , take those 10 percent of the sequences that came up with the next one .
and we put these off , push the rest .
now , reproduced all the remaining ones that have the best sorted .
and with a method of remixing , analog to reproduction . &quot;
take two programs , and they produce kids through the exchange of their subroutines , and the kids , the traits of the subroutines of the two programs .
so , i &apos;ve got a new generation of programs that came through combinations of programs , which have made something closer to the suburbs than others .
say , &quot; please repeat this process . &quot;
put it back .
maybe there are some mutations .
and trying to do that again with another generation .
all these generations only need a few milliseconds .
and so i can run evolution over millions of years in the computer , or in more complex cases , some hours of time .
eventually i get programs that can go perfect .
in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i could ever write from hand .
if i look at these programs , i can &apos;t tell you how they work .
i tried to understand them .
it &apos;s verned and curious programs .
but they do the job .
i know , and i &apos;m sure they do the job , because they come from a series of tens of thousands of programs that do the job .
because her life depended on whether she did the job right .
i sat down in a 747 with marvin minsky , and he puts up a map and says , &quot; oh look . look at that .
there is , &quot; this airplane is made of tens of thousands of pieces , which work together to make their flight safer . &quot; don &apos;t make it reliable ? &quot;
we know that a developing process isn &apos;t optimal when it becomes too complicated .
so we &apos;re starting to rely on computers , for a process , which is very different from classical engineering .
he allows us to do things with a much higher complexity than the normal methods would allow us to produce .
and yet we don &apos;t understand the possibility of it yet .
so , in addition , technology covers us .
we use these programs to make the computers much faster so that we can make these processes even faster .
so it creates feedback .
it gets faster and faster and i think that &apos;s why it seems so confusing .
because all these new technologies today are feeding themselves .
we pick up .
we &apos;re at a point , which is the analog to the back of the day of cellular organisms .
so we &apos;re the amooans , and we can &apos;t quite make what the hell we &apos;re doing here actually .
we &apos;re in the middle of this way .
but i really believe that after we do something else .
i think it &apos;s very high to say that we are the end product of evolution .
and i think we all are part of the creation of what comes next .
now , lunch is before and i think i &apos;m going to stop right now before i &apos;m left .
my story starts right here in rajasthan about two years ago .
i was in the desert sky with sufi-singers in the desert with sufi mukhtiar ali .
we talked about it , nothing has changed since the ancient indian era , &quot; mahabharata . &quot;
if we wanted to travel indians at the time , we walked into a car and we put on the sky .
now we do this with airplanes .
at the time , when the great indian warrior chjuna saw the prince , he took a bow , landed in the floor and water .
now we &apos;re doing this with the drill and machines .
we came to the conclusion that magic and magic were replaced with machines .
that really made me sad .
i got some fear of technology .
it made me fear that i could lose the ability to enjoy the sun without camera and without tweet .
i found that technology should make magic and not kill .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little silver flashwatch .
this piece of 50 years old technology was the magical thing for me .
it became a very cute access to a world full of pirates and contaminated ships and to images in my imagination .
i felt like we had our fancy clocks and cameras to dream of it .
they kept us inspired by this .
and so i went to the world of technology to see how i could use it to make magic rather than killing .
with 16 , i began to illustrate books .
when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a storytelling for storytelling to connect the readers around the world .
it can know how we hold it .
it can know where we are .
it takes pictures and text together and animation , sounds and touch .
the storytelling always took more sense .
but what do we do about that ?
i &apos;m just going to khoya , an interactive ipad app .
here &apos;s &quot; put your fingers on every light . &quot;
and so -- this is , &quot; this box belongs ... &quot; i write my name .
and i get a character in the book .
and again , a letter to me falls down -- and the ipad knows from gps where i live -- that &apos;s right to me .
the child in me is really excited about this possibility .
i talked a lot about magic .
i don &apos;t mean a magician , and kites , but the magic of childhood , the ideas that we all had as children .
fireflies in a glass i found quite exciting .
so you have to download the ipad and make the fireflies out .
and the light is through the rest of the book .
another idea that was fascinated me as a child is that a whole galaxy can be in a single murmel .
and therefore , every book and the world is going to be a little murmel that i &apos;m eating to the magic device in the device .
and this opens up a map .
fantasy books always had cards , but these maps were static .
this map grows and is lighting up in the rest of the book .
it also turns out to be other places in the book .
i go in here .
it &apos;s important for me to create something that is essential , but it &apos;s also very time .
this is the apsaras .
we &apos;ve all heard of feeins and nympes , but how many people outside india know their indian colleagues , the apsaras ?
the poor apsaras were caught thousands of years in indras cambers in a very old book .
and we bring them back , in a contemporary history for children .
a story that comes apart with new issues like the environmental crisis .
the environmental crisis , a large issue of the last 10 years is that children in their rooms are sitting in their rooms , without walking out of their computers .
but now , with mobile technology , we can take our kids into the natural world with their technology .
in a interaction of the book , you &apos;re sent to a search . you have to go out and pick the camera of the ipads images of natural objects .
when i was a kid , i had collections of story , stones , viesles and shells .
somehow the children don &apos;t do it .
this ritual ritual is brought back . you have to go out to make a picture of a flower and mark it .
in another chapter , you have to have a piece of building mri and tag .
so you actually create a digital collection of photographs that you can put online .
a kid in london shows the picture of a fusion and says , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve seen a fusion . &quot;
a child in india says , &quot; i &apos;ve seen a monkey today . &quot;
this creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photographs that you actually recorded .
there &apos;s a variety of possibilities that are magic to connect the world and technology .
in the next book , we &apos;re planning a interaction in which you use the video of the ipads , and through augmented reality , you see an animation from the house in front of the house .
in a place , the screen gets filled with leaves .
you have to make the sound of the wind , you throw away and read the rest of the book .
we all move to a world where the natural history of technology comes closer and in magic and technology .
we use the energy of the sun .
we bring our kids closer and closer to the natural world , and the magic , fun and love of our childhood through the simple medium of a story .
thank you .
this is really an extraordinary honor for me .
i spend most of my time with people in research , prisons or death cells .
i spend most of my time with the most social weakest in social farming and places where there are a lot of hope .
to be here at ted , to see and hear how stimulating this is , i gave me a lot of force .
in the short time here , i realized that ted has an identity .
you can say things that have influence in the world .
and sometimes when something comes over ted , it gets a meaning and strength that otherwise wouldn &apos;t have it .
i say that because i think identity is very important .
we &apos;ve seen some fantastic presentations .
i think that we &apos;ve learned that the words of a teacher matter , but the words of a committed textbook are particularly meaningful .
as a doctor , you can do good . but as a doctor , you can do more .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
i didn &apos;t learn that in my work as a lawyer .
i learned this from my grandmother .
i became big in a family , a traditional african-american household who was dominated by a matriarch in dominated , and the matriarch was my grandmother .
she was a fan , strong woman , she had effect .
she had the last word in every family debate .
it was also the beginning of a lot of definitions in our family .
she was the daughter of a slave family .
her parents were born in the 1840s in virginia as a slave .
it was born in 1880 , and the experience of slavery formed their world &apos;s image very strong .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also loving .
when i met her as a little boy , she came to me and huiled me .
she made me realize that i could barely breathe . then she left me .
one or two hours later , when i met her , she came to me and said , &quot; bryan , you feel my hug ? &quot;
and if i said no , she said to me again . if i said yes , she left me .
it was something that was meant you wanted to be near her .
the only problem was they had 10 children .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
sometimes when i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to get her attention .
my cousins went around everywhere .
i remember , i must have been eight or nine that i woke up one morning and went to the living room . all my cousins were running around .
my grandmother was at the end of the room , and i kept staring at it .
first of all , i thought that was a game .
i looked at it and smiles , but she was very serious .
this was 15 or 20 minutes , and then she stood up and came to me . she took me at hand and said , &quot; come , bryan . you and i have to talk . &quot;
i remember if it was yesterday .
i &apos;ll never forget it .
she took me outside , and she said , &quot; bryan , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you have to promise that you don &apos;t have to say it . &quot;
i said , &quot; promised , grandma . &quot;
she said , &quot; choose word ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
she sat down and looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to know that i &apos;ve observed you . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do anything you want to do . &quot;
i &apos;ll never forget that .
then she said , &quot; you only have to promise me three things , bryan . &quot;
i said , &quot; ok , grandma . &quot;
she said , &quot; first of all , you &apos;re going to love your mom . &quot;
she said , &quot; mom &apos;s my baby , and you have to talk to promise that you &apos;ll always take care of them . &quot;
i mean my mother , so i said , &quot; yes , grandma , i &apos;m going to do that . &quot;
then she said , &quot; next to me , that you &apos;re always going to do the right thing . &quot; even though it &apos;s hard to do that . &quot;
i thought , &quot; yes , grandma . i promise . &quot;
and finally , she said , &quot; the last thing you have to promise is &quot; you &apos;re never going to drink alcohol . &quot;
well , i was nine years old , and i said , &quot; yeah , grandma . i promise . &quot;
i grew up on the land in the old , rural south and i have a brother who &apos;s older and a year young sister .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home and brought this sixpad beer with me , my sister and i went to the forest .
we were just running around like otherwise .
then he took a bite beer and offered my sister &apos;s sister , and she took me , and then she offered me one .
i said , &quot; no , no , no . all right . you just do . i don &apos;t want beer . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; well , do it . we &apos;re doing it , you &apos;re doing anything we do .
i had what , your sister had something . go , drink a beer .
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want . just do it . just do it . &quot;
my brother kept staring at me .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s going on with you ? well , it &apos;s painful . &quot;
and then he looked at me in the face , and he said , &quot; oh no , you don &apos;t always make you crazy because of the conversation . &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; grandma tells everybody that they &apos;re special . &quot;
i was devastated by the floor .
i &apos;m going to give you something .
i should not do that .
this is maybe going to translate public .
i &apos;m a 52 years old , and i &apos;m not allowed to drink a drop of alcohol .
i don &apos;t say that because i think it &apos;s a virtuous . i say that because identity does .
if we create the right kinds of identity , we can tell people about things that they &apos;re not beginning to believe .
we can get them to do things that they thought they couldn &apos;t .
of course , my grandmother would tell all her grandchildren , they &apos;re special .
my grandfather was during the prison shop in prison .
my uncle died of alcodust diseases .
and she believed that this was the themes that we have to take care of .
i tried to say something about our justice system .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
in 1972 , 300,000 people were in touch and prison in prison .
today , it &apos;s 2.3 million .
the united states today is the highest incarceration of the world .
seven million people are released , or with conditional crimes .
in my opinion , mass extinctions are fundamentally changing our world .
in socially uv and black parts of the population , despair and hopelessness , because of these changes .
one of three boys between 18 and 30 is in pure , in prison , in prison , or with conditional crimes .
in urban communities across the country -- from los angeles across philadelphia , in baltimore to washington -- are 50 to 60 percent of all the black young men either in prison , in prison , or with conditional crimes .
but our system is not only being formed by questions that have to do with rashcity , it &apos;s also going to be through poverty .
we have a ministry of justice in this country that you &apos;re treating much better if you &apos;re rich and guilty than and innocent .
wealth , it affects the outcome .
we seem to be satisfied with it .
a politics of fear and anger has convinced us that these problems are not our problems .
we lost the contact .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
there &apos;s a couple of interesting things .
so , my home state of alabama continues to give you the right choice , if you &apos;re sentenced .
and here in alabama and today in alabama , 34 percent of the male black people have lost their election right .
we predict that in 10 years , the rate of the citizen &apos;s recognition is going to be so high as it is before the introduction of voting .
silence is oeareté .
i present children .
many of my clients are very young .
the united states of america is the only country in the world , the three-and-a-half year-old children for death in prison .
in this country , there are children living for children living for their lives without a source of life .
we &apos;ve already run a lot of lawsuits .
the only country in the world .
i put people in death cells .
the death penalty issue is an interesting question .
we believe that because you &apos;ve taught us that the real question is : does a human being deserve to die for him ?
this is a very sensitive question .
but you can also think differently about how we see our identity .
the other way is not : does anybody deserve death for a crime , but do we deserve it to kill ?
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
the death penalty is defined by error .
in nine people that we &apos;ve executed , it comes from one that we found for innocent , which has been released and out of the death cell .
an amazing error rate . one of nine innocent .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
we would never let anyone fly on an airplane if for nine planes that pick up .
but somehow we &apos;re going to get away from this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden .
it &apos;s not our fight .
i &apos;m talking a lot about these questions .
i talk about race and the question whether we have the right to kill .
and it &apos;s exciting because i bring my students to african-american history . i talk about slavery .
i talk about terrorism , the time against the end of the world war , until the beginning of the second world war .
we don &apos;t really know very much about it .
but for the african-american americans in this country , it was a time of terror .
in many places , people had to have fear of lynchbury .
or bombs .
it was the fear of terror , which shaped their lives .
these older people now come to me and say , &quot; mr , stevenson , you &apos;re talking , you &apos;re talking . you tell people to stop saying that we should stop doing it for the first time in our nation with terrorism : after 9 / 11 . &quot;
they say , &quot; no , tell people that we grew up . &quot;
and after terrorism , of course , the rassters , and decades of rassistic , had increased and apartheid .
and yet there &apos;s a dynamics in our country -- we don &apos;t like talking about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our history .
and that &apos;s why we don &apos;t really understand what our actions have in the historic context .
we &apos;re constantly chasing together .
we always create new tensions and conflicts .
it &apos;s hard to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to go to the process of truth and reconciliation .
in south africa , people have figured out that the lawsuits aren &apos;t going to be the willingness to be honest and reconciliation .
even after the genocide in rwanda , there was this willingness , but not in this country .
i &apos;ve had some talks in germany about death death .
it was fascinating because one of the scientists stood up after my talk and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply daunting to hear them . &quot;
he said , &quot; in germany , there &apos;s no death penalty .
and of course , you can never give it in germany . &quot;
it was very quiet . then a woman said , &quot; with our story , it &apos;s impossible that we &apos;re ever going to kill ourselves for the systematic of people .
it would be more aware of us , consciously and determined people . &quot;
i thought about it .
what it would feel like to live in a world where german state introduced people to be in particular , especially if there were a lot of jews .
it would be intolerable .
it would be knowledge .
and yet , here in this country , in the states of the ancient south , we &apos;re doing people -- here &apos;s the risk to be convicted of death , 11 times higher when the victim is white , when it &apos;s black . 22 times higher when it &apos;s black .
and yet , there &apos;s this mental feedback .
i think our identity is threatened .
if we don &apos;t deal with that , with these hard issues , the positive ones are also affected .
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity .
we love entertainment .
but ultimately , these realities are unleashed by suffering , abuse , conflammation .
i think it &apos;s important to unite both .
because we ultimately talk about the fact that we need more hope , more engagement , more commitment , more commitment to a complex world .
for me , it means to get to think and talk about the poor , the disadvanced , who will never be at ted .
but think of a way that &apos;s embedded in our own lives .
we all have to believe things that we can &apos;t see .
we do that . so as rational as we are , we appreciate .
innovation , creativity , and development is not just from our heads .
they come from ideas that are driven by the belief in our hearts .
it &apos;s this headshell connection , which i think is powering us , not just being open to all the light and exciting things , but also for the dark and problematic .
now , vaclav hazz , the great cheinic politician , once said .
&quot; as we fought in eastern europe against oppression , we wanted to do all kinds of things , but what we needed most was hope , a mental adaptation , the willingness to be in hope , and to be witness . &quot;
this intellectual orientation is the core of what i think the ted communities have to get involved in .
there &apos;s no evidence of technology and design that allows us to be human and even human , as long as we don &apos;t have eyes and ears for poverty , out and injustice .
i want to warn you . this kind of identity requires a lot more of us than if we don &apos;t care about it .
it &apos;s going to touch it deeply .
as a young lawyer , i the great privilege to meet pink parks .
this is a woman , dr. king , coming back to montgomery , where she was taking two of her oldest friends to get these older women , john &apos;s carr , who had the montgomery-bus , who had a , whose husband , clifford durat .
so these women were just coming and underholding themselves .
and then it goes to my wife , and then he said , &quot; bryan , woman will come into the city . we want to talk .
would you like to come and listen ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yeah , really like . &quot;
she said , &quot; and what do you do when you &apos;re here ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;ll listen . &quot;
and i went over and i just heard .
it was always so inspirational .
and one day i sat there listening to this women , and after a few hours , woman parks turned to me to tell us , &quot; well , bryan , you say , &quot; well , what &apos;s wrong with the recess .
what do you try to reach ? &quot;
i started with my usual talk .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to go to injustice .
we want to help people who became innocent .
we want to fight prejudgment and discrimination in criminal justice system .
we want to create life due to the cause of life for children .
we want something against death companies .
we want to reduce the number of owners .
we want to create mass extinctions . &quot;
i gave my usual talk , and after that she looked at me and said , &quot; mhmm . mhmm . mhmm . &quot;
she said , &quot; it will make you very , very tired . &quot;
then mr carr said to me , put a finger on my face and said , &quot; and therefore you have to be very , very brave . &quot;
and so i think the ted community should be taer .
we need to have paths . we have to ask these challenges : these problems , this suffering .
because ultimately our humanity depends on our humanity .
in my work , i learned very simple things .
i learned a few very simple things .
that we are all more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
i think that &apos;s true of every man on the planet .
if somebody is lying , it &apos;s not just a liar .
if someone takes something that doesn &apos;t listen to him , it &apos;s not just a bribe .
even who kills somebody is not just a murderer .
and because that is , there &apos;s a fundamental human dignity that has to respect the law .
i also believe in many parts of this country , and certainly in many parts of the earth , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i don &apos;t think so .
i think in many places the opposite of poverty is justice .
and finally , i believe that , although it &apos;s so dramatic , so beautiful and inspiring , and so on , we don &apos;t actually be measured at the end of our technology , not about the things we &apos;re developing , not on our intellect and minds .
finally , a society will not be measured by how they treated their rich and powerful and privileged and privileged , but how they deal with the poor , the incarcerated .
because in this context , we start to understand the truly amazing things that make us .
sometimes i lose balance . a story to end .
sometimes i cut too much .
i &apos;m getting tired of how we all do .
sometimes these ideas predict our thinking in very important ways .
i gave these kids to be a very difficult master .
i go to the study prison and visit a client who may be 13 or 14 years old , and that &apos;s as an adult .
and then i wonder , how could this happen ?
how can a judge turn somebody into something that &apos;s not ?
the judge looked at him as adults , but i see a child .
one night i stayed up too long , and i thought , my god , if a judge can turn us into something else , it must have magic powers .
right , bryan , the judge has magic powers .
you should also have some wishes .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t really think of it anymore , i started working on an anedition .
i had a 14-year-old , poor black boys as a client .
and i started with this . the headline was , &quot; yield , my arms , 14-year-old black mandants like a privileged , white , 75year-old top manager . h5n1 &quot;
in my contribution , i explained that misbehavior of treasination and the police as well as policy should be wrong .
there was a crazy line about it that there &apos;s nothing more wrong in this country than there are still misbehavior .
the next morning , i woke up , and i didn &apos;t know if i was paying attention to this crazy grip or actually writing it .
and i didn &apos;t just write him , but i was sent to the court .
a few months went over and i had just forgotten everything .
but finally , i decided , my god , i have to say yes in the court and this crazy case .
i went into the car , and i was really overwhelmed with it .
so i went to the court .
and i thought that &apos;s so hard , so painful .
eventually i went from my car , and i went up the stairs to the court .
when i went up the stairs to the court , there was an elderly , black man , the janitors in the court .
when he saw me , he came to me over and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
he came to me and huiled me .
then he whispered me into the ear .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
and i have to say , there was power .
it touched something very deep in me , identity , the ability to contribute each individual , to a community , to a perspective of hope .
well , i went to court .
once the judge looked at me .
he said , &quot; mr. stevenson , have you got this crazy effect ? &quot;
i said , &quot; yeah . &quot; and then we started discussing .
more people came in , just because they were angry .
that i had written these crazy things .
police officers came in and deputed state workers .
in the craft , the court was full of people who were angry that we talked about skin color , about poverty , about inequality .
from my eye angle , i saw the janitors and down .
he always saw through the window and could hear the whole tohuwbeans .
he went and down .
and finally , this older black man came with a very smart face in the courca and sat right behind me , almost on the defense bank .
ten minutes later , the judge announced a break .
during the pause , a police officer came in , that the janitors were in the courca .
this deputy ran over the older black .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do in the court ? &quot;
the older black man stood up . he saw the deputy , then he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;m hercoming to say this young man , you don &apos;t lose the goal of the eyes , don &apos;t give . &quot;
i &apos;ve come to ted because i believe that many of you have understood that the moral penum of the universe is far out of the universe , but that the justice lasts .
that as humans , we &apos;re not completely developing , as long as we don &apos;t care about human rights and basic values .
that our entire survival of survival is connected to each individual .
that we need to connect our visions of technology and design , entertainment and creativity with humanity , compassion and justice .
and most of all , i want to share with you that as well , just say : don &apos;t lose the goal of the eyes . don &apos;t give up .
they have seen an obvious wish in this audience , and to help them and do something .
what else can we do ?
bryan stevenson : well , there &apos;s opportunities everywhere .
if you live in california , there &apos;s a national election in this spring where it &apos;s about to actually reframe a effort , something from the money stream , otherwise in the politics of punishment .
here , in california , for example , you become a billion dollars for the death death penalty . a billion dollars .
and yet , 46 percent of all puppors don &apos;t end with a negotiation .
56 percent of all rape cases are not in trial .
here &apos;s the opportunity to do something .
this reference is going to suggest to be investing in more security force and security .
i think there are opportunities everywhere .
during the last three decades , the crime rate is huge in america .
this is a fact that often put in a context with the elevated incarceration .
what would you say to somebody who believes that ?
now , in fact , the number of nonviolent crime doesn &apos;t change very much .
most of the masses of incarcerates in this country found not really in the class of nonviolent crime .
it was the misguided cross on drugs .
so the dramatic numbers come from the prison inmates .
we &apos;ve collapsed from the rhetoric of punishment .
now we have the three-eyed laws , the people who are behind bars forever , for a bicycle theft , for a flying good , rather than you force them to get the victims .
i think we need to do more to help people who have become victims of a race , not less .
and i think our current punishment is not helping anyone .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
bryan , you really have a string string here .
they &apos;re an inspirational personality .
thank you for being at ted . thank you .
bin laden takes death of an increased risk of risk .
two : famine , somalia , the police spray .
four : malignant cartels . five : dangerous tipping ships .
six : social decline . it &apos;s 65 .
eight : tsunami amiwarning : cyberattacks
different speakers : drug warfare . mass destruction .
recession . gridlock . doomsday . egypt . syria .
crisis . death . disaster .
oh my god .
so these are just some of the clips i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- but it could have been the last six days .
the fact is that the media prefer to show us negative issues because our minds are paying attention to these issues .
and there &apos;s also a good reason for that .
every second every second , our senses will begin much more information than our brain can ever process .
and because nothing is more important than our survival , the first stop for all the information is part of our temporal lobe , the amygdala .
so the amygdala is our breakfast warning system , our risk detector .
it denitates and mutting the whole information on the search for any assumption of danger in our environment .
so if we see the news , we prefer to look for negative news .
and the old adage , &quot; if it &apos;s bleeding , is going to be very true . &quot;
now , with all of our digital devices that seven days the week , 24 hours a day on all these negative news is not a miracle that we are pessimistic .
it &apos;s not a miracle that everybody thinks it &apos;s always going to be worse .
but maybe this is not the case .
maybe that &apos;s the reality .
maybe the tremendous progress that we have in the last century is made by a series of forces , so strong that it will be possible to create a world of overcoming .
well , i &apos;m not saying that we don &apos;t have a big problem -- climate crisis , species dying , water and energy problems -- we have .
and as humans , we are much better at looking at problems in a very long way , but ultimately it &apos;s coming to overcome .
let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve done in the last century , so we can see the evolution .
in the last hundred years , the average life expectancy has more than doubled to inflation , which has been tripled to inflation .
child mortality has a tenth of a fold .
and that means that food , electricity -- transportation and communication costs have been reduced to a multilevel .
steve pinker showed us that we currently live in a very peaceful era of human history .
and charles kenny , in the past 130 years , is up by 25 percent in the last 130 years .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and many people forget this .
and we increase our expectations continuously .
in fact , we redefined poverty .
think that a large percentage of americans who live below the poverty line , access to electricity , water , toilets , refrigerators , television phones , the mobile phones and cars .
the richest capitalists of the last century , the predictators of the earth , would never be able to dream like these luxury goods .
the basis for a lot of these are technologies and these grow expotentially .
my great friend ray kurzweil showed us that every tool that &apos;s going to do information technology on the curve of moore &apos;s law is great , and the price performance is doubling every 12 to 24 months .
that &apos;s why the mobile phone costs about a million times less , and it &apos;s a thousand times faster than a supercomputer from the &apos; 70s .
now look at this curve .
this is moore &apos;s law for the last hundred years .
notice two things on this curve .
first , how smooth it goes -- in good times in bad times , war or peace , recession , depression and high-speed juncture .
this is the result of faster computers , which build faster computers .
it &apos;s slowed down for not our big problems .
also , despite their logarithmic relies on the left , it goes upwards .
so the growth rate itself is accelerating .
and on this curve , the back of moore &apos;s law , we find a series of extraordinary technologies that are all available .
&quot; cloud computing , &quot; something that my friends on autodesk are called &quot; calculus activating computing , &quot; sensors and networks , robots , circuits that allow them to democratize the personal production of our planet , synthetic biology , structural materials and artificial intelligence .
how many of you have seen the victory of ibm superwatson in &quot; risks ? &quot;
that was the granca .
i went through the newspapers , and after the best headlines i could find .
i love this : &quot; watson force human enemies . &quot;
&quot; risk &quot; is not a simple game .
it &apos;s about understanding the patterns of the language .
imagine that these artificial intelligence provided each owner of a mobile phone .
four years ago , ray kurzweil , i launched a new university here at ted called singularity university .
we bring our students all together , with special focus on how they can be used to solve the great challenges of humanity .
and every year we ask the students to create businesses , products and services that can live in a decade of billions of people .
think about that , a group of students today can influence the lives of billions of people .
30 years ago , this would have been ridiculous .
today , we can put in dozens of companies that have done exactly this .
when i think about creating abundance , i don &apos;t mean a life full of luxury for everyone on this planet ; it &apos;s about creating a life full of possibilities .
it &apos;s about making scarce assets from scarce goods .
so scarcity is contexsion , and technology is liberating power .
here &apos;s an example .
this is the story of napoleon iii. in the middle of the 18th century .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
he invited the king of siam to dinner .
napoleon soldiers got silver bribe , napoleon himself got gold-bribe .
the king of siam though got aluminum bribe .
aluminum around this time was the most valuable metal on the planet , valuable than gold and platin .
this is the reason the dome of the husington cad was made of aluminum .
even though aluminum to take 8.3 percent of the mass , it &apos;s not as pure metal .
it &apos;s associated with oxygen and mauritius .
but then the technology of electrolyse was developed and made aluminum manufacturing so cheap that we use it with our current mentality .
then let &apos;s put that analogy into the future .
we think of energy scarcity today .
ladies and gentlemen , we live on a planet of 5.,000-times more energy than we consume every year .
16 terawatts energy , all the seasons on earth &apos;s surface .
it &apos;s not about scarcity , the problem is accessible .
and there &apos;s good news .
this year , for the first time , we &apos;ve done it to reduce the cost of solar power in india to 50 percent of the pedal power -- 8,8 rupees compared compared to 17 rupees .
the cost of solar energy was 50 percent last year .
last month , this has published with a study that shows that by the end of this decade in the united states of the united states , solar is going to cost about 50 cents per gallon , compared to 15 cents in the national average .
and if we have an energy overset , we &apos;ll also have water in the abundance .
let &apos;s talk about water wars .
do you remember when carl sagan was in 1990 , when it moved by saturn in saturn , back to the earth ?
he took a famous photograph . how did it mean ?
&quot; a lone blue dot . &quot;
because we live on a water planet .
we live on a planet that &apos;s covered 70 percent with water .
yes , it &apos;s 97.5 percent saltwater 2 percent , two percent , and we fight about 0.5 percent of the water on the planet , but there &apos;s also hope .
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
it &apos;s new variability on the way , nano-materials .
and from a conversation this morning with dean k. , one of the innovators of doing it , i want to share with you -- he gave me the permission -- his technolgy , which is called &quot; slingshot , &quot; and some of you may have heard about it . it &apos;s the size of a refrigerator .
it can produce a thousand gallons of clean drinking water per day -- whether water water , polluted water , latrine -- and all that for less than two cents per gallon .
the president of coca-cola has just ordered , a big deal project with a hundred units in developing countries .
and if everything goes well , and i &apos;m very confident , then coca-cola will apply this technology in 206 countries around the planet .
this is the technique of technology that we have today .
and we &apos;ve also seen this in mobile phones .
oh my god , we &apos;ll soon reach the 70 percent rate of mobile phones in developing countries to the end of 2013 .
just think that a mai warrior with a cell phone in the middle of kenya has a better mobile communication than president reagan 25 years ago .
and if you look for your smartphone on google , you have more access to knowledge and information as president clinton 15 years ago .
they live in a world that has information and communication in the abundance , how no one could ever predict .
and it &apos;s even better , the things that you &apos;ve spent , and i &apos;ve spent a thousand dollars -- gps , hd video and photograph , libraries of books and music , technology to the medical diagnosis -- now , literally materialized and cheaper in your mobile phone .
and the best thing is perhaps what &apos;s expected in health .
last month i had the pleasure with the quality foundation that &apos;s called &quot; $ 10 million plcomm tricordes . &quot;
we &apos;re asking teams around the world to connect all these technologies into a cell phone , that you can talk to the device , because it &apos;s with artificial equipped , you can test in your blood and test your blood values .
and to win , the device has to make a better diagnosis than a team high-trained physicians .
imagine this device . in the middle of a developing country , where there is no doctors , but 25 percent of the burden of disease and 1.3 percent of the staff of healthcare .
if this device sequenced a pure virus or dna virus that &apos;s not known , it calls health care and prevent a pandemic in front of you .
but now the biggest force that leads us to a world of overflow .
i call them &quot; the coming billion . &quot;
the white lines are for population .
we &apos;ve just crossed the seven-billion-second brand .
and by the way , the largest displacement against a population of diffusion is a better education and nutrition in the world .
in 2010 , we had just connected to two billion people online .
by 2020 , we &apos;ll predict about two billion on five billion internet users .
three billion new minds , which we &apos;ve never heard before , will connect the global communication .
what do these people need ?
what are you going to consume ? what are you going to want ?
and instead of economy , i see one of the largest economic assets of history .
these people represent multiple dollars that will flow into the global economy .
and they &apos;re going to be healthier by using the value of the tricoman , and they &apos;re going to be trained by the khan academy , and by doing that , they &apos;re going to use 3d printers and &quot; philanthroentation computing , &quot; and so much more productive than ever before .
so what can three billion growing , healthy , educated , productive members of the human community us ?
how about a sentence of new , never before ever before .
how would it be , the oppressed , wherever they are , to give voice to a voice to make sure and create change , for the very first time ?
what are these three billion people going to bring ?
how would it be that we can &apos;t even predict ?
one of the things i learned through the x prize is that small teams , who are motivated by passion and focus , can create extraordinary things , things that could only create large companies and governments in the past .
i want to conclude with a story that really excites me .
there &apos;s a program that some might already know .
it &apos;s a game called foldit .
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
and it &apos;s a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids to study how the protein is going to evolve .
according to his behavior , we can predict the structure and function .
and this is very important in medical research .
so far , this was a problem for superman .
and this game was played by university and so on .
and there are hundreds of thousands of people who played the game online .
and it showed that these days , the human pattern recognition is better than the best supercomputer .
and when these people came and looked at who &apos;s the best piece of the world , it wasn &apos;t a mit professor , not a caltech student , it was somebody from england , manchester , a woman who was working in the dayrun of the world &apos;s clinic at night .
ladies and gentlemen , what gives me enormous trust in our future is the fact that we have more power than individuals to put us in the big challenges of our planet .
we have access to tools with exponential technology .
we have the passion of a diy innovators .
we have the capital of techno-impaired .
and we have three billion new minds that we can work with online , to master new challenges , and to do what needs .
we expect some extraordinary decades .
thank you .
i think we need to do something about a transformational piece of medical culture .
and i think it begins with a medical medical doctor .
and maybe i have a long enough time in business than i can allow me to give it a piece of my own mislasting .
but before i get to the theme of my talk , let &apos;s start with a little bit of baseball .
hey , why not ?
we are the seasonal and we move to the world championship .
we all love baseball , right ?
baseball is full of great statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
&quot; moneyball &quot; appears soon and turns around statistics and to use this a great baseball team .
i &apos;m going to get to a statistics that i hope most of you have heard of .
it &apos;s the average performance of the bat .
we talk about a 300 if a bat is 300 .
that means that the player will match three of them .
this is what the ball does in the field , it &apos;s coming , it &apos;s not caught , and who &apos;s trying to throw the ball to the first base , it didn &apos;t have done it in time and the speaker was safe .
three in 10 .
you know how to call a 32,000 in great samaritbaseball ?
well , really good , maybe a major star .
you know how to call a 42,000 ?
this is one of the people in the rest of the 10 .
legendary -- like ted williams legendary , the last major samaritbaseball player of a regular season , over 400 times .
so let &apos;s go back to the world of medicine in my world , which i feel about a lot , or maybe a little bit less likely after i &apos;ve talked to you about it .
imagine if you have a blind arm , and you &apos;re going to be an african-american overclaiming , which is the average performance of 400 in terms of blind .
it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
suppose they live in a certain remote area , and they have a beloved people with clogged heart disease and their housedoctor overimposed that to a cardiologist whose average performance is about 200 .
but , you know what ?
it &apos;s much better this year . it &apos;s on the rise .
and they beat a 257 .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
what do you think the average performance for a cardiologist or a nurse or a orthopedic , an orthopine , should be a servant ?
1,000 , very good .
the truth is that no one in the entire medicine knows what a good surgeon or doctor should be .
but what we do , however , is that every one of you , including me , is in the world to be perfect .
never make a mistake , but no one &apos;s doing the details of how it should be done .
and that &apos;s the message i took in medical school .
i was a brilliant revelation student .
in high school , a student said that brian goldmann would learn for a blood test .
and so it was .
and i learned in my little roof in the nurses at the toronto general hospital , unfar from here .
i learned everything .
in my anatomy-class , i learned the origins , and the tail every branch , every branch of every artery , which runs away from the aorta , obskers and ordinary differential diagnostic .
i even knew the differential diagnosis for renale tubuv afer .
and the whole time i collected more and more knowledge .
and i was good , i closed with cde laude .
and i left the medical school with the impression that i knew if i knew everything and everything , or at least as much as possible , as close as possible as possible , that i was immun against mistakes .
and it worked for a time until i met my wife .
i &apos;m resistant to a teaching hospital here in toronto as a woman to me in the emergency department of the hospital .
at that point , i was the karthiological layer in the kardiology service .
and it was my mission when the emergency staff were looking at cardiological advice to study the emergency patient .
and there &apos;s feedback to my top doctor .
i studied the printer , and she was in respiratory distress .
and when i listened to her , she made dares sounds .
and when i heard her chest with the stethoscopes , i could hear a broken sound of the sound on both sides that said to me that she was suffering by congesting heart failure .
this is a state in which the heart was failing , rather than pump the entire blood farther , a part of the blood is stuck in the lung , and then it came up with the short term .
and that was not a hard diagnosis .
i hired them and made me care of the treatment .
i gave her a documentary . i gave her medicine to take the pressure from the heart .
i gave her medicine that we call diuretics , water pill , so that she pulled out the liquid .
and over a period of time to two hours , she started feeling better .
i felt really good .
and i made my first mistake ; i sent them home .
actually , i made two mistakes .
i sent them home to speak without my head .
i didn &apos;t take them up and i did what i should have been , which would have been a call in my upper doctor to reveal it so that he had a chance to make a picture .
and he knew them , he would have been able to drive extra information to her .
maybe i did it with good reason .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be a healthy doctor .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so capable of taking responsibility that i was able to be able to do without having to contact it for my patients .
my second mistake was worse .
and that &apos;s what i sent them home , i missed a silent voice in me trying to say , &quot; goldman , no good idea . don &apos;t do that . &quot;
in fact , it seemed to me so much of self-security that i asked the nurse who was taking care of , &quot; do you believe it &apos;s okay if you go home ? &quot;
and the nurse thought about it , and he said , &quot; well , i think it will go well . &quot;
i remember it was yesterday .
so i signed up the papers , and a hospital and rescue and rescue came and brought them home .
and i went back to work .
the rest of the day , i got this nagging feeling in my stomach .
but i continued to work .
and at the end of the day i grabbed my things , leaving the hospital , and went to the parking room to drive home with the car when i did something else i didn &apos;t do .
i went through the emergency department of my way home .
and there was another nurse , not the sister who had seen the photo after woman , but another three words to me and that three words fear most of the most emergency doctors i know .
other doctors fear this as well , but the emergency medicine is particularly , because we &apos;re just seeing the patients like that .
the three words , you remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patients you signed home ? &quot;
the nurse was asking .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in this particular spot .
so she was back .
she was back and dying .
about an hour after that she reached home after i sent her home , she collapsed , and the family called 911 . the rescue assistant they brought back to the emergency station with 50 , which is dangerous .
she wasn &apos;t breathing , and she was blue .
the emergency staff were all strands .
they gave her blood pressure .
they put them on the oven machine .
i was shocked by the inside .
and i was living through these rollers because they moved to the productivity station , and i hoped they would recover .
and after two , three days , they realized that they would never be bitten again .
she didn &apos;t have the brain damage .
their family gathered .
and over the course of the next eight or nine days , they gave themselves a shot .
on the new day of liese they go -- woman printer , a woman , a mother and grandmother .
you say you &apos;re the names of the people who never forget the names .
and that was the first time i learned this myself .
the next couple of weeks i told myself , and i learned to be the first time shame , which exists in our medical culture -- i felt myself alone , isolated , not the kind of healthy shame that you can feel because you couldn &apos;t talk to the colleagues about it .
you all know the healthy shame , if you give a secret of the best friend &apos;s prize , even though this one on a disclaimment and you get caught , and you get the best friend to deal with it , and i &apos;m going to get a terrible discussion , if you &apos;re at the end of the bad situation , and you &apos;re going to get a bad discussion .
if you do it again , and you never do the mistake again .
this is the kind of educational shame .
the inhealthy way i &apos;m talking about is the one in the first sick way .
it &apos;s the one who tells you that it &apos;s not what you &apos;ve done , but you &apos;re bad .
and that was what i felt .
and it wasn &apos;t the reason for my doctor , he was very dear .
he spoke with the family , and i &apos;m sure he made the glass glass and sure that i wasn &apos;t going to cut .
but i kept asking these questions .
why didn &apos;t i ask the doctor ? why did i decline her home ?
and then in my worst moments , how could i make such a stupid mistake ?
why did i go to medicine ?
but slowly , it was safe .
i started feeling better .
and then on a day of mine , there was a hole in the clouds , and the sun broke out , and i may be able to feel better again .
and i was talking to myself that if i doubled my efforts to the perfection , never again a mistake that the voice could swallow .
and she did .
and i continued to work .
and then it happened again .
two years later , i had service in the emergency hospital in a communist hospital north of toronto and i hired a 25 year-old man with married raws .
it was much less , and i was in a hurry .
he always showed up here .
i looked in the front and it was a little pink .
and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him on .
and when he went out of the door , he showed up his rails .
two days later , i came to my next emergency service , and my checolortin asked me to talk to her office .
and she said the three words : do you remember ?
&quot; you remember the patient with the bathed railed ? &quot;
it turns out he was an infection .
he had a potentially life-saving disease called epibald .
you can google the google , but it &apos;s not infection of the wheel , but the top kind of breathing way and causes the respiratory pathways .
and fortunately , he didn &apos;t die .
he got intraventer anti-bovo and brought a few days later .
and i went through the same torsack of shame and self-doubt , and i felt liberated and went back to work until it came back and again .
in an emergency layer , i &apos;ve seen two times a blind arm .
there &apos;s a lot of things about that , especially when you think that you &apos;re working in a hospital that only had 14 patients per night .
in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home , and there was probably no money in their treatment .
i thought i had kidney stones .
i summarize the x-ray of the kidses , and when that wasn &apos;t a case , my colleague introduced to the revision of the patient in the lower right sector , and called the operates .
the other one had strong diarrhea .
i assure him to recroak it and ask my colleagues to do it too .
and that &apos;s what he did , and he was putting a negotiation in the right lower area , called the operates .
in both cases , operied and it went well .
both cases for me , ask me .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst mistake happened only in the first five years , which is what many of my colleagues claim , but total nonsense .
some of my favorites happened in the last five years .
alone , shame and no support .
here &apos;s the problem : if i don &apos;t end up with my mistakes and talk about them , if i can have the silent voice that tells me what &apos;s really happening , how can i share it with my colleagues ?
how can i teach them my mistakes so that they don &apos;t commit the same ?
if i put in a room -- like now , i don &apos;t know what you think about me .
when did you hear the last time from someone &apos;s failures talking about misbreaks ?
oh yes , you go to a cocktail party and you like to hear about any other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody talking about your own mistakes .
if i was in a room full of colleagues and to ask them their immediate support , and to tell them what i just told you , i would probably not achieve the end of the second story before they really get awkward , you would have a joke , and forget about the rest .
and in fact , if i knew or my colleagues that an orthopedic in my hospital would have taken the wrong leg off , believe me to look at the problems .
that &apos;s the system we live in .
it &apos;s a totally denial of mistakes .
it &apos;s a system where there are two basic positions -- the ones that make mistakes and those who don &apos;t do . those who don &apos;t do it , the lack of disrestrictions and the results with good results .
it &apos;s almost an ideological response like antibodies that attack people .
and there is the idea that when we put those people who are making mistakes out of medicine , we have a safety system .
but there are two problems .
in my about 20 years of medical consciousness and journalism , i &apos;ve created a personal medical study about medical errors and wrong treatments to make all kinds of things i have for the toronto star to my show , &quot; white philanthro, black , black . &quot;
and what i learned is that errors are absolutely impossible .
we &apos;re working in a system where every day we have mistakes in the process where one of 10 medics is either wrong or wrong , in the hospital infections , and they become more and more mature or dead .
in this state , about 24,000 canadians die of uninhabited mistakes .
in the united states , the institute of medicine represents the number of 100,000 .
they &apos;re both strong underfishing because we don &apos;t look at the problem as we should .
and it &apos;s the crux .
in a hospital system in the medical system , all two to three years , we can &apos;t keep doubling .
sleep is ubiquitous .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we have a cognitive error , so we can take a perfect disease course for a patient with breast pain .
and then i take the same patient with chest pain , and i &apos;m going to break it and give it a little bit of alcohol , and give it a little bit of alcohol , and all of a sudden , the story passes with contempt .
i don &apos;t take the same course .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things .
and my patients are not cars ; they don &apos;t always tell me their symptoms in the same way .
all of that is inevitable .
so if you take the system , as i &apos;ve been taught , and all of the faults of health care care is in the end of no matter .
and you know the wages of people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
in my show , &quot; white airlines , black art , &quot; i have the habit to say , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; i would say to everybody from rescue to the chefare of cardiologists , &quot; that &apos;s my worst mistake , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah . &quot;
and then their puils expand , they get out of the head , they look down , and they &apos;re hard to look down , and they start to tell their stories .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
they want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistakes that i developed . &quot;
what you need is a environment that you &apos;re able to do .
what you need is a new medical culture .
and it starts with a doctor .
the new redefined doctor is a human , white to the human , accepted , is not proud of making mistakes , but it &apos;s all about learning that it can be passed on .
they share their experiences with others .
they support when others talk about their mistakes .
and it shows other people their mistakes , not to make the naked , but in a loving , supportive way that all of them benefit .
and she works in a medical culture that recognizes that people fill the system with life and when that &apos;s so , then people do mistakes from time to time .
so that the system has evolved to create backups , which make it easier to find mistakes that are inevitable to people who do it and enable it to create a lot of mental spaces where anyone who &apos;s watching health care can actually be addressed , and that &apos;s actually going to be rewarding , and in fact , for people like me , who should be compassionate .
my name is brian goldman .
i &apos;m the redefining doctor .
i &apos;m a human . i make mistakes .
i &apos;m going to sit away . but i &apos;m trying to learn to learn from it .
i don &apos;t know what they hold from me , but i can live .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
it &apos;s transformative transportation .
and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i &apos;ll tell you three stories before the time .
the first story is charles darwin , one of my heroes .
you know , he was in 1835 here .
you might think he was finant , but that &apos;s not true .
actually , he collected fish .
he described a very common one .
it was a grouper .
until the &apos; 80s , it was in great style .
now he &apos;s on the red list of endangered species .
this is a story we heard a lot of times from the galapagos , or other places , it &apos;s not very special .
yet , we still get to the galapagos .
we still think they &apos;re originally .
they &apos;re still describing them as untouched .
what &apos;s happened here ?
the second story is to think about a different concept that is changing .
because i studied it when i studied a lagoin in west africa in west africa .
i went there because i grew up in europe and i wanted to work later in africa .
i thought i could integrate .
and i got a terrible sunfire , and i was convinced that i really wasn &apos;t dead .
it was my first sunfire .
as you can see , the lagoam of palmas and a few manves fell around .
there was colorful of about 20 inches , black kins , a subspecies of the buntese .
the fish causes of this buntbarese were very skilled , and the fishermen lived well , and they were doing well in ghana .
when i got there 27 years later , the fish was thrown down half of his size .
they grow five centimeters .
they were genetically charged .
it was still fish .
people were still happy .
and the fish also had the luck to be there .
so nothing changed , and yet everything changed .
my third little story tells me about my peers at the introduction of the fish fisheries in southeast asia .
in the &apos; 70s -- rather at the beginning of the &apos; 60s -- europe has a lot of development projects .
fishing practices , which have already started 100,000 fish , called the industrial fishing record of this fairly ugly ship .
i went to it , and we made judgments throughout the south southwest sea and particularly in the javasee .
we didn &apos;t have words for what we started there .
i know now that it was the bottom of the ocean .
90 percent of our cogs were sponges , other animals that are connected to the reason .
the biggest part of the fish , the small dots there on the left , the flstill pile , were coral reefs .
basically the bottom of the ocean came to the deck and then it was thrown back .
these images are extraordinary because the transition is very quick .
within a year , you have a census , and then you start with the commercial fish start .
the reason is going to change . from this case -- in this case -- a hard reason or soft coral will be matgled .
this is a dead turtle .
they weren &apos;t eaten , they threw them away because they were dead .
we started a vibrant .
it was still not carved .
then they wanted to kill them because you could eat it well .
in fact , this mountain of truping is collected every time they &apos;re driving in areas where they &apos;ve never been resolved .
it &apos;s not going to document .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
we fit our implants to the new level and we don &apos;t call ourselves in memory .
if you generalize it , what happens is .
on the y-axis are a few good things : biodiversity , number of orca , the green of your country , the water supply .
over time , it changes . it changes because people are their actions , of course .
every generation is looking at the images that you get at the beginning of your conscious life , as standard and becomes all of it .
the difference is then being seen as a loss .
but they don &apos;t take the previous loss of loss .
there can be a sequence of change .
and at the end you just want to get the sleelest remains .
now , that &apos;s largely our goal .
we want to get things that are disappeared or things that are no longer like they were .
you could think that the problem is people who certainly knew when they were living in predators , killing animals and who were only aware of a few generations , which they had done .
because obviously , an animal is going to be very often , just once before it dies .
so you don &apos;t normally lose animals .
you lose rare animals .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not being seen as a big loss .
at the time , we &apos;re focusing on the big animals , and the ocean is the big fish .
they &apos;re getting happier because we start .
over time , there &apos;s little fish left , and we think that &apos;s the transportation .
the question is , why people accept it .
well , because they don &apos;t know it was different .
of course , many people , scientists , confirm that it was really different .
you &apos;ll confirm it , because the evidence , as you &apos;re in a former form , are not like you would like to get the evidence .
for example , there &apos;s the anecdote that the report of a capitalist &apos;s work , which looked like this in this area of big fish , can &apos;t be used , or by fishing scientists , usually , because he &apos;s not &quot; scientific . &quot;
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past even though we live in highly educated societies because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
this shows the huge role that can play a marine reserve .
because by marine reserves , we basically put the past back .
we put the past that people can &apos;t understand because the transportation changes , and they &apos;re very low .
so the people who see a marine reserve and they can benefit from the view that allows them to bring back their transportation .
what about the people who can &apos;t be because they don &apos;t have access -- the people in the middle of the west ?
here , i think the art and the movie may fill the gap , as well as simulations .
this is the simulation of chesapeake bay .
a long time ago , there was gray whales in front of 500 years ago .
and the color sounds , you might remember , &quot; avatar . &quot;
if you think about &quot; avatar , &quot; if you think about why the people were touched of it -- except from the pocahoneter &apos;s story , why were they so touched by image of imagery ?
because there &apos;s something going to be happening in a way that has lost .
so my recommendation , the only one i &apos;m going to give , is leads to cameron ii , so he &apos;s spinning &quot; avatar ii . &quot;
thank you .
in the &apos; 80s , in the communist east germany , you had to , if you had a writing machine , you had to do that in government .
they also had to review a sheet of words from this typetext machine .
the reason for this : the government could follow where a text came from .
they found a paper with flapping thought , they could figure out the creator of that thought .
and we couldn &apos;t understand how anyone could do something like this , and how much that would be the freedom of freedom .
in our own countries , we would never do that .
but if you &apos;re going to buy a new color laser in 2011 today in the top of the single laser printing printer and print one page , it &apos;s got light yellow flegs on every page , in a pattern that &apos;s clearly going to look at you and your printer .
this is what happens today .
and nobody seems to be able to rain .
and this was an example of which our own governments the technology against us , the citizens .
and this is one of the three main sources of existing things today .
let &apos;s see what really happens in the world : we can divide the attacks in categories .
we have three main groups .
there are online criminals .
for example , this is mr. dimitry golubow from gv in ukraine .
and the vocabulary of online criminals are very easy to understand .
these people deserve money .
they use online attacks to earn a lot of money , a huge pile of money .
there are several known cases of online a million , multimillionths , which made their money through attacks .
this is wladii tsai sin from tartu in estonia .
this is alfred gonzcoz .
stephen watt .
bjk sundn .
this is matthew anderson , tariq al-date and so on and so forth .
these people have come to wealth online , but they have illegal acquired , for example , using tjan to steal money from our bank accounts , while we &apos;re doing online banking , or the keylogger that collected our credit cards on the keyboard while we &apos;re going to shop online .
the u.s. intelligence agency , two months ago , the swiss account of mr. sam jain in here , and on this account , 14.9 million dollars of u.s.
mr. jain himself is on free-foot , the place is unknown .
and i want to suggest that today it &apos;s more likely that we &apos;re going to be victims of an online negotiation than one of the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is going to be worse .
in the future , most crimes will play online .
the second group we can see today is not motivated by money .
they are motivated by something else -- more protests , an opinion , or through their audience .
groups like anonymous has gone up over the last 12 months and have become one of the main players on the field of online attacks .
so these are the three main attacks : criminals who do the money because of the money , hackers like anonymous , who afford resistance , but the last group are nations , governments , governments that lead attacks .
there are cases of velinotar .
it shows unprecedented what happens when governments attack their own citizens .
velinotar is a full criminal certificate from the netherlands -- or was it .
in the last fall , it had to raise it , because velinotar had been hacked .
somebody had broken up and had a very bold system .
and last week in a meeting with dutch government , i asked one of the things that asked the question whether he was able to make it possible because of the forinotar guy .
and his answer was yes .
now , how do people die in a consequence like this ?
velinotar is a certified place .
they sell certificate .
what do you do with a certificate ?
now , a certificate is , if you have a website with https , with ssl-encrypted services , for example , gmail .
now , we use all of us , or a lot of us , gmail or one of their competitors , but these services are particularly widely used in totalitarian states like iran use , where dissidents of foreign venues are using gmail , because they know that they can have more trust than the local government .
but if you &apos;re in a foreign state .
the department of aviation is hacking and fake certified .
and that &apos;s what happened in the case of velinotar .
how does it look at the arab spring and the things that have happened in egypt ?
well , in egypt , in april of 2011 , the main headquarters in april of the egyptian intelligence police , and they found a lot of records .
in these records , a folder was called &quot; finproteomics . &quot;
and in this folder of a germany in germany , the egyptian government had a few programs selling a few programs that they had -- in very large terms of the egyptian citizens .
they had sold this program for 280,000 euros to the egyptian government .
the headquarters headquarters right here .
so governments provide total governments with aid so that they can use their own citizens .
but western governments help themselves .
for example , in germany just a couple of weeks ago , the state janans found , which was a trojan , which was used by german government for their own citizens .
if you &apos;re going to be suspicious in a criminal case , you &apos;ll definitely have a cell phone .
but today we are far beyond that .
they tap on their internet connection .
they use tools like the state janer to fool their computer with a trojer , which allows them to monitor their entire communication , their online discussions , to raise their passwords .
so if we think about things like that , the obvious answer would be people , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it &apos;s not because i &apos;m a braver citizen .
i don &apos;t have to worry !
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
and that argument doesn &apos;t make sense .
privacy has to be given .
privacy is not the debate .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and security .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
and as we today , in 2011 , our governments like trust , though , is all right , that we &apos;re going to wake up forever .
and trust us , we trust the blind of every future government , a government that we may have become in 50 years ?
these are the questions that we have to address the next 50 years .
it may seem strange , but i &apos;m a big fan of concrete block .
the first subjects block were made in 1868 , and they had a simple idea : radiation from zzhou with solid measured traits that fit together .
concrete building blocks were very fast in the world .
they put us in the position to build things that were bigger than we , buildings , bridges , a rock after the other .
essentially , the concrete building was taken into the block of our time .
almost a hundred years later , in 1947 , lego came out of this .
it was called the &quot; automatically rock rock . &quot;
and within a few years , legos moved in every household .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion stones were produced -- or 75 stones for every person on this planet .
you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to create beautiful houses , beautiful bridges or beautiful buildings .
lego made it possible for everybody .
lego basically has the concrete building block , the world &apos;s buildings , and it made a building for our imagination .
in the meantime , in the bell labs , the next year was announced the next revolution , the next building .
the transistor was a small plastic unit that was given us from a world of static , layered blocks to a world where everything was interactive .
as the block block allows us to build a lot more , more complex roundboards , a stone after the other .
but there is a major difference : the transistor was just for experts .
i personally accept that the building of our time is for experts , and so i decided to change that .
eight years ago i was at the media lab , and i started to explore this idea of how to do the power of engineers in the hands of artists and designers .
a few years ago , i started developing littgingits .
let me show you how they work .
and littgingits is electronic modules that have a specific function .
they &apos;re preconsistent , light , sound , engine and sensor .
and the best thing is that they connect with magnets .
you can &apos;t put them together wrong .
the stones are colored .
green is copy , blue is electricity , pink , and orange is wires .
so everything you need to do is connect a blue and a green one , and you can build a lot of circular circular .
they add a blue one to a green , and they can make light .
you can put a switch in between , and you have a little dimmer .
take the switch out around a pulsmol that &apos;s here , and they &apos;ve made a little blind .
put that buzzer for a extra effect and have made a noise machine .
i &apos;ll stop that .
beyond the simple play , littgingeness is actually quite powerful .
instead of having to code , you &apos;ve got to put it up , or you have to do littgingess , to code with simple , intuitive gestures .
so to slow the blind or slow down , just turn it on this button and make the impulse faster or slower .
the idea behind littgingits is that it &apos;s a growing library .
we want to bring every single interaction on this world into a productive activity .
lights , sound , solar elements , motors -- everything should be available .
we &apos;ve spread littgingeness to kids and to see them playing .
and it was an incredible experience .
the most beautiful thing is , how do you start to understand the electronics that surrounds you in everyday life and not study it in school .
like , for example , a night light , or why the doors end up , or how a ipod responds to touch .
we brought in littgingeness too .
so , for example , we had designers with no experience of electronic things that began to play with littgingits as materials .
here we see , with filz , paper and water bottles , like georgia ...
a couple of weeks ago we brought to risd , and we gave them some designers who had no technical experience -- only box , wood and paper and they said , &quot; what . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project that they made , a movable convention .
but wait , this is really my favorite project .
it &apos;s a hummer from dough , the fear of the darkness .
for those non-engineers , littgingeness became another material , electronics just became another material .
and we want to make this material available for everyone .
so littgingeness is open source .
you can go to the website , all the design in the design and make them .
we want the world to create the inventor , the inventor , because that world that we live in , this interactive world , belongs to us .
so , go ahead and start making it .
thank you .
