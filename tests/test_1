you know , one of the great writers in the travel , and one of the pleasure in the race research is to live with the people who are still able to remember the old days . they &apos;re going to touch their past , you know , on the surface of the plants .
just the idea that jaguggaans are still traveling beyond the milky way , or the meaning of the myth of the inuit of the inuit , or that in the himalayas , the buddhist is still tracking the breath of the dharma , which is the idea that the world in which we are living , is the idea that the world we &apos;re living in , is the idea that the world we live in , it &apos;s a sense of the fact that the world we &apos;re living in , it &apos;s a
and of course , we all share the same adaties .
we &apos;re all born . we get kids to the world .
we go through ritual rituals .
we have to deal with the unconditional separation of death , and so it shouldn &apos;t surprise us that we all sing , dance and art .
but interestingly , the unique sound of the song is the rhythm in every culture .
it &apos;s not a matter of whether it &apos;s about the penon in the forests of borneo , or the voodoo acoly7ine in haiti , or the warrior in the rice desert of northern kenya , the cures of the world that i traveled to in the desert , and this is a colleague that i &apos;ve traveled to in the desert , or this is a colleague that i &apos;ve traveled to in the desert .
all of these people teach us that there are others , other ways , other ways of guidance to the earth .
and that &apos;s an idea that , if you think about it , can be accomplished with hope .
together together , the myriad cultures in the world form a network of spirituic and cultural life , which is the earth and it &apos;s just as important as the biological life web that you know as a biosphere .
you can think of this cultural life web as a race of race , and race can be done as the total amount of thoughts and dreams , myths , ideas , inspections of the human imagination since the beginnings of consciousness has been formed .
the race sphere is the great legacy of humanity .
it &apos;s the symbol of all of what we are , and what we are as an astonishing species .
and just as the biosphere has been fixed , it happened with the race sphere -- just even bigger speed .
not a biologist would say , for example , that 50 percent or more of all species are just about extinction , because it &apos;s just not true , and yet , this -- the apocalyptic table of the biological diversity of the biological diversity -- hardly least what &apos;s known to us as an optimistic scenario in the cultural diversity .
and the critical indicator for this is extinction of languages .
when any of you born in this room , there were 6,000 languages spoken on earth .
now , a language is not just the full of the word or a series of grammatilation .
a language is expression of human spirit .
it &apos;s a means to find the soul of a certain culture to the tangible world .
every language is like an ancient forest of the mind , a turning point , a thought of spiritual possibilities .
and from these 6,000 languages today , as we &apos;re sitting here in monterey , the only half of them are in monterey .
they &apos;re not taught for small kids anymore . that means that if nothing is done , they &apos;re already dead .
what could be more lonely than being out of the silence , to be one of the last of your people , who speak language , no way to have the wisdom of the ancestors , or the hope children ?
and yet , this terrible destiny is actually happening to someone somewhere on earth , about two weeks , because every two weeks , because of every two weeks , one older person dies and takes the last silkets to the grave .
and i know some of you say , &quot; is it not better ? &quot; wouldn &apos;t the world be a better place if we &apos;re all going to speak a language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s be this language for yoruba . &quot;
let &apos;s be kogi . &quot;
and then you suddenly see how it would be if you couldn &apos;t speak your own language .
so i want to take you on a journey today through the ethnic nosphere , a quick journey through the race of race to try to understand what &apos;s actually lost .
now there are some of us who sort of forget that if i say , &quot; different possibilities of his , &quot; really different possibilities of his own .
for example , if you take this child of barasana in the northwest of the amazon , the people of the amazon , the people of the anakonda , believe they were marologically the milk of the east of saint snakes .
this is a people who are not cognitively different from the color and green different , because the sky is put in the forest , by which people depend on them .
they have a strange language , and they have a heitty script called the linguistic exotic gamer : you have to marry somebody who talks a different language .
all of these are rising in the mythological history , which is the strange one of these big houses , because of the mischeks of six or seven languages , but is that you never hear somebody who learns a language .
they just listen and start talking .
or , one of the most intriguing tribes i &apos;ve ever lived with , the waorani in the northeast of ecuador , was an amazing people in 1958 .
in 1957 , five missionaries were trying to display and make a severe mistake .
they threw sharp photos from the air down , which we would consider as a friendly gesture , so they forgot that these people had never seen anything about the rainforest in their life .
they took these photographs from the forest floor , trying to see behind the face or the character , found nothing , and realized that this is business cards of the devil and killing the five missionaries of the species .
but the waorani didn &apos;t just kill up with the spears .
they went through each other .
54 percent of the deaths happened through fission .
we went back to the genetiaology eight generations , and we found two cases of a natural death and when we asked people to do something about it , they gave up that one of the people was so old that he died because of his age .
but at the same time , they had a clear knowledge of forest , which was amazing .
their enemies were able to smell the urine of an animal 40 steps away and determine what animal species that was .
in the early 80- years , i got a really amazing job when my professor in harvard asked me if i was interested in going to haiti and to differentiate the secret societies that were used to make the foundation of duvalier and clay and the poison that was used to make zombies .
so to give you a sense of this hard , i had to think about this remarkable belief of the vosemiand voodoo isn &apos;t a cult of the black magic .
in the contrary , it &apos;s a complex metaphysical phenomenon .
it &apos;s interesting .
if i ask you to count the great world leaders , what would you say ?
christian , islam , buddhism , wyism or whatever .
a continent will always be left , because the guess was that in sub-saharan africa , there was no religious faith . of course there was one and voodoo is just the excess of this very profound religious thought that passed during the tragic civil mind .
but what &apos;s so interesting about voodoo is that living relationship between the living and the dead .
the living ones are the spirits .
the ghosts can be covered by the large water of water , to respond to the rhythm of the dance , in order to live the soul of living temporary , so that the acolyth for a brief moment becomes the god .
and i &apos;d like to say the voodoo won , &quot; you have to go to church and talk about god .
we dance in the temple and become god . &quot;
and because you &apos;re obsessed with that , you &apos;re going to be raised by the spirit . how can you get damage to ?
look at this amazing demonstrations : voodoo acolyths in a licestate , which is the fireend coal without burn , an amazing graphic of the ability to affect the body that it is holding in a state of extreme arousal .
now , from all the people i met , the kogi was from the sierra nevada santa marta in northern columbia , the most extraordinary .
offspring of the old tyrannial civilization , the navy state of columbia , went back to this people in an isolated volcanic empire that goes back across the department of the coastal coast .
in a blood supply continent , these people were the only ones who have never been conquded by the spaniards .
until today &apos;s day , they &apos;re governed by a ritual priest , but education is very extraordinary .
the young acolyths will be separated at the age of three and four years from their families , and in a perfect world of the finse world of the glacier for 18 years of the glacier of the glacier for 18 years , and two times from nine years , they voted metals in the lap of the great mother .
and during this whole time , you get culturally introduced to the values of your society , values that maintain the claim that your prayers and your prayers , the cosmic -- or we might say that the green -- balance .
at the end of the amazing initiation , you eventually went outside , and for the first time in your life , at age 18 , you &apos;re going to see a sunretreat , and in this crystal moment of the first light , when the sun starts to get to the elbow of the amazing landscape , when the sun starts to get to the elbow of the amazing landscape , when the sun starts to get to the pole .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
they call the older brothers and say that we are the younger brothers , for the destruction of the world .
now this level of intuition becomes very important .
whenever we think of native and landscape , we either cut out to rousseau and the old scaffolding of the nodding wild on what &apos;s going on in its simplictive thought , or on the other hand , and say , these people are more connected to nature than we are .
so , native are neither sentimental , nor are they being made by nostalgy .
it &apos;s not going to be a lot of place for the malaria of the asmat or the cold winds of tibet , but nevertheless , through time and ritual , you have an mysterious nimbus of the earth , which is not based on the idea of being aware of it , but in a far more subtle intuition , the idea that the earth is only exists .
now , what does that mean ?
it means that a small child from the swiss is growing in the belief that the mountain is an apu-mind , which is going to be a very different person , and a different relationship to this resource , and a different relationship to this resource or a different relationship to this resource or a different relationship to this resource or this place .
whether it &apos;s a place of a mind or a bunch of them , irrelevant is irrelevant .
the interesting thing is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and nature .
i grew up in the forests of britically columbia , and i believed that these forests are going to be there .
this made me participate in another person as my friends under the kwakitl , who believe that these forests of the place are of hukuk and the canthouse , who are living in the north of the world , ghosts who would live in the north of the world .
now , if you start to look at the idea that these cultures can create different realities , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries . like this plant here .
it &apos;s a photograph i just took last april in the northwest of the amazon .
this is ayahuasca , which many of you have heard of , the most powerful psychoactive preparat out of the repertoire .
what ayahuasca makes so intriguing is not just the pharmaological potential of this preparence , but it &apos;s the processing of it . it &apos;s actually made out of two different sources , which is a series of sticks on the ground , which is a series of these wooden tiles , which is a series of betaals , which is a series of betacarboline , which is a series of these wooden tiles , which is a series of betaals , which is a
this plant contains some very strong tryptamine to the serotonin , diinselic tryptamin five and dereguxydigens in very similar ways .
if you &apos;ve seen the yidentical momi , as you can do this stuff , that substance , the substance you create from different kinds of forms also , also , evolutionxydigens .
this powder is about to get out of the way that you get out of a didge , and you &apos;d say , &quot; by baroque paintings , &quot; and the landing on a sea of electricity .
it will not create distortion of reality , but the resolution of reality .
i even have with my professor , richard evan shulte , the man who led the psychec to the discovery of the magic mushrooms in mexico in the 30-year years , and i said that you didn &apos;t have the impact to experience a hallucination .
but the thing about tryptamins is that they can &apos;t be put in trouble because they &apos;re of course through the human gut , of course , using monoamin oxidase .
you can only be put in relation to some other chemicals that the mao denaturizing .
now the fascinating thing is that the beta is that they contain the liars in the liars , they &apos;re mao-chai , of the kind of thing that is necessary to make the tryptamine , so you ask yourself .
how can these people get out of a flora of the 80,000 species of adstrincal plants that are these two morphologically , who , if they combine this way , create a kind of biochemical version that &apos;s so much larger than the sum of its parts ?
we use this great euphemism , trial and error , which seems to be meaningless .
but you ask the indians , &quot; the plant speaks to us . &quot;
so what does that mean ?
this tribe , the cocozer , have 17 varieties of ayahuasca , which you all recognize at large distance in the forest for our eyes as a form .
and then you ask them how to do their taxonomy , and they say , &quot; i thought you knew something about plants .
i mean , don &apos;t you know anything ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
so , it turns out you take every one of the 17 varieties in full moon and you sing in a different volume .
now that doesn &apos;t bring you a ph.d. in harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting to count than a tribe .
now , problem--- the problem is that even those of us who have the symbols of the hard position of native americans , as orginiell and colorful , they somehow look at the past as the real world , which means the real world , which is our world .
so , the fact is that you &apos;re not going to remember the 20th century in 300 years for its wars or technical innovation , but rather than an era that we were in , and the massive destruction of the biological and cultural diversity of the earth is either activated , and the massive destruction of the biological and cultural diversity of the earth is either activated .
all cultures have been involved in the dance of new life .
and the problem is not technology .
the zepx-city did not hear less on the sioux than it was the bow and the arrow , when the americans stopped being , when they were the horses and horse jobs .
not change and technology threatening the integrity of race . it &apos;s power . ugly face of rule .
and wherever you look around in the world , you will discover that these cultures are not the set of the set . these are dynamic peoples , whose existence is being emitted by the detection of the information that &apos;s going on in the stream of the sun , and it &apos;s going to be a very nomaous of the south asian sea , which is , in fact , that it &apos;s a little bit of the place that &apos;s going on in the stream of the sun , and it &apos;s going to be a noma
or if we go to the mountains of tibet , where i &apos;m new , you &apos;ll see the ugly face of the political dominance .
you know , the genocide , the phyastic extinction of people in general , but the ethnic league , the destruction of the people &apos;s lives , will not only be convicted , but generally as part of a development strategy .
and you can &apos;t understand the suffering if you haven &apos;t seen it on the bottom level .
i used to traveled to a young colleagues from chredu in westchina in china , from south tibet to lhasa , and only when i came to lhasa , i was looking at the face of the statistics that were being killed by the fact that we were hearing , 6,000 million people that were being murdered in the assembly of the cairo .
the father of this young man was identified as hunting of the panch lama .
that meant he was killed during the chinese invasion .
his uncle fled with her holiness into the diaspora who brought people to nepal .
his mother was locked up when punishment for -- for the crime .
he was beaten up in the prison of two years into the prison to hide under her rock , because she couldn &apos;t live .
the sister , who did this tacking , was brought into an educational camp .
one day she came up with a armband maos , and she had to go into a tough job camp for seven years .
suffering is intolerable , but the spirit of people &apos;s mind is something unforttable .
and at the end of the line , we really have a choice . do we want to be in a monochromatic world of monotonia or in a polychromatic world of diversity ?
margaret mead , the great enabin said before she died that her greatest fear is that while we &apos;re moving towards a thread , we &apos;re going to be able to see the whole bandwidth of human imagination , but we &apos;re not just going to wake up the entire bandwidth of the human imagination , but we &apos;re not only stopping the entire bandwidth .
and it &apos;s humiliative to think that our species existed for 600,000 years .
the neolithic revolution , which brought us agriculture , and given us in this moment of the seed of the seed , the poetry of the apple crash gave rise to the prosa of the prieesthood , and the hierarchy , of specialization , came up with just 10,000 years ago .
the modern industrial world like we know it is hardly 300 years old .
now , these shallow history doesn &apos;t tell me that we all have answers to the challenges that we are in front of thousands of years .
if we ask these myriad world cultures after the meaning of human questions , they talk about 10,000 different voices .
and in this song , we will rediscover the possibility to be what we are : people with very conscious consciousness that are aware of the importance that all humans and gardens have to flourish , and there are great moments of optimism .
here &apos;s a photograph i took at the northern end of the baffel in islands when i went to the narwhan hunt , and this man , olquisian , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
the canadian government is not always very good with the inuit , and during the year of the year of our sponsor , they were forced to pull in settlements .
the grandfather of this old man refused .
the family , the fear of his life , took him all the weapons and all the tools .
now you have to know that the inuit doesn &apos;t have fear of the cold . they used it to their advantage .
the tracks were originally taken out of fish , and they were originally made out of fish .
the man &apos;s grandfather was not at night before the arctic night or the closing storm .
he hatched up to the outside , leaving his pants from sea dogsdrum and deated in his hand . and when the feces began fried , he formed the shape of a copy .
he sprayed to the side of the heel scanning , and when it was totally frozen , he had a dog .
he recapited the dog , and he improvised the dog , took the skeleton of the dog and improvised a bad dog , a different dog on the barrel of the ice knife on the belt .
you can &apos;t do anything like that .
and this is in many ways , a symbol of the resistance of the inuit and all the native people in the world .
the canadian government had the inuit in april 1999 , the complete control over a field , which is bigger than california and texas .
it &apos;s our new country , and it &apos;s called avlah .
it &apos;s an independent area . they &apos;re all controlling mineral .
an amazing example , like a nation , a state , a state that can do well with his citizens and can reach .
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who traveled to these distant goals of earth , to realize that they &apos;re not away at all .
they are the countries of somebody .
they represent parts of the human imagination that go back in times , and for all of us , the dreams of these children , how the dreams of our own children are part of the geographical hope .
what we ultimately try to do at national geographic is that we think politicians never achieve anything .
we believe that polemik -- we believe that polemik is not compelling , but we believe that storytelling can change the world and we &apos;re probably the best institution for storytelling in the world .
156 nations send our tv channel .
our magazines are read by millions .
and we do a series of trips to the race sphere where we take our audience to places from such cultural wonders , that they &apos;re looking at them , and hopefully they &apos;re going to adopt one of the things that &apos;s the central epiphany of anthropology in a really multicultural world .
thank you .
what i first want to show you , as quickly as possible , is to show the basic work , a new technology that we have microsoft as part of a year in front of a year , which is seadragon , and it &apos;s an environment where it &apos;s either locally , and it &apos;s an environment where it &apos;s either locally .
we see a lot of , many gigabytes of digital photographs here , which you can get out of selos and continuously , can rearrange in any way .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how many information we are looking at , how big these collections are , or how big the images are .
most of you are digital photos of a camera , but this one , for example , is a scan of the library library and it &apos;s in a field of 300 megapas .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference , because the only thing that the performance of a system like this can be constrained is the number of ceremony on your screen every moment . it has a very flexible architecture .
this is a whole book , an example of non-picture data .
this is bap house of dickens . every spold is a chapter .
to prove that it really is a text and not a picture , we can do something like this to really show that this is a real representation of the board and no image .
maybe this is an artificial way to read a book .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
this is a realistic case . this is a copy of the guardian .
every major picture is the beginning of a crank .
and that really gives you the pleasure and the good experience of reading a paper of a magazine or a newspaper , which is a kind of medium with multiple scales .
we also did something about the corner of this particular copy of the guardian .
we designed a false display with very high resolution , which is much higher than a normal display , and we added additional content .
if you want to see the functions of this car , you can see it here .
or other models , or even technical features .
and this really reaches these ideas to create these limits for available space on the screen .
we hope that this is not a pop-up and other nonsense -- that should not be necessary .
of course , mapping is one of the really obvious applications for technology like this .
and i really don &apos;t want to spend a lot of time saying that we &apos;re also going to contribute to this domain .
but these are all roads in the u.s.
overstanding on top of the wire on the top of nasa .
let &apos;s get out of it now .
this is even live on the internet now . you can check it out .
this is a project called photosynth , which connects really two different technologies .
one is a seadragon and the other is a very good research on computer vision , which is from noah pauling , a university student in washington , under the counseling of steve seitz at the uw .
and rick szeliski was done by microsoft research , a very good collaboration .
so this is live on the internet . it &apos;s driven by seadragon .
you can see that if we can create this kind of view where we can penetrate through images and make this experience more sophisticated .
but the spatial configuration of the images is actually inherently meaning .
the computer design algorithms have shared these images with the real space , where these images that were made all the way close to the grasshopehouse of the canadian rock in the canadian rockies . they &apos;re going to be able to see these things in relation to each other .
i don &apos;t know exactly if i have time to show you other environments .
there are the ones that are much more spatial .
i &apos;d like to show you one of the original data sets of noah , and this is from a very early prototype of photosynth that we &apos;ve been working on in summer to show you what i think is really the punchline of this technology that is photosynths , and that &apos;s not the case that we &apos;re looking at the environments that we have .
we had to worry about the lawyers and so forth .
this is a reconstructed of the cathedral dame , which was just in the computer with images of flickr , and just give it to an emergency lady in flickr , and they &apos;re going to get pictures of men in t-shirts and on the college site , and so every one of these orhes is a picture that &apos;s been revealed to this model .
so these are all patva images , and they &apos;re all in the same way in relation to each other .
and we can navigate in this very simple way .
you know , i never believed that i &apos;ll eventually work at microsoft .
i &apos;m very grateful for the reception here .
and i guess you can see that this is a lot of different kinds of cameras : everything is about the handy-camera camera , a pretty large number of them that put together all in this environment .
and if possible , i will find some of the strange ones .
many of them are covered by faces , etc .
there &apos;s a series of photographs somewhere here .
this is actually a poster of emergency dame , which was recorded right .
we can shift from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
the point is that we can do things with the social environment . it &apos;s now collected data from all the collective memory of how , visual memory of how , visual the earth looks -- and everything is connected to each other .
all these photos are being connected to each other , and it creates something bigger than the sum of the parts .
they get a model that comes from all the earth .
look at this as the sequel of the work of stephen law&apos;s virtual earth .
and that &apos;s something that the complexity , with the people using it , is growing and using the user using the use of the user .
their own photographs will be made with metadata , which has a different person .
if someone has the trouble , and all of these sacred complavers has been revealed , and they share who they are all , then my photograph of the emergency cathedral will be used with all of this data , and i can use it as a position to go into this space , and i can use it to go into this metaverse , which is the photos of other people .
and of course , side product all those are the immense virtual models of every interesting part of the earth that &apos;s not just due to flight or satellite images and so on , but by collective memory .
thank you .
do i understand you right ? your software allows you to make a certain time in the next few years , all the images that are used by someone in the world is basically interconnected ?
yes . she doesn &apos;t do anything else .
if you want to make it hyperon the edge of the images .
and it does this because of the content in the images .
and that &apos;s really exciting when you think about the amount of semantic information that many of these images have .
as you do a web search for pictures , where you put on sentences and the text of the website has a lot of information about it , which is the picture .
but what if the picture is associated with all your images ?
then the scope of the semantic cross-wire and the abundance that makes it really enormous . it &apos;s a classic network force .
blaise , that &apos;s really incredible . congratulations .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m going to tell you some things from my book , the way i hope to be in order with other things that you &apos;ve already heard , and i &apos;m going to try to create some connections , if you haven &apos;t noticed that .
i want to start with what i call &quot; official dogma . &quot;
the official dogma of what ?
the official belief of all western industrialized societies .
the official dogma works like this : if our goal is to maximize the collective well-being of our citizens , it &apos;s all about the most maximum of freedom .
the reason for this is that freedom itself is good in itself , valuable , sense , an undesired premise for the human .
when people have freedom , every one of us is for themselves to do things that are empowering our public good and no one has to decide for us .
the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice .
the more choices people have , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , the more common they have .
this is , i think , deeply immersed in our water supply that it would not come to mind .
and it &apos;s also deeply rooted in our lives .
i &apos;ll give you some examples of what modern progress allows us to do .
this is my supermarket . no big .
i just want to talk about salatdsburg .
there &apos;s 175 dings in my supermarket , if you don &apos;t count the 10 extra olive ovals , and you can buy 12 balsuals that you could buy to make a large number of pounds in the store for you .
so that &apos;s how the supermarket is .
and then they go to the consumer electronics store to put together a stereo -- speaker , cd player , a casame player , radio , stronger . and in this electronics , there are so many stereo .
we can put 6.5 million different stereo together from the components that are offered in this one store .
you have to admit that this is a big choice .
in other areas , the world of communication .
there was a time when i was a boy , because you were able to have every telephone you wanted to have , as long as he came from ma bell .
they rented their phone . they didn &apos;t buy it . marcel
a consequence of that was that the phone never was broken .
these days are over .
we now have almost an infinite choice of telephones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
my favorite one is in the middle -- nan3-style , nas-haek , and crème brée shows .
and you should not have seen that until now in your business , you can be sure that you &apos;ll soon be .
and what it does is it makes people walk into business and asking this question .
you know what the answer is to this question ?
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
it &apos;s not possible to buy a mobile phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
in other aspects of life that are much more significant than buying the opposite , the same explosion of choice to .
health care -- it &apos;s no longer the case in the united states that you go to the doctor and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , they go to the doctor and the doctor says , we could make a do or we could make b .
a has these benefits and risks .
b has this benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
and they say , &quot; doctor , what should i do ? &quot;
the doctor says a , a has these benefits and risks and b has the benefits and risks .
what do you want to do ?
and if you say , &quot; if you were , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not you . &quot;
the result is -- we call it &quot; patient autonomy . &quot; that sounds like a good thing , but in reality , a shift of the burden of responsibility for the meeting of someone knows -- naming of the doctor -- to somebody who knows nothing , and that &apos;s why not the best constitution is a decision to make .
there &apos;s an enormous marketing marketing for people like you and me , if you think about it , without any sense , because we don &apos;t buy it .
why do they advertise us if we can &apos;t buy ?
the answer is , you expect to call the doctor the next morning and ask for a change of the competition .
something so profound like our identity is now a question of choice like this slide .
we don &apos;t invent identity , we invent it .
and we often reinvent ourselves as much as we want .
that means that every day , if you wake up the morning , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time when the standard assumption was that almost everybody had one and that they were so fast as quickly as they could , and then quickly kids got as fast as they could .
the only real choice was &quot; who , &quot; not when , and not what they did afterwards .
now , everything is easy to have .
i teach amazing intelligent students , and i give them 20 percent less work than i did before .
and not because they &apos;re less smart , not because they &apos;re very carefully carefully .
it &apos;s because they &apos;re busy with other things , they ask themselves , &quot; should i marry or not ? should i get married ?
should i be married later ? should i have kids , or do they make a career ? &quot;
these are all objected questions .
and they &apos;re going to answer these questions regardless of whether that means all the tasks that i share and not get a good note in my course .
and in fact , they should do that . these are important questions .
work -- we are blessed , like carl light , with the technology that allows us to work every minute from every single day on the planet -- up to the marginant hotel .
there &apos;s a corner , by the way , that i &apos;m not going to tell you about , which is going to work .
i &apos;m not going to tell you , because i want to use it .
so what it means is that this incredible freedom of choice we have in terms of making decisions again , again and again , whether we should work or not work .
we can play our kids in football , and we have our mobile phone on one hip , and our blackberry on other hip , and our laptop probably on our lap .
and even if you &apos;re all off , every minute we &apos;re looking at our child in mutiling a football game , we also said , &quot; should i take this call ?
should i respond to this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
and even though the answer to the question , &quot; no , &quot; is not going to be a very different experience of the football game of your child &apos;s sake .
wherever we look , big things and small things , material things and lifestyle , is a question of choice .
and the world in which we were looking like this .
so i want to say , there are some options , but not everything was a poll of choice .
and the world in which we &apos;re now seeing lives like this .
and the question is , are the good news or bad news ?
the answer is yes .
we all know what &apos;s good about it , so i &apos;ll talk about what &apos;s bad about it .
all these choices have two effects , two negative effects on people .
a effect , paradoxically , is that instead of free to free .
with so many options you can choose , it falls very hard to decide .
i &apos;m going to give you another drastic example , a study about investment in volunteers .
a colleague of mine had access to investment records of vanhy , which is about a million employees from about a million employees and about 2,000 different jobs .
and what she found was per 10 investment fund that the employer offered , took the participation of two percent .
they offer 50 investment fund -- 10 percent less employees than if they would only offer five . why ?
because it &apos;s 50 investment fund for choice , it &apos;s so hard to decide that you &apos;re going to pick it up tomorrow .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , of course never comes .
you know , it &apos;s not just that the people who have to eat dog food , when they go to the retirement , because they don &apos;t have enough money to do it , it also means that they make a lot of investment for their employer .
they don &apos;t give up to 5,000 or 5,000 dollars a year in the workforce that would have been happy to reproduce their contributions .
paralysis is a consequence of many choices .
and i think it causes the world to look like this .
they want to make the decision really , if it &apos;s for all the time , right ?
they don &apos;t want to choose the wrong investment fund , or even the wrong saltations .
so this is the one effect . the other effect is that even if we overcome paralysis and make a decision , we end up with less content with the result of choice , when we had the opportunity to decide between less possibilities .
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is about the great choice of different salatdings , if they buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and what salatdsburg is already perfect ? it &apos;s easy to imagine that they could have a different decision , and what &apos;s going to happen is that they could have a different decision , that they would have a different decision , and what &apos;s going to happen is that they have a different decision .
the more possibilities , the more easier it &apos;s not to regret at all , it &apos;s disappointing to choice that you meet .
second , what economists call opposition costs .
dan gilbert has made a big point tomorrow by telling how much the way that we evaluate things , depends on what we compare .
well , if there &apos;s a lot of alternative to think about it , it &apos;s just very attractive to think of the alternatives that they &apos;re making , that makes them less satisfied with the alternatives they chose .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not new york , i apologize .
but here &apos;s what you should have thought .
here &apos;s a few on the hamptons .
very expensive real estate .
beautiful beach . great day . they have everything for themselves .
what could be better ? &quot; damn &quot; the man thinks , &quot; it &apos;s august .
everybody in my manhattan neighborhood is gone .
i could park right before my house . &quot;
and he spends two weeks from the thought that he missed the possibility of having a day on day , a great parking lot .
opperthotity goes down happiness that we get through our choice , even if what we chose is fantastic .
and the more possibilities for choice , the more attractive properties of these choices are going to look at the oppercratic cost .
here &apos;s another example .
now , this cartoon makes some statements .
he makes a statement about this now and maybe to do things slowly .
but an important point that he &apos;s doing is always who you decide for one thing , don &apos;t decide to do other things .
and these other things like a lot of attractive traits , and it will do what they &apos;re going to do less .
third , the expectation of expectations .
and this struck me when i wanted to exchange my jeans .
i wear jeans , almost the whole time .
and there was a time in which there was only jeans of one kind , and they bought them , and they have mislooked , they were incredibly uncompetitive , and they had a long time , and they would have failed to feel &quot; ok . &quot;
so to buy new jeans after many years of the age of the old , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have a few jeans , here &apos;s my height . &quot;
and the sales said , &quot; do you want to sit down , lightly or harder ?
do you want buttons or glove ? stone or acid ?
do you want a jeans with holes ?
if you want to cut down far , bite , blah blah blah , blah , he told me .
my jaw was down and after i went , i said , &quot; i would like to have liked the only way . &quot;
he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour trying to take all these damn jeans , and then the business -- and i say the truth -- with the best pasases jeans that i had ever had .
i had better . all of these choices allowed me to have better .
but i felt bad .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try and explain it to myself .
the reason that i felt bad was that i felt bad with all these possibilities , my expectations for what a good pair of jeans is , went up .
i had very low expectations . i had no concrete expectations when there was only one way .
when they came in in 100 ways , one of them would have been perfect .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so i tried to get what i was expected to do , and what i had was disappointing to what i was expecting .
adding the opportunities to the lives of people is inevitably increasing the expectations of people who are going to be good about it .
and this leads to less happiness with the results , even though the results are good .
no one in the world of marketing knows this , because , if you were , you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re doing here .
the truth is more like this .
the reason it was much better than anything was worse than anything was bad for people to make a pleasant surprise .
now , in the world that we live in -- we are wealthy , industrialized citizens , with perfection as an expectation -- the best for which you can be hope to be like you .
they &apos;re never going to be pleasant , because their expectations , my expectations , are high .
the secret to happiness -- that &apos;s what they &apos;ve all got to -- the secret to happiness are low expectations .
i want to say -- a short autobiographical moment -- that i married with a woman , and she &apos;s really wonderful .
i couldn &apos;t have done it better . i didn &apos;t stop .
but ablet is not always a bad thing .
finally , a consequence of buying a bad sit , if there &apos;s only one way to buy it , that if you &apos;re unsatisfied , you &apos;re wondering why , who is the answer . the world is responsible . what can you do ?
if hundreds of different kinds of jeans are available , and they &apos;re going to buy the disappointing , and they ask why , who is it ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer to the question is : you .
they could have done it better .
with 100 different kinds of jeans in the window , there &apos;s no excuse for mistakes .
and so , if people are making decisions , and even when the results of decisions are good , they feel disappointed about it .
clinical depression exploded in the industrial world in the last generation .
i think a significant thing -- not the only one , but a significant piece of advice to this explosion of depression , and also suicide , is that people have been experiencing the disappointing because they have to have their standards that are so high , and then if they have to explain these experiences , they would be their fault .
and so the image is that it &apos;s generally better to us , objective , and we feel bad .
so let me remind you .
this is the official dogma that we all think of right now is completely false . it &apos;s not true .
there &apos;s no question , which is a little bit better than not , but it doesn &apos;t follow more choices than something .
there &apos;s a magical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we &apos;ve been missing this point for a long time on the selection .
now , as a policy question -- i &apos;m almost done -- as a rule , the thing about thinking about . what all of these choices allow in the developed societies is the material of wealth .
there are lots of places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard about many of them whose problem is not too big .
your problem is that you have too little .
so the things i &apos;m talking about are a strange problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what &apos;s so frustrating , and is , steve levitt has told you yesterday about how these expensive and heavy car seats don &apos;t help . it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive , complicated choices -- it &apos;s not easy to help .
they even hurt .
they &apos;re going to make it worse for us .
if something that enables people to make the people of our society so decisions to the societies in which people have less choice , would not only improve the lives of people , but our dignity will be improved .
economists call this a pareto-enhanlation .
income elevates will be concerned that it &apos;s going to be better -- not just the poor -- because all of these big choices make us placebo .
finally , you read this cartoon , and , a highly developed person , says , &quot; ah ! what does this fish know ?
you don &apos;t know anything in this gold glass . &quot;
geites , a short-dense view of the world -- and that that &apos;s the way i first read it .
the more i thought about it , the more i got to the point of the fish .
because the truth is , if you break the gold glass , it &apos;s all possible , you have no freedom . you have paralysis .
if you break the gold glass , it &apos;s all possible , you reduce happiness .
they increase the paralysis and lower happiness .
everybody needs a gold glass glass .
this is almost with a complete security safety -- potentially for the fish , definitely for us .
but it &apos;s going to be a recipe by a metaphorical gold glass that is a recipe for misery , and , i suspect , disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects before , about the human genome and what that might mean , and about the discovery of new groups of genes .
in fact , we start from a new point : we &apos;ve digitized biology and now we &apos;re trying to get from the digital code into a new phase of biology by designing new life and building it .
we always tried to ask meaningful questions .
what is life ? it &apos;s something i believe that many biologists have tried to understand and that on different levels .
we &apos;ve tried different ways to simplify it up to the minimum components .
we &apos;ve digitized nearly 20 years , and when we sequenced the human genome , the change from the analog world of biology is the digital world of the computer .
now we &apos;re trying to ask if we can regenerate lives or can we make new life , from this digital universe ?
this is the map of a small organism , mycoplasma violin , who has the smallest genome of a species that can replicate itself in the lab , and we &apos;ve tried to do that with even smaller genome .
we &apos;ve managed to give it to about a hundred genes from the 500 or something that are here .
but if we look at this metabolic map , which is very simple , compared to our own . trust me , that &apos;s simple . but if we can see all of these genes we can eliminate one after another , it &apos;s very unlikely to take a living cell .
so we decided that it &apos;s the only way forward to the front of this chromosome , which allows us to vary the individual components and ask some of these fundamental questions .
and so we started asking the question , can we do a chromosome synthetic ?
it allows the chemistry to make this really big molecule , which has never been done before ?
and , if we can , can we start the chromosome ?
one chromosome , by the way , is just a piece of chemical material .
our steps at predicting life were exponentially .
our ability to write genetic code is very slowly , but nevertheless , and our final point would be on an exponential curve .
we started it 15 years ago .
it actually took some years to start with a bioethical review before we did the first experiments .
it turns out that dna origami is very difficult .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world who can make small pieces of dna , 30 to 50 letters long , but it &apos;s a degeneric process , so the longer you make a piece , the more mistakes .
so we had to develop a new method with which we could put these little pieces together and fix the mistakes .
this was our first attempt , starting with the digital information , the genome phi x 174 .
it &apos;s a little virus that kills bacteria .
we made small pieces , made an error miscorrect and a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
the exciting phase came when we took this piece of informed chemical and had a bacterium , and the bacteria started reading the genetic code and made viral particles .
and then the viral particles were released from the cells , and they would come back and kill polio directors .
i talked recently to the oil industry , and they said that they did this model precisely .
they laughed more than they do here .
so we think that this is a situation in software actually building its own hardware in a biological system .
but we wanted to go a lot further . we wanted to build a whole bacterium chromosome , and it has more than 580,000 letters of genetic code . so we thought we could build it in tapes from the size of a living cell .
design is the key , and if you want to start with digital information in the computer , this digital information really needs to be free .
when we first sequenced the genome , the error rate was in a mistake per 10,000 base pairs .
we found at reswells 30 errors , if we had used the original sequence , it would never have been possible to drive .
part of the design of design is to create pieces that are 50 letters long , and with other 50-letter pieces of data , to build smaller sub-units that fit together .
we have unique elements here .
you may have heard that we have watermarks .
think about it : we have a four-letter code : a , c , g and t.
triplets that letter -- these letters encode about 20 amino acids , and there &apos;s a single purpose for each of these amino acids .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , sentences , thoughts .
at first we just signed up .
some people were disappointed that it was not poetry .
we designed the pieces so that we could just cut them with enzymes , and there are enzymes that repair that and bring them together .
and we started making pieces , starting with pieces of data , to the seventh , to the seventh letter , to make these together together by 24,000-letter pieces to bring those together together , to bring them together until 72,000 .
in each step , we &apos;ve produced these pieces in overprint that we could sequence it , because we tried to create a very robust process that you &apos;ll see in a minute .
we &apos;ve tried to get the car consensus .
so , this looks like a basketball scyoff .
if we get to these really big pieces -- over 100,000 basencouples -- then they &apos;re not just going to be growing in e. coli , all the possibilities of modern molecular biology . and so we turned to other mechanisms .
we knew about a mechanism called homologist recombination , which is using biology to repair dna that can bring these pieces together .
here &apos;s an example of it . there &apos;s an organism called deinococcus radio durans of radiation .
you see in the upper field that its chromosome just falls apart .
12 to 24 hours later , everything has been combined again .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
these organisms can be totally dry , they can actually live in a vacuum .
i &apos;m absolutely certain that life exists in space and can move , looking for santa tic conditions .
in fact , nasa showed that there &apos;s a lot of it out there .
here &apos;s a one-shot of the molecule that we &apos;ve created by using these processes -- actually , we &apos;ve been using hefe-processing mechanisms with the right design of the pieces of pieces , and yeast automatically put together .
this is not a electron microscopic graph . it &apos;s a regular microscopic graph .
it &apos;s such a big molecule that we can even see with the light microscope .
these are footage about an duration of six seconds .
this is the publication that we did recently .
these are over 580,000 letters of genetic code . it &apos;s the largest molecule with defined structure ever created by people .
it has a molecular weight of over 300 million .
if we would print it with a writing size of 10 and less disposal , it would count 142 pages just to print this genetic code .
now how do we start a chromosome ? how did we reverse it ?
obviously , it &apos;s very simple with a virus . it &apos;s much more complicated to deal with bacteria .
it &apos;s also easier to do it in eukaryoness as we are : you just take the nucleus out and you get another one in , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;ve all heard about the cloning .
at archaebacteria , the chromosome is embedded into the cell , but recently we &apos;ve shown that you can do a complete transplant of a chromosome from a cell to another , and that can activate .
we had the chromosome of a microspecies species . roughly , these two are as far as human beings and mice . we gave some extra genes that we could choose that chromosome , we were able to break it up with enzymes , and it was very amazing as we put it in a cell -- and it was very amazing .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
in fact , we thought that here is the end , but we &apos;ve tried to get the process up .
this is the main mechanism of evolution here .
we find all kinds of species taken a second chromosome , or a third of any different , every time in a second to a species .
so people who think of evolution as a gene will have changed a lot of biology .
there are enzymes called the restrictions called the restriction that actually digest dna .
the chromosome that was in the cell has no ; the chromosomes that we &apos;ve added already .
it &apos;s been exvented in the cell , and it recognized the other chromosome as a stranger of the material , and so we only had one cell with a new chromosome .
it was staking blue because of the genes we added .
and after a very short time , it had lost all the characteristics of the species , and consecuted completely into a new species that we &apos;ve given in the cell .
all the proteins changed the membranes -- when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we &apos;ve seen .
it may sound like genome alchimie , but we can move the software dna to change things quite dramatically .
now i argued that this is not the echo -- that &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years of evolution .
and i argued that we may be able to create a new form of the chambran explosion based on this massive new species of new species based on this digital design .
why should we do that ?
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
we are growing up to nine billion people in the next 40 years .
to put it in my context , i was born in 1946 .
today , three people on this planet have existed in 1946 , in 1946 ; within 40 years , it will be four .
we have problems with food , fresh and clean water , medicine , fuel for 6.5 billion people .
it will offer a challenge for nine .
we need about five billion tons of coal coal , 30-plus billion barrels of oil . that &apos;s a hundred million barrels per day .
if we think about biological processes or any process to replace it , it becomes a huge challenge .
then , of course , there &apos;s all the co2 from this material that lands in the atmosphere .
we now have , from our discoveries from around the world , a database with about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the design components of the future .
the electric industry had a dozen components , and you see the diversity that came from that .
we &apos;re in the first line of the boundaries of biological reality and in those of us .
we have technologies today because of this fast laparoemethods to do what we called combined genetics .
we now have the opportunity to build a large robot that can make millions of chromosomes a day .
if you imagine these 20 million different genes , or to optimize these processes to make octopus , or drugs new vaccines , we can change more molecular biology than the last 20 years .
and it &apos;s just counting selection . we can select for life capability , production of chemicals or fuel production , and so on .
this is a shot of effective design software that we &apos;re working on , which is actually designing and designing new species on the computer .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know how it &apos;s going to look . we know exactly how its genetic code is going to look .
we &apos;re now focusing on the fourth generation .
you &apos;ve seen corn recently , which is just a bad experiment .
we &apos;ve got greenhouse fuels and third generation that will come out pretty soon , that will have much higher sugar differences , like darpa or different types of butanol .
but , as we think , the only way we think of biology as a greater impact without the cost of the cost on food or the limitation of their availability is when we see co2 as an initial material , and that &apos;s why we &apos;re working on cells that are going on .
and we think we will be the first generation of the fourth generation , and that in about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 is a method .
but in our discovery of the world , we have all kinds of different methods .
this is an organism that we described in 1996 .
he lives in the deep sea , about one-and-a-half miles deep , in almost cooking water temperatures .
it shifts co2 in methane by using hydrogen as a source of hydrogen .
we can study whether we can use carbon dioxide that could easily be put on production , convertate the co2 in the fuel to push this process .
within a short period of time , we believe we could be able to solve one of the fundamental questions of life .
you know , we really -- moderate of moderate goals like the whole petrochemical industry . right . if you couldn &apos;t do that at ted , where else ?
but the same thing we &apos;re working on right now is to use the same approach to the development of vaccine .
you saw it this year with the flu , and we &apos;re always a year back , and we have a dollar when it comes to the right vaccine .
i think that can be changed by being recombinant vaccines in the suburbs .
this is what the future might look like with changes , can be cut the evolutionary tree with synthetic bacteria , with synthetic bacteria , and perhaps eukaryonum .
we are starting to improve light from people . our goal is that we have a chance to survive long enough to do that . thank you .
on the last ted conference , i gave an introduction to the lhc .
and i promised back to you to explain how the machine works .
so it &apos;s so far . and for all those who weren &apos;t there , the lhc is the largest scientific experiment ever looked at -- 27 miles in diameter .
his job is to create the conditions that existed less than a billionth of a second after the universe -- and that to 600 million times within a second .
it &apos;s just amazing .
this is the machine underneath geneva .
we take images of these mini-giants all in detectors .
i &apos;m working on this . he &apos;s called atlas detector -- 44 meters in the width , 22 meters in diameter .
here &apos;s a spectacular picture of the atlas in designing the scale .
last 10th last year , the machine ran for the first time .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
it emats enormously in the control room .
it &apos;s a picture of the first radiation device that the entire route to go back to the lhc , then with a part of the lhc , to make a chunk of particles on the detector .
in other words , when we saw this picture on september 10th , we knew that the machine works , what a great triumph is .
i don &apos;t know if this is the largest juwel , or this , as someone went to google page and found the starting page .
it means we reached a cultural impact next to the scientific .
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine that had to do with these wires -- this golden wires here .
these wires run 13-four , if the machine runs on high-performance .
now , the engineers are going to look at them and say , &quot; no , you don &apos;t do that . these are little wires . &quot;
you can do that because if you go very far , you &apos;re going to get into something called superconductors .
so at minus 271 degrees , kolder as the space between the stars can actually touch these wires .
in one of the connections , between five thousand magnets in the lhc , there was a sponct defect .
so , with this , the wires get smaller and it &apos;s 13-thousand-odd , all of a sudden .
this was the result .
now , all of this is more amazing when you imagine that the magnet weighs over 20 tons , and it spread around about 30 inches .
so we damaged about 50 of the magnets .
and they had to remove what we did .
we rearrange them , repair them .
they &apos;re all back on their path now .
by march , the lhc will be operating again .
we &apos;re going to turn it down , and expect to be able to collect data in june or july , and put our journey on to find out what blocks of the universe are .
well , of course , in a way that gives rise to such accidents , the debate around the value of science and engineering in such boundaries . it &apos;s easy to reject something like that .
i think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that we move beyond our borders , the value of things like the lhc .
i &apos;m going to leave my final words out of a english scientist , humphrey davy , who , as i suspect , when he took the raw experiments of his textbook , he said , &quot; nothing is so dangerous for the development of human mind , that there &apos;s no such thing as a mystery of the human mind , that there &apos;s no such thing as a mystery of the human mind , that there &apos;s no such thing as a mystery . &quot;
thank you .
i &apos;m a writer .
writing books is my job , but it &apos;s more than that .
it &apos;s also my big , life-long love and fascination .
and i don &apos;t expect that ever to change .
but it &apos;s a little bit shorter about my life , and my career has happened to me that made me think about this work completely .
this particular event was that i &apos;ve been writing a book recently -- a biography called the &quot; marcel bee , &quot; flop , love zep-- , which , decided , followed differently as all the previous books in the world .
the result is that i don &apos;t care where i &apos;m going to come from , i &apos;m going to be treated as being the set of it .
seriously -- the rise !
so , for example , you &apos;re really worried about me , and say , &quot; don &apos;t you fear that you &apos;re never going to hit this success ?
don &apos;t you fear that you &apos;re going to write your whole life and never create a book that &apos;s interested in somebody in the world ? never again ?
okay , that makes really courage .
it would be worse if i didn &apos;t remember that i was going to talk about 20 years ago when i was a teenager for the first time , that i wanted to be a writer with the same kind of fear of fear .
people said , &quot; meeters don &apos;t have to succeed ? &quot;
do you have no fear that the humiliation of a tear ?
did you feel that you &apos;re going to leave your life in your life and never get into something and you &apos;re going to die on a rob , you know , your mouth is filled with the worse vendes of failure ?
so , you know , you know .
the answer -- the short answer to all these questions is : meety . tick .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
and i had always .
and i fear a lot more things that no one would be worried about .
like algae -- and other fearless things .
but , if it &apos;s about writing , i &apos;ve been thinking about , why ?
is that the sensible ?
is it logical that it should be expected by someone to be afraid of doing the work he feel ?
and what is going on with the creative entities that you make us insecure of the related mental state -- in a way that other professions don &apos;t do ?
my father , for example , was chemists , and i can &apos;t remember the situation in his 40 years as a chemist he asked whether he was afraid to be chemist .
with your chemist blockade , john -- how do you do it ?
it just didn &apos;t happen , you know ?
but to be fair -- the group of the chemists don &apos;t have about centuries of the centuries of alcoscopous manenful people .
we just writer to have this kind of reputation , but not just the writers , but the creative of all genres , seem to have this call to being mentally unstable .
everything you need to do is to look at the bitter death rates of really great minds from the 20th century that died young and often by your hand .
and even those who don &apos;t actually care about genocide had been neglected by their clients .
norman mailer : a moment before his death in his last interview , meetes of my books have killed me a little further .
a remarkable statement that you can do about your life .
but we don &apos;t even want to hear if we hear somebody like that , because we know this kind of statements since so long . we kind of have the idea that we have so internalized and collective that creativity and suffering is somehow related to creativity .
the question i &apos;d like to ask you today is , is this idea of you completely fine ?
don &apos;t you feel ? because if you just look at one centimeter , i don &apos;t feel at all .
i find them off .
and i think they &apos;re dangerous , and i don &apos;t want to see how they &apos;re taken in the next century .
i think it &apos;s better when we live our great creative instinct .
and i definitely know that it &apos;s for me -- in my situation -- very dangerous , start to disfine this dark path of guess -- especially in the fact that i &apos;m in my career .
this is -- look : i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m just about 40 years old .
i may have another 40 years in me .
and it &apos;s extremely likely that everything i &apos;m going to write from the world is being carried by the world as the work of my last book , right ?
i say it straight , because we &apos;re all kind of friends now -- it &apos;s extremely likely that my biggest success is behind me .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
these are the kind of thought that someone can do to start at 9 o &apos;clock in the morning , and i don &apos;t want to do that .
i would rather continue to do this work that i love .
so the question is : how ?
after a while of the reflection , i seem to think that i need to be able to write a way of looking at a kind of protective psychological construction .
in some way , i have to find a way to make writing a safe distance between me and my very natural bebitence about how the reaction is going to be on the written .
while i &apos;ve been looking for models for the past year to do this , i also looked for the past , and i tried to find other societies to see if they might have been better or rational ideas about how to help them with the emotional risks that are associated with creativity .
this is a quest that led me to the old greece , and the old rome .
please follow me , because the circle will come back .
but in the old greece and rome , people didn &apos;t believe that creativity comes from people , okay ?
they believed that creativity was a kind of divinative mind that comes from a distant , unknown source to people -- from unproven , unknown reasons .
the greeks called this divine dicger of creativity in creativity .
by socrates , he believed that he believed he had a studio , he had a long way to go away .
the roman had the same idea , called this kind of body lodo creative mind , a laparogenius .
this is great . the roman didn &apos;t really think that a genius was a particularly wise individual .
they believed that a genius was this kind of magical divine creature , which was believed that it literally lives in the walls of an artist studio -- about just as dobby , the house11 -- would come out and design the job of the work .
this is brilliant -- there it is , it &apos;s the distance that i talked about -- the psychological construction that protect you from the consequences of your work .
and everybody knew that it worked , right ?
the artist of aging was protected to some things like , for example , too much narcisissm , right ?
if your work was brilliant , you didn &apos;t have to look at it all for you . everybody knew you had this kind of body genius that helped you .
if your work blew -- not completely your fault , right ?
everybody knew your genius was something .
so the people in the west have really thought about creativity .
and then the renaissance came , and everything changed . we had this big idea . and this big idea was : let &apos;s put the human individual into the center of the universe -- all the gods and mystery , and there is no room for mystical creatures .
it &apos;s the beginning of rational humanism and people started to believe that creativity was completely from their own individual .
for the first time in history , people are listening to this , or the artists who call a genius -- instead of having a genius .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
you know ? i think it &apos;s a blog person to allow him to think he or she is like the vessel , how the basin and the essence and the source of all divine , creative mysteries is a little bit of responsibility to make them a little bit of responsibility to make them a little bit of responsibility .
it &apos;s like asking someone to swallow the sun .
and it turns out , and the whole violatory egos , and it creates all these unfolds expectations .
i think that this successes has defeated our artists for the last 500 years .
and , if that &apos;s true , and i think it &apos;s true .
can we change it ?
maybe an aging understanding about the relationship between people and the mystery of creativity .
maybe not .
maybe we can &apos;t just rationize the thought of 500 years of human growth in an 18-minute lecture .
and there are certainly people in this audience that would really be justiced scientific doubt about the notion of -- basically -- feen , people follow and feenmagic on their projects , etc .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey .
but the question i want to do is , why not ?
why not think about it ?
because it makes much sense as much as anything i &apos;ve heard about when it was about explaining the absolutely crazy thing of the creative process of the creative process .
a process that -- like everybody knows who has ever tried to do something -- in other words , everyone here -- not always behaved .
in fact , he can feel really paranormal .
i had recently met such an encounter as i met the extraordinary american divein ruth stone , which is now over 90 , but it was a long time for me to go to the ground , and she told me she was growing up in the restaurant virginia , and she said she could feel and hear a poem about the landscape .
she would say it would be a window of air .
it would roll on the land .
she felt when it came , because it would bring the earth under her feet .
she knew she could only do one such moment , and that was -- in her words -- laparorace like the devil .
she ran like the devil in her house as she was tracking from this poem , and it wasn &apos;t about that she had to get fast enough to a piece of paper and a pen , so she had to get it through her .
in other painting , she was not fast enough . she ran and ran and ran and ran , but she didn &apos;t get the house , and the poem ran through her , and she would go through it , and she would go through it , and she would go through it . she would move it on . she would move it .
and then there were these moments -- i &apos;m never going to forget -- she said that there were eye looking at them , almost .
so she goes to the house , and she &apos;s looking for the paper , and the poem goes through her and she reaches a pencil just as it goes through her , and then she -- she said -- she was like this with her other hand , and she would get it .
she ran the poem to his tail , and she pulled it back into her body and took it into the paper .
in these opportunities , the poem came up and intact on the paper -- but backwards -- from the last word to the first .
and when i heard that , i thought that this is a profound thing -- that &apos;s exactly how my creative process is going to happen .
that &apos;s not like my creative process -- i &apos;m not the channel .
i &apos;m a mouse animal . i have to get up to work at the same time , and i &apos;m going to sweat , and really uncomfortable .
but even in my mouth , sometimes i have this thing .
and i guess that many of you have done that too .
even i had work or ideas that came from a source of me , which i really couldn &apos;t identify .
what &apos;s that thing ?
and how do we deal with it without losing our minds , but to keep ourselves in the contrary health ?
for me , the best living example of how to do this can be tom waits . i was invited to interview him a few years ago .
we talked about this topic , and you know what ? most of the time in his life , tom was the embodiment of the cooling modern artist who was trying to get this uncontrolled creative impulse that was in him .
but then he became older and quiet . he told me he was one day in los angeles , and it changed everything for him .
he was driving up at high speed when he &apos;s suddenly hearing a little fragment of a tune , which , as it is in inspiration often , is heavy to him , and he wants to do it . it &apos;s gorgeous . he can &apos;t change it .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper ; he doesn &apos;t have a pen , he doesn &apos;t have a tape record .
so he starts to get these old beclipling in him , like laparoi is going to lose this thing and be drawn by this song forever .
i &apos;m not good enough , i don &apos;t do it . marcel
but instead of getting panic , he just stopped .
he finished all the thought , and he did something completely new .
he looked in the sky , and he said , &quot; houston excuse , can &apos;t you see that i drive car ? &quot;
marcel , i look like i could just write a song ?
if you really want to exist , come back to a cheap moment , if i can take care of you .
if not , there &apos;s somebody else today .
go and quane leonard cohen . liz
his whole process of labor has changed .
not the work itself . it was often as dark as ever .
but the process and the heavy beclipment that surrounds him was when he took the genius out of it , where he had nothing to be trouble , and he got back where he came from . he realized that there was no internalized , agonizing thing .
it could be a miracle , miraculous , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and the alien , uncles that was not quite tom .
when i &apos;ve heard this story , it also changed the way i worked and it has been saved .
this idea saved me as i was in the middle of the magazine process of laparobee , viagra , love , and i fell into one of these blobs that we all fall in when we &apos;re working on something and it &apos;s not going to work . you start to think that it &apos;s a disaster . you start to think that it &apos;s a disaster . you start to think it &apos;s disaster .
not just bad , but the worst of all time .
i started thinking , i should just put the project up .
but then i remembered what tom was talking about in the free sky , and i tried .
so i took my view from the manuscript and i spoke to my comment in the direction of the room .
i said loudly , you know , you know , you and i know both when this book is not brilliant , it &apos;s not completely my fault , right ?
because you see that i have everything i have , investment . i don &apos;t have more than that .
so if you want to have it better , you have to check up here and keep your proportion off .
okay . but , if you don &apos;t do that -- you know what , then the hell .
i &apos;ll continue to write , because that &apos;s my job .
and i want to show you that i was going to be here for my part of the jobs here . marcel
because ... at the end of it , it &apos;s like , in the end of centuries , in the deserts of the desert north america , the people in the desert north of the south bronx have accumhed with mr. dancers and music , which has been cut up for hours -- until the dawn of grass .
these fixed were always great , because the dancers were professional and they were fantastic .
but back and again , very rarely , something special happened . one of the favorites was actually overworld .
and i know you know what i mean , because i know you &apos;ve all seen this kind of performance in your life .
it was as if the time was abandoned and the dancer through a kind of pnete . he did nothing different than he ever did before -- 1,000 nights before , but all added together .
and all of a sudden , he found no longer in trouble .
it was illuminated by the inside and the bottom and everything lit through a divine fire .
as something happened then , people knew what that was . they called it in his name .
they put the hands together and they started singing : meetallah , allah , allah , god , god , god .
that &apos;s god , you know ?
the interesting historic pedestrian note : when the mobes brought in the southern spain , they brought this practice . the language changed in the course of the centuries of laparoallah , allah , allah pauling , that you &apos;re still struggling with and flencodances .
if there &apos;s something wrong in spain , something magical has done : meetal lah , olé , olé , allah , great , bravo , great , it &apos;s a glimpse of god .
and that &apos;s great because we need it .
but , the tricky part of the morning , when the dancers wake up themselves and recognizes that it &apos;s 11 o &apos;clock on a tuesday -- and he &apos;s no longer a fifth of god .
he &apos;s only an aging sterile with painful kknees , and maybe he &apos;s never going to go back to those heights .
and maybe somebody will never call somebody &apos;s name , if he turns . but what would he do with the rest of his life ?
that &apos;s hard .
this is one of the most painful corrections of a creative life .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so full of pa if they didn &apos;t believe that the most extraordinary aspects of their existence come from them .
if you may just believe that you &apos;re a force -- from an overwhelming source for a given time of your life , which is sent to someone else when you &apos;re done with it .
when we start thinking about it , it changes everything .
so i started thinking , and i think of certainty in the last few months , while i was working on the book , which is soon going to appear -- when the dangerous , frightening , very expected comment of my driving success .
what i have to say to myself is , if i &apos;m going to get crazy about it , i &apos;m going to have no fear .
not dishearting .
just do your job .
be there for your contribution , whatever he wants to be .
when your job is dancing , dance .
if the dumb divine genius , which is put to you on the side , you decide to show a bit of wonder by wonder by your effort , then you &apos;re pumping .
and if not , dance don &apos;t dance .
and meetolé ! wiser for all of this .
i believe in it and i feel like we should teach it .
marcel olé ! wiser for you , just for the reason that you have the mere human love and the sense of being there .
thank you .
thank you .
olé !
last year , i showed these two slides to illustrate that the arctic ice app , which had the size of the lower 48 million years , had the size of the bottom 48 to 40 percent .
but this doesn &apos;t push strong enough the seriousness of this particular problem because it doesn &apos;t show the thickness of the ice .
in a sense , the arctic ice app is the naked heart of our global climate change .
it grows in winter and shrinking in summer .
the next slide i &apos;m showing you is a time-lapse what happened in the last 25 years .
the permanent ice is covered with red .
as you can see , it &apos;s growing on the dark blue . this is the annual ice in winter ; and it cuts in summer .
the so-called permanent ice , five years old , or older , is almost like blood , which out of the body here .
in 25 years it &apos;s gone from here to here .
this is a problem , because warming is the bottom of the arctic ocean , where there are big amounts of frozen carbon dioxide , which , if it comes up , from microbes to methane .
compared to the whole amount of climate change in the atmosphere , it could double that amount if we cross this critical point .
today , in some flat lakes , in alaska , methane of itself is methane from water .
professor katey walter who is university in alaska with another piece of labor to another flat lake last winter .
wow !
it &apos;s good . the question is , how is it going to be us ?
and one reason is , this enormous heat warry warms greenland from the north .
this is a annual water flow .
but the volume is bigger than ever before .
this is the canary in the southwest basin in southern west greenland .
if you want to know how the sea sea sea flows is going down here , it goes into the sea .
these rivers take rapid .
on the other end of the planet , antarctica , the biggest ice mass on the planet .
last month , researchers found that the entire continent has a negative ice footprint .
and the west antarctica , which showed up a few underwater islands , is particularly strong in melt .
this is 20 feet height , like greenland .
in the himalayas , the third largest ice mass , you see new lakes that were a few years ago .
40 percent of all the people in the world get half their drinking water out of that melting water .
in the colorado , this glacier is the source of water for these city .
the water levels have increased .
but when they arrived , most of the water goes away too .
california was a 40 percent reduction in the gulf of the sierra ana .
this is the memory basin .
and the predictions , as you read them , are serious .
this austrockthouse all over the world leads to a dramatic increase .
and the disasters around the world have been increasing in a really extraordinary and previously unprecedented rate .
four times in the previous 30 years , as in the previous age of smallpox .
this is a completely unsustainable pattern .
if you look at this in the historical context , you can see what it does .
in the last five years , we &apos;ve produced 70 million tons of co2 all 24 hours -- 25 million tons of every day in the oceans .
look at the region of the eastern pacific , in fact , from the american continent of west and both of the indian subcontinents , where there is a drastic decline of oxygen in the ocean .
the biggest single factor for global warming , besides deforestation , which is 20 percent , is burning of fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the biggest biggest problem .
the united states is one of the two largest polluts , together with china .
and the proposal was to build lots of other coal factories .
but we begin to see change .
here are the ones in the last few years , with some green alternatives that were proposed .
this is a political argument in our country .
and the cohles and fllinds have spent a quarter of the last year spent a quarter of the last year to deliver clean coal , which is already a contradiction .
this picture reminded me .
around christmas , in my home at home in tennessee , a billion tons of kohly switches .
you saw it even in the news .
this is in our country &apos;s second largest waste river of america .
this was about christmas .
one of the commercials of cooking industry to christmas was this .
frosty the carbon is a pleasure , happy burger .
it &apos;s in the envelope and abundance in america , and it helps to grow our economy .
frosty , the carbon dioxide gets clean every day .
it &apos;s affordable , and it &apos;s worthwhile , and workers remain in lohn and bread .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
the most powerful mountain worker is the director of massey fermi .
let me tell you a very clearly . al gore , nancy w. osi , harry presidential , you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
so the alliance for climate protection has called two campaigns in life .
this is one part of her .
in coalergia , we see climate change as a serious threat for our business .
so we took it to the top time , to spend a significant amount of money to get a commercial action on the way to the truth .
in fact , coal is not dirty .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and still smells good .
so , don &apos;t worry about the climate change .
give us a silence .
acid coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
so let &apos;s make a tour of this modern , clean coal factory .
fantastic ! this machine is quite loud .
but it &apos;s the sound of the clean coal technology .
and yet the burning of coal is one of the main reasons for global warming , the remarkable clean technology that you see here , changes everything .
look at it precisely , this is the clean coal technology .
finally , the positive alternative with our economic challenge , and our challenge of national security .
america is in a crisis that economy , national security , the climate crisis .
the red thread that all relate to this is our dependence on carbon fuels like dirty coal and foreign oil .
but now there &apos;s a bold , new solution , to get us out of that misload .
supplies america with 100 percent cleaner electricity in the next 10 years .
one plan , america back to work , makes us safer and to stop the global warming .
finally , a solution that is large enough to solve our problems .
supplies america is new . find out more .
this is the last one .
it &apos;s about a new states of america .
one of the fastest ways , our dependence on ancient power , the dirty power of our world , to reduce .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
new investments to create well-paid jobs .
health care is new . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
there &apos;s an old african saying , &quot; if you want to be quick , go alone .
if you want to come , go together . &quot;
we have to get far , it &apos;s fast .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to start by asking you to think about the time of her childhood when she was playing the building .
while they realized how to grab out the hands and drag them out , they actually have to be learned , and they actually learned , and to solve problems through understanding and change spatial connections .
spatial thinking is closely connected to how we understand a lot of our environment .
as a computer scientist , inspired by the way that we interact with real objects -- with my professional advisti , and my colleagues , jeevan kalanithi , i started to wonder : what if we could use computers that are going to move out of a mouse , which is what happens to be a digital finger on a flat basis , which is what happens to be a digital finger .
this question was so focused that we decided to explore the answer , and sice was developed .
in short , a siatable computer is an interactive computer in the size of a cookie .
you can be moved with your hand , you can see each other , you can detect your movements and you have a screen , and a radio receiver .
much more important : are physically , because you can only move them through the building of the hands and access .
and the siwers are an example of a new generation of aid to manipulation digital data .
and if these tools are become more common and a conscious mind for their movements , each one recognizes each other and the hostile of our heritage with them , then we can begin to study new and entertaining interaction .
i start with some simple examples .
this sisticable is for the video game , and when i put it in a direction , the video will play forward ; if i put it in the other direction , it goes backwards .
and these interactive portraits take each other .
so when i put them side-by-side , they grab their interest .
if you &apos;re in denial , you &apos;ll notice that and you can get something nervous .
and they &apos;re also feeling their movements .
so an interesting consequence of interactions that we started to realize was that we could use common gestures on data , like the color that you can do with fluid .
in this case , we have three sikers as colorers , and i can use them to put color in the middle of the center where they mix .
if we overtake it , we can download a little bit .
there are also some pretty , very nice opportunities in education as languages , math or logic games where we can give people the opportunity to test fast and see the results immediately .
here i am -- this is a fibonacci series that i &apos;m doing with a simple program .
this is a game with words , which is a kind of mixture of scrabble and boggle .
basically , you get every round of every round of sisticable random letters , and as you try to form words , these over a dictionary .
then , after about 30 seconds , again , you get mixed and you have a new letter to try and explore new ways .
thank you .
these are some of the kids who came on a trip to the media lab , and i could move them , try it and recorded a video of it .
they really loved it .
an interesting thing about this kind of applications is that you don &apos;t have to give people many orders .
everything you have to say is &quot; the words &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
here &apos;s another couple of people who test it .
this is our youngest speaker down there right there .
it turns out he wanted the sickers to do it .
so for him , they were just construction .
this is a interactive misframe .
we wanted to design a tool for language learning .
this is felix .
he can bring new characters to the scene by pulling the sisticable from the table to this figure .
here he goes to the sun .
the sun goes on .
now he &apos;s catching a tractor into the scene .
the orange tractor .
good work ! yeah !
by shaking the authorities and putting them side-by-side , he can make the characters interact ...
... his own story invent .
hello !
it &apos;s a story with open end and he can decide how they evolved .
flying cat .
the last example , for which i have time to show it , is a musical sequence of life for life stations , which we &apos;ve recently developed and in the sigrful as the leadership , like leadership , bass and battations .
each has four different variations ; you can choose what you want to use .
and you can put those sounds into the sequence that you can put in any patterns .
and you put it in by simply holding a tonable tone to a sequence of design .
there are effects that you can change live , like reverberation and filters .
you connect it with a particular note and then it tends to make it .
and then nevertheless effects like speed and volume , which you use on the entire sequence .
so let &apos;s see .
we &apos;re starting to eat the leadership in two forms of imaging and put them in a row , they extend and add a little more of the voice .
now i add a bass .
now i &apos;m going to do something about it .
and now i put up the filter with the stuff , so i can steer the effect of living .
i can accelerate the whole sequence by drawing the pace into one direction or another .
and now i &apos;m putting up the filter with the bass , for something more .
i can visualize the sequence while it &apos;s happening .
so , i don &apos;t have to plan them in the field , but can improvise ; they &apos;re extending or obsolete .
and finally , i can wipe out the whole sequence by spreading the sound force to the left .
thank you .
so as you can see , my excitement is to develop new human computer interface that fit better , like our brains and bodies work .
and today i had time to show you a part of this new design world and some of the possibilities that we work on in our lab .
the idea that i &apos;d like to leave you with is that we are at the threshold to this new generation of values with digital media , the information in our world , which is our demands .
thank you .
i &apos;m happy to talk to you about all !
yeah , good afternoon .
i &apos;m glad i &apos;m there .
yeah , so what &apos;s going to be biohacking ?
i just have to get a little bit of it , and that &apos;s biohacking with the modern molecular biology .
i study molecular biology , and i &apos;ve just been studying a couple of years now with the biohacking , and that &apos;s what i started , because i just wanted to know , and i wanted to do it , especially , what i learned in college .
so , that was my primary motivation .
so it was a curiosity , and i somehow wanted to get closer to the matter , so .
i think the molecular biology is generally speaking now , so in general , biotechnology , everything you count , synthetic biology and so on .
extremely important is , now , extremely important , and much , much more important will be in the future .
there are so controversial things like this all the genetic things that are affected in the branches .
there are now craig venter in the united states trying to make biofuels , so gasoline from algae .
and then there &apos;s some things that have come completely in the day-to-day life , which is most of the people who are not aware of it , for example , washing enzymes that allow us to wash with four degrees of laundry , are also genetic breeding enzymes .
and you can continue the list .
and so from interest in this technology , i just went on there .
so what &apos;s going on ?
most people know that most people know that from the software area .
computers glaze , and then it will always break into the media , and the hackers are falling somewhere and claws and so on .
it &apos;s kind of sad for the hacking scene , because that &apos;s not true , because it doesn &apos;t really start what it actually did , and what &apos;s actually behind it .
and that &apos;s the software hacker , in the seventh &apos; 90s , with computer engineering , and it &apos;s also created the internet .
and it &apos;s about a playful , creative , original way to solve a problem .
and the problem is that it &apos;s not just a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can just be an issue of problem , which describes how things simplify , a question of a question , and how you can do that better .
and it &apos;s been done with software , but it &apos;s also in the electric domain , because there &apos;s also a whole construction scene that &apos;s going on with electric sauce , all kinds of things .
and now in the direction of biology , and that &apos;s where i want to take this metaphor that comes out of synthetic biology , that biology is actually an information science , because , the d.n.a code is an abstract code , and it &apos;s not just the same way that the d.n.a code is an abstract code , and it &apos;s not just the same .
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can also program it and you can also compute it , so that i found it incredibly fascinating , and i just wanted to get a lot deeper .
in fact , it really first accepted a thousand and a half , these networks .
there &apos;s hackers pauling org , which is originally from switzerland , which is based on europe and with cooperation in india , but now members of people all over the world .
this is a more artistic orientation , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers , and in collaboration with scientists , with these kinds of technologies and asking questions of these technologies , and the creative process , there &apos;s a museum scenario , and there &apos;s a museum .
but in fact , it &apos;s always about finding such a curer access , such a playful way to have it .
and then there &apos;s mutual self-assembly organ org , d.i.y.organic .
this is from the united states a network , which is actually more like a kind of forum , where where you find yourself and online .
they &apos;re a little bit more technical , and also a little bit of business on the road , and then they &apos;re asked , yes , asking questions .
and from these networks that have made the whole popular , it has evolved to develop a scene that i &apos;d like to do briefly .
here in the image on the left , you see biooxi, that &apos;s a hackerspace , so basically a kind of school , a private school , a nonprofit where everybody can come .
kids , old , all kinds of people go there to just engage them , they have a lab , and they look at what you can do when these lab shows .
there &apos;s a group on the left on the left here , in indonesia , houp opies called the one that &apos;s already quite a long time .
even longer than these other two networks .
and they &apos;re also engaging in such an artistic aspect with biological materials , and , yes , electric builds , and combine that in quite a way .
a group of ankara , which i met a while ago , which is a student group , who would like to sell the public to more and more what they &apos;re learning in the university of the university , and they &apos;ve been doing it on street , and they tried to explain what d.n.a is .
and i have on the top on the other image a lecture in copenhagen in the medical museum in combination with a show .
and this is , yes , that &apos;s mostly pretty young people , but the only thing that is actually all united together is this fascination .
and what you can do with that , and you can also engage in the society , and ask , &quot; okay , what do you want to do , what do you want to do , have your interest in this ?
so , o.k , in order to hack biology now , you need some material .
you need biological materials , of course , and you need tools , and that &apos;s a lab .
in addition , what you usually understand in a lab , these are kind of the kind of driving machines , extremely expensive , undistance , just for professionals , trained academics and so on .
and our approach was to say , horizontal , that you don &apos;t have to do it .
it &apos;s actually not necessary because every coffee engine has actually evolved higher technology than most lab devices , which is really like this .
and then with this premise , with this premise , it has tried for example brian degger in england , which is a minimum print , and then it took a pressure pressure , a heat plate , and , yes , so cyentery , and then we grew up with bacteria .
so every one of them , which is a soup of soup that he left too long , even before .
i was trying to do this in my lab , a little bit , and then i would buy so dry gear on ebay , and i did a little bit of the d.n.a analysis , trying to do a father , so that so / d.n.a finger .
that &apos;s not supposed to be a joke now , but .
here at the bottom of the picture , you can see that the lab , in anleadership , is so much of the garage with the same kind of lab in the university of the university , a group of it in paris , which is what ended up and quite quite interesting things , and that &apos;s where i &apos;m going to be doing a little bit of a project .
and this is bioventilating , which is also called hackerspace , which is a kind of folk school , basically for molecular biology .
and yes , you see , it &apos;s relatively accurate , so there are people who are doing this at home , and so far more organizations that are going to do that in the institutional form .
but always the way that the approach is that it should just be accessible and accessible .
the first project we &apos;ve done as an international group , as we were sort of aware of ourselves , in our own selves , and we &apos;re now here as real scene , and we &apos;re online , and we &apos;re all familiar with people who are getting there .
and then came from the do-it-yourself organic website of the founder , and has said o.k , we also have to meet ourselves now , and also have two events , and then put two events , one in london , two , 10 thousand , and shortly in the united states .
and then , since then , it was also about , yes , bask , who are we what we want , what do we want to share ?
and what are our values and what are our target , our foundation ?
and then we &apos;ve been working on a code-scope .
that was quite intuitive , so everybody has just loved his wishes , his and what &apos;s going to move it , say , &quot; then . &quot;
there was , i think , a very good code .
and then we do not have it , but that &apos;s what i think is , i think , has gone pretty well , that people are quite convinced about this .
and we actually tried to bring that back into academic world , but it &apos;s kind of not that arrived .
so i think we &apos;re from the biohacking scene in the ways that the academic world .
now , what kind of projects do we actually do ?
a project that i did with the hacker network in switzerland was that we wanted to create an optical event or optical brush .
this is , if you &apos;re going to focus a laser bar on one in the room , you can catch little particles in the air or in the liquid , and then move into that focus , so that &apos;s there , so it &apos;s captured there , so it &apos;s stuck like this .
this works really , that will be done in academia , and we thought , you know , bask , we might have a webcam , we might have a webcam that &apos;s going to cut the lens , turning the lens , turn it down , turn it down .
this is what you see down there .
and then we swallowed a d.v.d torner and pulled the burning laser out and try to focus on this camera .
and unfortunately , it didn &apos;t work , but we still learned a lot about it .
so another project that made out of the french group from paris , that worked , is pretty cool .
and it &apos;s such a sort of a brain wave device , so e. e.g or something like that , so he &apos;s dealing with neurobiology , his nickname is sam neuroscience .
he then came up with this helmet there , and in cooperation with the museum , that ran .
and then there was the visitors going into the room , sitting on this chair , sitting on this helmet .
and then their brain waves were measured , and depending on what they thought they &apos;ve thought , is then different lights in the room .
it was quite a nice project .
another thing out of the united states is to do that with this dad &apos;s history , is the p.c.r , which is the polymerase-base response , complicated word .
so it &apos;s about copying genes , to reproduce , to reproduce , the d.n.a , fragments to make them visible .
so if i do that now , the profiler of the crime site , then they go , collect all of these hairsamples , and then they &apos;re going to take that method , and then they can say , &quot; o.k , this hair , this hair . &quot;
and the machines that do this kind of stuff are quite expensive , that you buy commercial , the cheapest you go at four thousand euros .
and it &apos;s not in hobbym , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that can also do a lot .
so this is just an application of many , which you can do with it .
and they have , you know , there are two builders , and they said o.k , we &apos;re going to make it easier and cheaper , and then just made out of open source , so free hardware , electric electronics , electrifical hardware , electrifical hardware , which is what this device is going to put together .
i think it &apos;s kind of like six and something like that .
but anyway , it &apos;s still not cheap yet , but it &apos;s definitely in a frame where it &apos;s becoming clear .
so i think it &apos;s a very common hack .
a project i had recently started to build was a gun gun .
gene-gun is , yes , such a kind of air print , which shoots about it so far , two centimeters or something .
you charge d.n.a at gold particles , and the gold particles then put into these air pressure , and then i &apos;ve got it shot up on onion , and then they brought it to light .
so the device you see there doesn &apos;t work .
but that &apos;s my prototype , but it looked pretty much like this , which looked like this , on a branch like this , the thing on it , electronics and pressure , and that was the pressure that was broken .
and then i took a saddle and i put it into it .
a satch , if you do the full power with water , has enough pressure , so i think so 40 to six of the six folds .
and then you can make the particles strong enough , and then you go into the comfort .
and the commercial device costs about five thousand euros or something like that , satreespendes around the 50 .
so it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically a time .
and this is the moment that the real cause of the scene is to increase this availability of technology and increase the information and the prediction that more people can get there .
because , as we said at the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have very little idea of it , and also not a chance to make it really good .
because if you just read about it , from secondary literature , it &apos;s not the same as if you &apos;ve done it yourself or you &apos;ve seen it .
and i think technology is becoming more important in our modern societies .
and if you want to make a more informed citizen in society , and you want to be able to talk to you , you want to have access to knowledge and technology .
and you also have to do it and understand it and understand it .
and then , you know , in the words of the number of words , it opens and citizen science .
so it turns out that as citizens , it &apos;s being put into the position of dealing with these scientific technologies .
and that &apos;s the real cause of the biohacker .
these are the people who have at least dominated at least in the website , d.i.y.bio website .
this is a relatively remarkable number of people around the world .
and what &apos;s interesting also is that they &apos;re also in southeast asia .
that &apos;s me , i think , are there less people than they are in fact .
so i know about some people who don &apos;t have it .
and these are just the biohacker , the individual people .
in part also , with these fellows , that &apos;s where these places come together .
and that &apos;s in the beginning .
as i said , it only has begun .
and hacker, the computer hackerspaces , because the c-base in berlin was the first nine year-old nine-foot .
and this is now a giant network of very good , yes , infrastructural centers that are represented all over the world .
and what we hope , of course , is that we &apos;re going to take a lot of time to spread and then be very closely connected , so that there are more people involved .
and i would invite everybody to deal with it , and even to try and do whatever .
it &apos;s not so easy , but it &apos;s not impossible , if you have enough curiosity , and you get enough energy , you get there too .
thank you for listening .
that &apos;s it .
yes , hi .
how do we actually do people ?
this is a question that really moves me very much as a designer , but also in the area of the research area in the field of the research .
it &apos;s about how to study people in interactive media so they can use this interactive media and make it a good satisfying experience .
because i believe that the interactive media in our archaic , cognitive models are mapping , so thinking patterns that have been programmed in our biological memory very , very long , and that we can only resociate through interactive media .
and this is very amazing because you actually believe that these high-technology that you &apos;re looking at is that this is actually going to bring you to the future , but in fact , that the future is right to us , in our archaan roots .
what are now archaic models ?
i &apos;ve signed up four words , and i &apos;d like to quickly explain to you .
to galvanaese cognitive models , that &apos;s the models we have in the pre-industrial times .
to these archaan models , we heard that we have a virtual relationship to virtual property .
it basically sounds unusual .
i &apos;m going to go back to you , and i &apos;ll prove you to prove that also you have a natural ratio to virtual objective .
the second aspect is that we &apos;ve been able to be able to speak very , very , very , very , very , very , though we &apos;re using a functional language .
and the third section , actually explains itself .
we all know that the interactive media is in definition , which involves the populity of the linearity , which of course says that we feel the linearity today as normal .
the fourth point is that the story for us is a place of information .
what is now with the virtual objective that is actually the most natural thing in the world .
i want to prove to you that .
how many doors does it have the house where they live ?
we &apos;re not going to be able to answer them immediately , but this is what happens , and it &apos;s happening right now .
they go in the spirit of this house , in foren , and look at how many doors there are .
and that &apos;s what they do .
they &apos;re virtual reality , and it &apos;s completely without computers .
fantastic , right ?
and we &apos;re spending a lot of trouble on the guinea campus for example the virtual reality lab in our v.rs lab , we can actually do it all the time .
and this wealth that really leads the virtual reality to virtual the reality that people have used in the pre-industrial times , because they didn &apos;t have anything .
they didn &apos;t have books .
or they didn &apos;t have a photo totography .
they had no mass media .
the only thing they had was her head .
and in this head , the memory was playing .
in this head , knowledge was called , and using this virtual images , the imagination , it was also passed away .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s so strong in us that we can deal with virtuality so well .
the interesting thing is , if i can do a little trip .
yeah , it goes .
the interesting thing about this is that at the time of human beings , the media producer was media producer .
now , if you think of a little bit further .
what are media today ?
then you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s been a change .
but i &apos;ll just talk to you again .
essential tool of information education has been for jevers for many stories .
shagrans , priests , so-called knowledge guards , were more than to keep knowledge in stories .
and today we &apos;re still very , very strong to stories .
the author of the book the solidaralicheall , jonathan gotcheall , so we still found a hundred hundred and a half hours of the reception of stories .
that means a child that has spent it to reach the most of the cost of most of the time in his life .
now we think our love depends on stories that we were sitting on the lap of our parents .
no , no , far missing .
this is a lot further back to culture of pre-industrial times .
but for me , in the field of interactive media as special as it is that we &apos;ve invaded our biological memory , the ability to think nonlinear .
i brought to you an example of the north american tribe of nootca-indian .
and life lived in the coastal region of british columbia .
and as you can see , this is a very island area , and you had to sort of navigate from island to island to get food .
and they did this with something called lead-land maps .
you may know that if you &apos;re interested in doing a little bit about the australian folk people .
they have similar principles .
they don &apos;t have lead-land maps , but they have used the genets that are used as well as they were .
and what &apos;s interesting about this is that the navigation and the topography of regions were being mapped across songs .
in addition to language , the language was subordinated by subended .
that means you blend over sound and above rhythm .
and these sound and the rhythm have the geology , the topography of a region , and , of course , that also allowed you to dedifferentiate these songs , and then it could move back to the left , to the right .
why don &apos;t we sing anymore to get from the top to a b ?
anyway , not to navigate .
what &apos;s actually happening ?
this is what &apos;s happened as nannanene age age .
we &apos;ve moved back to the so-called age age .
what happened is that machine age is happening , and what happens is the book is , and it &apos;s the photolitography .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens that we have the responsibility for our memories and the production of our individual memories of our individual memories .
on the book and on the picture .
so unfortunately , unfortunately , we have god &apos;s play a bit more enduring .
virtual objective suddenly become strangeness to us , and it has nothing to do with reality .
bruce brown , a famous design researcher at brighton university , is so far to say that these mass media , he means the book , and the image , which is not the tv , the internet , and so on , what we call the mass of our memories , the internet , the internet , and so on .
let &apos;s do a little interverse .
from the vogt age to the machine age .
what has impact on our thinking and our minds ?
then we have the impact effects of the suburbs .
and those are over the course of centuries more and more written by the impact of the machine age .
that means that instead of remembering ourselves , we have standardized , widespread , common patterns of memories that we can depend on our personal memories .
we don &apos;t produce more ourselves .
we have an abstract language language .
we don &apos;t think of the thing more in images that are no longer in pictures , but we serve them our language .
we &apos;ve been used to things that are linear happening .
and we &apos;ve accepted the linearity as a law , and there are only exceptions , like the non-linearity .
what &apos;s left us is the echo .
still , we &apos;re the echo as information training , very strong .
the question is , what &apos;s next ?
we had the age of the age , we had the machine age , and we were now talking about the so-called cyber age .
it sounds very smooth , and it sounds very much like science fiction , i know .
but these concepts of cyber age , which bring us back to these possibilities again .
it &apos;s about virtual functionity , it &apos;s about nonlinearity .
i want to explain a little bit about this .
there are technical concepts like augmented reality , which means the extended reality .
so if you look at google lear for example , then a concept of what makes us reconnect the virtual world with the real world , which means our monkeys to make a virtual sense , the virtual , natural , to feel again .
another example is called the virtual reality .
so crazy , of course , in the context of my talk , because we &apos;re going to be physically growing in not existing , virtual worlds , just after the model of the primate .
and other examples are the ambient , smart systems .
these are spaces that can respond to a human being .
all this needs the ability to accept our fundamental ability to be virtual as a real habitat .
i have a degree , and i hope that the video works , a very , very beautiful project brought together , which is the bachelorwork of michael burk , and joris blater and janis moritz .
and the two more people are here today .
maybe you can stand up for a minute so you can talk to the two about the project .
and this project i brought together as an example , as again , on this archaic , cognitive landscape .
the whole thing is a game i have to say .
what the rockefeller of course is , and it &apos;s a computer game .
and if i say a computer game , you probably have a very likely to tell people that there are people in front of some consoles , or that they play with the mit with any console in the hand .
anyway , they do it .
this is a game for outside .
and that &apos;s meant that i thought i would discover the outside world , so i rediscover the real world .
and this game connects the virtual world , so the data is the data that we produce , with the real world .
i apologize to be so high .
you can then explain that much better , because there &apos;s much more behind it .
and that &apos;s because i discover a city by looking at what was positive or negative .
and so i get a very different view of the city , a very different impression , which is , i see negative and positive zones of a city , and i get this kind of , virtual map of a very real city .
and we now like to look at this .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is another little explanation of what you &apos;re looking at .
of course , this virtual world lives in the walls of our cities .
and with a kind of backlight , we can visible these virtual worlds .
so , i just like to wrap this up to my talk , and in the sense that the properties and the skills that we &apos;ve acquired from the voe age , and we &apos;ve gone to that kind of thing , in the same way that the cyber age could be reactivated , and that we can actually come back to our roots .
thank you .
yeah , i &apos;m very excited to be with you .
i &apos;ve been asked if this bag is there , and i &apos;m going to talk to you instead .
it won &apos;t do that .
i &apos;m also going to evaporate what &apos;s inside .
but i just do it very much .
yes , kids are inherently curious or should be curious , designers too .
i &apos;m an old of house , so i &apos;m also involved in the subject of curiosity , and how does curiosity change our thinking , and why we might lose curiosity and so on .
this is a whole series of things that you &apos;re looking at in the actual end of the actual experience .
if professors get curious , they &apos;ll often be in the research research journal .
and that &apos;s what i had in the last half a year .
a research semester to the topic of nature design design .
now , you &apos;re going to ask yourself , why are you going to start the whole age of this natural archaic forms of communication , interaction and so on .
and i &apos;m just holding one of these little devices up because the things are always supposed to be more intuitive , always more natural , utilizing , and you have to look at what &apos;s really natural for us , of course .
and in front of the background , i found myself in the field of natural engineers design design , so the next generation in the human computer is working in the relationship of the human computer , how our tools or how the computer &apos;s computer is changing from the machine to the digital assistant .
so i &apos;ve been busy looking at when , of course , what or intuitively .
you may have to look at it again .
why does this happen at all ?
so , if we look at the evolution of our society , here &apos;s just showing you , we &apos;re going to move from third to the fourth generation , or social form .
so from the modern in the computer society .
each society is shaped by a primary medium .
in the beginning , the tribal society .
that means you &apos;ve found that you &apos;ve spoken a common language , you could communicate with each other , in the same cave , or in other areas , has developed cities or villages and has something like that .
but the primary medium was the language , something very natural , something very vital .
you also had to learn , so no child can talk about nature , but we &apos;re learning it , of course , sukzonal and atmospheric of course .
it was solved by the ancient society and the first form of abstraction .
that was a giant cry at the time , because of course you started to manifest the living language in the form of writing , which is what the liquid and living is , i &apos;m going to start it .
as i chel and when i chel and when i chel , of course , it &apos;s a very different narrative when it &apos;s a lifetime of itself .
but sukzonal , then , was the script as primary medium , got into it .
then the next generation , in which we actually have primary life .
this is just by pressure and print , with the theme berg and other .
at the time , it was just like a crime , where adel , creerus and others said , are you actually being insane when the people start reading , then they want to talk about it , and that &apos;s completely blown .
and now we come to the next generation , and the exciting thing is , as a universal shift , it &apos;s only a few hundred years , and we &apos;re right now in this phenomenal phase that we do this .
that confused us , of course , because we look at the one side that the new media , social media media , facebook usw and so on .
with the total transparency , which is the new thinking of what the old thinking is , don &apos;t tell you that in the lasagne horse meat and no beef or other phenomena , i just want to do it right now .
and these two worlds just put together , new and old thinking .
the exciting thing is , if you look at this , this new society , this computer society , it &apos;s very , very many mechanisms of mechanisms , principles and galvanaan thinking from the tribal society .
but now no longer on the local level , but on global scale .
we understood that the weather is global .
that the subject ecology is a global .
not , if i think local , and the neighbor is less organic , it doesn &apos;t work .
that means that the local village has become a global village with the same principles , of course , as intuitive , but also the total transparency .
as you knew back in the village , who has what happened to whom and when , this is what happens today about this expansion of self through these mobile devices .
it is that we know global locking and faster and faster and better .
this is how it happened to the village .
in front of the background , i &apos;ve been busy looking at what does it mean , which is , of course , what &apos;s going to happen for us , of course , what &apos;s going to happen for us , but what is the difference ?
because often , people can do it , they can &apos;t use it properly , so that everybody can deal with it .
so you have to deal with what that means , and not just change it , but it &apos;s going to be better .
and , of course , when , of course , something intuitive and how , as an age , i think it &apos;s going to take a sense of the things that they &apos;re doing , so that they &apos;re a test friendly , very intuitive , because then they &apos;re fun to use .
you &apos;re looking at it , as well as the study of the perception , and the perception of the perception .
and that is , of course , where you start and look and say , okay , now i &apos;m just looking inside the inner self .
and what does it look like in that ?
so how do we work when we look at it ?
and what does that mean actually , intuitive and how does our channels work and how does the cognitive process work ?
because steve jobs once have said , you need to relax to relax show it .
so you really have to look at the details , if i want to do something friendly or intuitive hand , which means that in the core .
and there you see , you know , you have a seven of our seven senses , most of us think we have only five , now it &apos;s even seven , because it comes in the near future , and it &apos;s also going to be in the near future .
and looking at how we process information , how do we take information ?
alone , what is information ?
information is every difference that matters .
many use the word , however , don &apos;t know what it means .
but i have to understand in the core , in the nature of understanding when information becomes information , when will we know information from data and information , so i know how to do things as intuitive or natural .
and , of course , design changes on perception .
we see this , if i act things , then i can make them confusing like on the right , where i don &apos;t know what &apos;s salt and pepper , or i can sort of make them intuitive by showing things .
so , a lot of natural , but in a flash , i see it directly where is salt and pepper in it .
and if i tell someone , i &apos;ll give you salt or pepper , then he &apos;s going to figure out what &apos;s inside the right .
and the left just intuitive access , and then hopefully , that no sugar is in it , the salt .
but also our perception itself , how it sucks us too .
for example , this perception in context .
the right circle is going to look bigger than the little , even though it &apos;s not the case , but it &apos;s very ubiquitous , and yet our perceptions , depending on where context we put things in .
anyone know what that is ?
come on .
marcel gould should work .
there &apos;s going to be some more to my glasses .
so it &apos;s a circle .
a second circle starts to associate certain similarities , or to associate .
and if i take a hold of halx , then we don &apos;t even see one unit , which is circle , circle and , but we see a unit , we don &apos;t see three parts , a circle , a circle .
this is what you call the adult law or the universe , which also affects us in perception .
it &apos;s important for the age of the age , which most of you in the first semester , the great act of law .
this is the close law of the continuity , acting law of the continuity and so on .
i often forget about the third .
but this is a essential part , if you want to make things equally intuitive .
the next phenomenon , which is very interesting , is the visual .
it sounds very banal , but it &apos;s very exciting when you get closer to it .
so we have the eyes in front of the eyes now , and now you think we &apos;re looking back at the back .
that &apos;s wrong .
you look at the front of the front .
because they &apos;re proposing an assumption to front that they see something they recognize , unprecedented circle .
that means we &apos;re looking at our vision , before we see it again , bringing back to the back in our sehedevice to say , okay .
i &apos;ve got this cognitive retreat , you &apos;ve got what you want to see .
and then that &apos;s where it comes back .
it goes back to the front , because the back doesn &apos;t go back to the front and say , well , actually , look at it , you know , go back and clear if that &apos;s what you see .
and then it goes back to the back and then it &apos;s actually just seen .
so a very , very exciting process , like certain things that happen , and in what &apos;s going on for milliseconds .
i don &apos;t know who you know of this picture .
there &apos;s exactly the same thing that i &apos;ve just described .
now , every one of these patterns is trying to see something .
i don &apos;t know who &apos;s going to see .
anybody see something special ?
a dalmatiner , right .
if i saw that , that &apos;s a dalmatiner in there , you know that .
you &apos;ll never forget it , because i &apos;ll show you where the seal is .
now you see the dalmatiner .
and further , you see it always .
that &apos;s what i &apos;ve been doing now , actually , that you don &apos;t actually see no more patterns in it , but i put it in a very short way , always to see this dog in this enworged picture .
and this is this projection of vision , restoring feedback .
now i know it , and now i &apos;m going to go ahead that i see the dalmatiner .
i see the dalmatiner .
so , very exciting processes that then , yes , gray , it &apos;s actually not , but here in this rogren crowd .
does anybody know what three seconds are ?
long , yeah .
that &apos;s our present .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as designers .
if i know a little bit about three seconds , until i sort of get out of the present loop , then i can rebridge very well at the time that i &apos;m doing it by doing someone with three seconds .
that &apos;s what it has to process for the present .
and then it goes into the past , and so i can rebridge very elegant times for example , if i know this phenomenon .
what takes eight milliseconds ?
yes , milliseconds .
also a very exciting phenomenon .
this is the time that you fall in love with .
that means warning , if you know this now , pay attention to who you look like for a long time , because i &apos;m not going to take a bite for what &apos;s going to happen .
and six milliseconds , a very exciting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the period of most perceptions that we have .
that is , this first impression happens in a forant fast speed , as we perceive things .
and as we see things , we look at what we &apos;re looking at , and how we &apos;re sort of dependent on our environment , so that we can think of it as well .
now , of course , the old people are not only concerned with the subject and neural processing or cognitive processing , but fundamental of course , with the subject of human object relationship .
so how does a human deal with things ?
there &apos;s product language that is practical , so formal aspects or formaesthetic aspects .
there are codes functions where i know exactly where i need to reach .
but , you know , there &apos;s also symbolic functions , why is there anybody like this for a little bit of reference , where doesn &apos;t really fit into anything , so horror money in money , even though it &apos;s not that practical ?
so , we &apos;re more at the symbolic level , which is what we &apos;re looking at as a vehicle of course .
back to my actual topic of natural patients , interface and the subject , of course , is uschai .
usstian always means how to get a certain goal to a certain goal , or how to get a user in a particular context that is effective , efficient and happier .
that &apos;s what &apos;s really the norm that says .
how can i make something friendly ?
i can use that directly , or i need to have a handbook manual , or i need to take care of it .
and less relaxed or user is it .
that i &apos;m just doing it differently and beautiful , doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s better handable .
you have to understand that too .
and if you &apos;re in part of the software that we &apos;ve just seen , you &apos;re going to understand why nine percent of our software &apos;s software is very intuitive , or not on ananance , which is so locked in a lot of more intuitive ways , or possibly , though , even more intuitive than the classic software .
in fact , intuitive literacy is not only an equivalent economic factor for apple , and it &apos;s more fundamental to success when i just want to make a difference in technology .
why ?
because in the rule of this new kind of user benefit , the natural bear in detroit is about five times faster in the average of our goal .
you have to imagine that if you do something of the classical sofcloth , five hours , and with this new kind of natural software just one hour .
that doesn &apos;t mean that you can probably go home four hours more home , but your employer , or somebody falls to you , as he &apos;s busy with the four hours .
but what i want to say is , of course , it &apos;s a critical improvement to us , but certain things .
if we go back to the field of software , here &apos;s the first sulline of interfaces that were very abstract where you needed months to deal with these systems .
then the next , which is now with &quot; fundamental neural model , &quot; or mental model like software eergonan , has worked , which is you have an idea of something that is metaphor , the metaphor of a desktop to make it useful .
so no longer zeroes and ones , or claws , but just a metaphor .
it made a lot more friendly , but it &apos;s also a lot better .
the next generation of the graphic literacy area works very much with behavior .
so , as a matter of age , i &apos;m much more likely to behave than that .
it &apos;s also a paradigm shift .
that the appearance of the appearance is always more important to the success of the success , right ?
and if i go back to this natural bear , interfaces , where i am by voice , by speech , by touch , by gesture , and no longer by mouse and cursor , things have to control things , then i &apos;m more quickly .
but that also leads me to the point , when will things become more intuitive ?
if you &apos;re going to be more intuitive , and then i have to put my little friend over here , and see what does this mean because of the cognition of cognition , when is it really some intuitive ?
and this is for us humans forever , when i have to think about it very little .
so , apparently he doesn &apos;t like to think , but it &apos;s very easy to adapt .
the less i think about it , the more intuitive it is .
and what does that mean for designers ?
that means that if we can see that we can transmit existing models of something else , for example , the metaphor , then i can do this as an age .
that means that i can actually transfer such an intuitive , human model on a software and make software more friendly .
so , of course , the question is , what is the most intuitive thing about humans and now i &apos;ve been telling you .
this is called the visceral model .
this is using every one of us and ozone is a shareonym , and it stands for guidance , selective , transfisment .
it makes everybody the whole time , but it makes it unconscious and it &apos;s sort of intuitive , or partly , instinctively .
the model is already shown in the womb and it &apos;s interesting , so it works worldwide in young and old , and it &apos;s used by us all the time without most people ever knew that this model is there .
in fact , it &apos;s going to be about 50 to seven thousand times from us to activity , so in sleep , you &apos;ve noticed that it &apos;s less often balanced than the day .
i can now stimulate this mental model model , selecting , rigid , integrated , transorganized in an interaction system .
and through that kind of transmission , like with the metaphor of the desticy , now it &apos;s not a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of an intermuster , one hand .
and this is on a higher eil of kindness than the transmission of a classic metaphor , which is the decoding .
and if i &apos;ve been wearing this , for example , in the overview of the overview , selective selection , as a choice , it comes up to me , and i can look at it in the details , and i can look at it in the details , and yes , it means that i can throw it somewhere or buy someone or shop .
and then i can arrange this .
i &apos;m trying to do this by an unprecedented .
now , everyone has been eating pies .
overview , i &apos;m sort of interacting with the object , again , zoom back out , zoom in .
i &apos;m going to get the whole view of the whole way , can now tell you , can you just show me all about chocolate .
and once you have an interface , what &apos;s more intuitive and much more natural .
because , because i can reach the things like the bits , touch can touch and come to me , is much more natural than if over hierarchical societies can make these things accessible .
imagination is more echo than fans , and with this sentence , i would like to close , a and again , also , designers have to think differently , to come to new solutions , and in this sense , thank you very much .
i want to help you with a very specific aspect of curiosity .
the first , if you &apos;re going to be a child as a child , as a baby , she &apos;s going to take care of what causes it , right ? and depending on whether your parents have allowed you to play more or less in the pottery , and the more , of course , your curiosity is drawn .
and curiosity doesn &apos;t learn .
that &apos;s why all of those are the ones that are curious , in fact , people who have a property that you can &apos;t learn .
i &apos;m now about this , basically , this whole environmental debate , global set , four years of clubpling , in quality .
and there &apos;s a central point here .
and it depends on phosphorus .
offer pee a chance .
every day you give the + net size of two gram phosphorus , and every day you have to take two gram phosphorus .
otherwise you can &apos;t have teeth .
you can &apos;t store energy .
you can &apos;t have bone .
we could only glive as a one-eyed mollus by the world &apos;s ocean .
if we don &apos;t do a phosphorus , we don &apos;t get to go .
and what &apos;s surprising is that we &apos;re dealing with something , which is actually what would be self-awareness , but not that much .
because everyone talks about energy , but no one talks about the phosphorus problem .
the phosphorus problem is much more critical .
we depend on two countries .
we only have for two years of phosphorus , and already now , through the phosphorus mining world , we &apos;ve been able to put much more uranium in the environment than in all nuclear plants .
in the last 20 years alone , five thousand tons of uranium in our fields have been distributed .
and that &apos;s what we take .
it makes leukemia in children .
and we think we would protect the environment if we &apos;re a little less harmful .
so , for example , the environment , running less car .
the environment , make less waste .
the environment , it takes less energy .
but that &apos;s not protection .
this is like i would say , sit your child , just three times five .
it &apos;s just a bit less destruction .
if we think about this from the cape to baa , our entire earth used to be a peaceful farm or later .
that &apos;s why you think about it .
and the most important thing is to look at the ground as well .
in the soil , over six percent of the carbon saved .
right now we &apos;re building corn and losing between 11 and 30 kilograms of 98 per hectper gallon , or on the square meter .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re losing on the ground about five times more than reformed .
we can of course look at the trash problem .
and everything is packaging or content .
in open stream , for example , at the dawn of garbage , there are wind percent of the garbage waste .
and because we &apos;re getting older , the wind gets bigger .
that &apos;s it all in the pre-axis .
yes ?
one baby needs about six and a half wind wind .
we could of course reduce this by 10 percent , but what does that matter ?
it &apos;s grown in china in a second .
that &apos;s completely trivial .
so the question is , how do we deal with these wind ?
here &apos;s the evidence by the way that men are not pigs .
i want to tell you .
because the phosphorus is emitted in the pigs about the commoning parts .
it &apos;s about the urine .
yeah .
so men can &apos;t be pigs .
because that &apos;s the case , right ?
traditionally we think in environmental debate , we &apos;re too many in the world .
and if you talk to people when you &apos;re talking to people , if you say it &apos;s better , you &apos;re not going to be there , you &apos;re going to be more subtle and hostile .
and so someone like al gore says , one of our great heroes , there &apos;s nothing more important than stabilize human population .
in israel you say , if you save a person rescue , save the earth .
here it says , the more you get , the better .
yeah .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
if you look at the ants , the weight of the ants on earth , then the ants weigh about four times more than we humans .
i could also take termites , but in the united states , no one would be able to see anything , even though they &apos;re vegetarian .
that means the ants weigh much more than we do .
and because they &apos;re physically working a lot harder than we and because they live only three to six months , they &apos;re in their weight , in the energy consumption , something that is 30 billion people .
that means we &apos;re not too many , we &apos;re too stupid , right ?
and where you see how far we &apos;re going to get away from what we really wanted to do , and how sad we are , we &apos;re at all in the world , you can see that for example , we &apos;re going to be able to have a program for example , for example , that you can have a program , right ?
you can only be carbon-neutral if you don &apos;t exist , right ?
the only way .
have you ever seen a carbon-neutral tree ?
yes ?
one ?
that means our whole intelligence means that we want to be a trees , right ?
yes ?
no tree is carbon neutral .
luckily not , yes ?
there &apos;s no population problems of trees .
there are still six billion trees in the amazon .
so , you &apos;ve heard about overpopulations of trees from trees ?
that means all of our intelligence means that we want to be a trees .
and where you see , even in something like demeter , the most rigorous bio-- yes , it doesn &apos;t allow our own metabolic products to go back .
every year we lose three million tons of phosphorus , which is really going to go back to circular .
and we are too many .
alone .
that &apos;s what we feel so guilty about the earth that we say . there is no organic landscape , no bioluminescence and not , no , no of all , that will allow us to go back to our own exconditions .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
we are too many .
it &apos;s safe to be less harmful , which oil consumption .
but where are we useful ?
we &apos;re trying to minimize our ecological footprint , but it &apos;s about having a big footprint that &apos;s useful .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but if it comes to the environment , it &apos;s the highest , right ?
nullemissions , yes ?
you can only have license missions if you &apos;re not there .
even if you shoot yourself , you would have emissions .
so you can &apos;t solve that at all .
we can do it differently .
we can get our nutrients back .
we &apos;re doing in brazil from where we get the nutrients back .
we can get in the same way that we can get nutrients back in agriculture .
we do it in china , for example , where we take it directly .
in china , one more evidence is that today , it &apos;s still honey , right ?
and in our western world , we were always too stupid to bring our nutrients back .
it means that the entire western civilizatale story is that the city is always being taken , but the farmers never returned .
so the cities had to grow more and more , because the farmers went into cities and the cities had to continue to catch their nutrients .
so all of the western rich is always expanding until the infrastructure doesn &apos;t get done , and then they &apos;re implosive .
yes ?
in china it was different .
you &apos;ve done a little bit of time about five or five years because you &apos;ve always been able to bring nutrients back .
even today , if you &apos;re invited to dinner in china , you would expect to eat as long as you keep the toilet .
because it &apos;s unfriendly to go and increase nutrients .
you &apos;ve got them to dinner it , not for food theft .
that means you can see in the internet , how you can get the nutrients back .
this is actually beautiful , if you do that , which is agriculture , biogas generates , on a hectter-land country with five miles of people in favelas , with a farmer , and they &apos;re waiting for the chickens and the timber and the vegetable and the timber and the timber and the timber .
and the great thing about this is that the crime rate in the favelas around about nine percent .
so we don &apos;t have to control the people to be very bad .
we can support them to be good .
this is , of course , high-tech agriculture , but the plants carry themselves .
the byproduct is clean water .
and they &apos;re designed by design that a farmer can just deliver .
that means that the criminals go back .
and none of these facilities , we &apos;ve built over a hundred and a half now in the last twenty years , none of these were ever done .
you could easily throw a liter of water , and then the plant would ruin over years .
it doesn &apos;t happen instead .
that means we don &apos;t have to control the people to be very bad .
we can support them to be good .
that means we need to get phosphorus back .
and by the way , if you want to do what you want to do , you write on , in germany , the best of all the events that are in frankry .
unfortunately , not in open stream , but maybe you can help a little bit of a help in it .
because the frankry plant could get the phosphorus back .
and that must go back .
we see that that phosphorus is really critical .
and we see it certainly works .
we &apos;ve been using over three years now .
the dutch government has explained , you &apos;re going to be the first country in the world , which is phosphorus .
but we need that overall .
you know , there are two countries who control almost 17 percent of the phosphorus population in the world .
there &apos;s a bunch of seals there .
these are six countries to control four percent of the oil supplies .
and the oil will replace us by other energy users .
but you cannot replace the phosphorus .
so it &apos;s not about making the existing a little less bad , but it &apos;s about doing something right .
and it &apos;s particularly questions about what the right thing is .
it &apos;s about efficiency , not efficiency .
in holland , of course you understand that easier because in holland , the country is built on flowers .
yes ?
imagine if , for example , your wife is sad when you get tired of it , and you come with 50 roses .
completely inefficient .
but even effective , yes ?
or take a liop pen .
a woman in germany eats about six pounds in her lifetime .
.
this isn &apos;t a lot of science , because because we don &apos;t know how much cool it &apos;s going to happen .
but a bright pen , even in this lighting , i can tell you , is completely inefficient , but even effective , right ?
one thing that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
this is not the resource efficiency , but efficiency .
questions about what &apos;s the right thing ?
not to burn a little bit better from the rundown mud , and to put it down and to lose all the materials on the ground , but first to ask , how do you do circular ground ?
imagine mozart efficient .
yes ?
if i invite you to dinner and say yes , there &apos;s a pill with open taste and a glass of water .
wonderful , &apos; ne ?
that &apos;s efficient .
everything that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
if you fall in love with somebody , efficient ?
yes ?
it means everything that matters in life is not about saving it , to avoid .
all the environmental debate .
we tell people , oh yes , you don &apos;t have an environmental mind in the south .
no , the throw is exactly the right thing , right ?
at each point , where you get away from , yes , you can live again .
but the wrong things .
if you remove the wrong things , you have a trash problem .
in the way we think north .
there &apos;s every pedestrian footprint there .
if you walk , yeah , everybody destroyed the floor .
because the soil is going to die the mosses , and the wind and the water will wash the ground away .
but if you &apos;re in italy , every foot footprint means that the water is longer in the meadow .
so , it &apos;s about creating a large footprint that becomes a wetlands .
not school management .
we &apos;re in germany .
yes ?
but if i ask you how to do it with your wife ?
what do you say ?
sustainable .
then i say , &quot; heart bite , yes ? &quot;
that &apos;s the map .
so not saving , give up , prevent .
every waste is nutrient .
and it &apos;s a lust , if you look at in italy , like the people in the high bow , and they kick it out of the car .
because you know , it &apos;s a funny process .
it &apos;s the form of re40s , yes ?
you can show , i was there .
but with the right design , please .
so , for example , we &apos;ve developed an ice pipe that &apos;s in space temperature .
you can kick away where you go and stand .
in two hours , they &apos;re building everywhere .
and it contains seeds of rare plants so that they &apos;re going to take away from the angle to biodiversity .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
so it &apos;s two cycles .
not all of them should be compotenable .
a television machine , or a washing machine , they &apos;re just using them .
just the things that wear , like sticks , like lightning , like braeibing , who must be like that , that they have to go to biological systems .
the things that are used only are going into technical systems .
but today we &apos;re only talking about the biological systems .
yes ?
for example , the sneaker , yes ?
very direct ad , not for the company puma per se , but that they &apos;re now helping this company to help make these products successfully .
because we don &apos;t do things more freely .
yes ?
so , if i invite you to lunch and say that &apos;s free from crochells , you can &apos;t help it .
no , we stuck what &apos;s inside .
positive .
so not like detox .
not poison in it .
it &apos;s all in it , it &apos;s useful .
these are the first shoes that you can put on the track of the day , and you can walk the rubber in biological orbit , right ?
everything about it is complacable .
and if it works to us , of course , we can do it for nike , for nike , for hennes and 84 and the whole texture industry .
and this is half of all the water problems in the world that are caused by the texture industry .
that &apos;s what they help with , ask questions about the people .
hey , puma , are you really serious ?
because they have already twice the protests already .
and i &apos;m not sure if they &apos;re really staying .
so , help me a little bit .
but it &apos;s .
yeah .
that &apos;s what &apos;s been presented .
this is .
we can do things like this now that if you go , if you go , you can go in biological transport .
technical transport is the same .
there &apos;s this direct rename system .
this is the first green pack , actually , which is made to go back into the circulation .
so , in every shop , you can get things back .
if you get to that , yes ?
do you remember the windmill still ?
in the moment , that &apos;s the waste .
all around this wind is around , almost .
in the countries where people are getting to money .
there we go on the depogers , but in the landscape , yes ?
if we change the plastic , so that he can go to biological systems , if we change the water storage , in the way that they can just go back to cell banks , they can go back to a baby in israel or in tunisia .
yes ?
and if you take these windules , you tear them , and the powder and the powder , to plant trees .
so the baby is carbon positive for the whole life , already from the beginning .
so , we don &apos;t need neutral neutral , we can be climate positive .
it &apos;s sort of a laparopoope print .
yes , sort of .
yes ?
we can do that .
we can reinvent everything again .
i started a institute .
now there are lots of people working there , and you can all be engaged .
there &apos;s a little bit of a mess to craddle on shock , where everyone can join .
so no longer saving , depending on , avoid , reduce , no school management , but intelligent waste .
does it make you curious ?
thank you .
the work of the interpreted .
music as a language .
in the description of what i &apos;m talking about , i wrote as interpretin , as a translator , so in english wortsmaker , understand .
interprets are members of the written notes in the music .
that as a translator , it &apos;s not just the word for word for the text in a different language , but also to understand the deeper sense of words and wortzus , it has to understand a meaningful translation , everyone who has to do it with strangeness .
now , from the german to english to translate to the english , more knowledge can require more knowledge , as if it comes to dix or even poetry .
but nonetheless , it &apos;s for laien , what we &apos;re doing with our music language .
as a witness of music , i first got the written notes .
you think that the composer is written in the notes exactly everything he was looking at .
in fact , the notes are very vague and unaccurate .
these notes are about the same , or inaccurate , as a verbal , as well , as it turns out , very carefully , a landscape .
because in this distribution of land , it &apos;s the smell of the flowers not smell to smell , the degree of the green , just to hear the way the windmill don &apos;t hear .
it means that the interpreter needs to have this unpleasant description of language language in another , which is listening , concrete , non-verbal music language .
today , i want to tell you what else i can do , which is , draw animals , still translate into a verbal language .
so basically a translation of translation .
so i prefer to do that all the way to german , because if i had to translate it into english , it would be equivalent to the translation of translation of translation .
so , the music works for me as much as spoken language .
the note made the notes of the letter of a script .
so it &apos;s not enough to read , read notes , and to press the piano on the piano or the right spot on a violin .
because that was just the letters you &apos;ve learned to paint .
the point of the letters is that you can only spot the language of it .
so for the learning process of music music , you need at least as long as spoken language .
so , there &apos;s also a repulsion , whether you &apos;re learning it for the use , only passive or you can talk to yourself until the musical native language .
the work of the interpreted starts similar to how a theater directors .
after first you &apos;ve chosen to play a piece of play , because you &apos;re excited about the emergence of the composition of comedy .
you collect information about the piece in the secondary literature .
you read in the letters , tathus , notes , or whether there are words , thoughts from composers themselves .
you studied the works that he used to write before and after .
you think about it .
the causes to write it .
how did he get upset ?
how did his life grow , how the society and the politics ?
that &apos;s all interested me .
you &apos;re thinking in this time by looking at contemporary images , or reading literature .
now , with time , you also have a rich knowledge to the composers that you play , and it &apos;s getting easier to think of it in it and feeling it .
the composer is always more to the friend you live with .
his cause to write the piece will always be more and more to my personal cause , to play it .
now , there &apos;s a lot of the notes that a lot of the coverage of the composer represents , but just a framework , i &apos;m now changing this framework to fill it back with meaning and meaning .
i &apos;ll say to my own words , what might be written between this framework .
i play what these sounds might have .
now for me and for the composers , and what they might mean for him today .
every tone , every phrase gets a sense of that , because i feel it myself because of my own personal life .
it has to be for me in this and now now , otherwise i can &apos;t convince my audience that this is my cause .
it &apos;s always a very happy concert , if i may have the experience , that i &apos;ve been working as long as i did in advance .
as you &apos;ve seen a happy new day , although always with the same ritual of life , there are breakfast , breakfast , to work , as well as i keep doing the same thing again .
i &apos;ve become a day older , the seasons change , my pulse comes down at night , in a concert hall , it takes longer that sound comes back home .
i &apos;m going to breathe the audience right now , consciously or consciously .
all that affects me and all that affects me as an experience of comedy .
it &apos;s also wonderful , when i &apos;m standing on the stage and we have the same wavelength .
then the same thing happens in a good , decent conversation .
you bring a new idea inside , and you &apos;ll get these answers with a reaction .
it &apos;s exciting , because then things that we haven &apos;t done so much , and what you can &apos;t do , too .
it makes great fun in making music , and as the audience has experienced , then how music communicates .
so every concert is another concert .
i will never play more like that at the moment .
i can &apos;t play like 20 years now .
and i &apos;m going to have more lifelife experience than i &apos;m going to have today , and that &apos;s why i &apos;m going to have a lot more of color in the music of music and emotions and emotion than today .
sure , i &apos;m going to get a few colorers out of the body , but to get new ones out of it .
have a nice example of this .
it was on a piano venture for music students at my beloved old teachers at my beloved teacher , professor jell ude , a well-known beethoven specialist , concert bike and long-year-old professor here in stuttgart .
unfortunately , i was a lot of too young , so that it was already made when i finally started studying .
but i was very lucky to see him very early , with three-10 years , and so i &apos;ve been to my high school time .
i was at seventh , when i went back to one of his courses , and i played the last of the four balms of chopin , a night .
he asked me , what was the answer of this ballet ?
it &apos;s such a gene tool .
and in my youth , i said , expectation .
there he was , and he said , &quot; so ?
it must be the difference .
because for me , she &apos;s memory .
he was over six .
well , at seventh , you just have dreams , but not a significant memories .
i play the play for every few years , and it has changed for me , even though no one has changed .
every time it &apos;s exciting , i &apos;ll be reading something new .
an example of a whole different area . monet has painted the brievles times .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but at various times , at different levels of light .
he translated the exoghts , as he saw , as he saw in this moment .
his personal impressions of the lost .
the x-maligue interpretation of a piece is this .
now , i &apos;m also older than the chopin age , as he wrote the piece .
he lived only nine years .
and it &apos;s important to me always to look at the notes , even though i mean , they memorize .
to hold len , right with the composers .
because the notes are the only connection to him .
especially when he died .
now how do you start talking about language of music ?
i said yes , you need for about the same time for spoken language .
often the music class is that you &apos;re just learning the notes .
you learn virtually first that you read before you just speak one word .
you learn to find the notes on the instrument .
if all the fingers in time and right is like it &apos;s in the notes , then they come out , they come out of notes that sound like music .
if that &apos;s happening for comfort , students will get the next hard piece .
it &apos;s hardly been talked about interpretation .
well , there &apos;s front presto , that &apos;s a rapid piece .
lento , slowly .
according to and leisecious signs , f and b , etc .
that &apos;s what most people know here .
but even though you &apos;re doing this , it &apos;s still a little bit technical .
and it &apos;s still not interpretation .
i wonder .
i wonder that you often forget something very fundamental .
because , in fact , to make music on the instrument , your musical musical and you should feel there before .
that &apos;s the singing .
a child who didn &apos;t learn that because it didn &apos;t have the parents , it will not do it by itself .
this is like learning learning .
it &apos;s necessary to have its own experiences and the idea of music to then think about another possibility , so over an instrument , to sound .
people who have never touched , they never felt immediately with their own body , as it is to form a sound .
a phrase with his own breath .
because the music bank is the extension of our body .
our vocal boxes to sing , our hands and feet .
so the hammerheads in the piano are the sequel of my fingers .
the tune out of the free-fly and the rhythm from the dance .
the geolode reported today is not managing music .
you don &apos;t need to make yourself more yourself if it becomes a boring .
no longer need to be a whistling whistle or singing .
every one of your own music is made , if you &apos;re constantly charged by the outside of music .
sure , there are some of you who say yes , but what do you do when i can &apos;t sing ?
the question i do , can &apos;t you sing , a , because they believe they can &apos;t sing ?
or b , because they didn &apos;t learn to sing ?
in either , it &apos;s not too late to begin to figure out if you can &apos;t , or learn how to do that , or learn how to make these little muscles that hire the vocal chords , right ?
that &apos;s what you can train .
or c , because you &apos;ve been accused of them , that they &apos;re inexable .
i wonder , how much more skilled was this diagnosis ?
you &apos;ve got a second , or third opinion , how do you get it beautiful today ?
or d , you don &apos;t like any music and you want to have nix to do that as well .
but what i would ask you , because music is a beautiful , communicative thing .
but maybe you can still agree with it .
well , you can see , all the cases , nobody has to be a dissection candidate .
but please don &apos;t say , i don &apos;t understand the classical music .
i can &apos;t say whether it &apos;s good or bad .
there i was , but surely you can say if you like it or not .
because i don &apos;t think it says somebody , i don &apos;t know if i can &apos;t cook because i can &apos;t cook .
so , you don &apos;t get rid of food , just because you can &apos;t cook .
so you don &apos;t have to rely on classical music because you don &apos;t have an instrument .
listen consciously to it , and say if it tastes you or not .
whether the music is too sweet to you or too sweet .
tell that what they feel .
now , over time , you have to spray and you want to have more spells there , or taste a difference .
why am i asking now from my audience that it &apos;s also actively listening ?
because the music is a language and a language is there to communicate .
a artwork you never look at has no force to act .
the food that was cooked by a chef or a chef has got to be eaten , and not only would be shaped or doing recipes .
so please listen if a music is played .
it &apos;s not just a nice cartoon paper .
if in one environment , where the adults are doing music , or at least active music , a child grows , then it &apos;s easy for a music teacher to ask questions , which color has yours ?
can you also play it in blue ?
and the child is playing after a memorial , instead of a red flower now .
and this sounds very different from before .
so that was the first start of a musical expression .
so the first step to an interpretation .
and what happens when you play a piece today that was written by a hundred , a hundred hundred or six hundred years ago ?
now , the instruments have continued to evolve .
there was actually no piano at all .
it was just not invented .
i think that the stream would have been thrilled if he had had the sound of the sound in modern modern lavies .
i can now have the soundlations of sound that would have had the stream to sound on the modern wing , which is a barocka cembalo .
by beethoven , you know that he &apos;s been hearing more than he had been deaf .
today , a modern orchestra is able to play everything , which is a orchestra from the back of the day as unplay .
that &apos;s why composers rely on us to reinvent the pieces again .
so you &apos;re going to hear what you &apos;re just looking at in mind .
and also , what you would think of in the spirit today .
or what i &apos;m talking about today , because what you might have thought about .
thank you .
you know what envy is ?
were you ever in envy ?
and how did it feel ?
cut .
i have a friend who drives a passerati .
and when i come , with my little v piesel , and i &apos;m wrong , this sense of feeling .
i &apos;ll shoot through the head .
i say , ultra-f , what do you need a big car ?
that &apos;s what &apos;s going on in the first year .
and at all , you work a lot less than me .
why do i have to afford a little car ?
and then i immediately think that &apos;s uneasy .
it &apos;s against justice .
and as i say the word justice , this is unpleasant feeling .
our organism has invented a great way to get these inpleasant feelings just like envy .
you can try that with words like revenge or profit or anything .
i want to explain to you this mechanism today , or get something close , which is likely to be familiar with you .
the mechanism comes out of the lie .
but don &apos;t think of the lie as you might have heard , if people say , nobody has the purpose to build a wall .
and then the rocks go back to the door to give them the perspective .
in such a lie , you see the liliself doesn &apos;t believe what he &apos;s saying .
it makes it easy to determine that it has very different in the sense .
he &apos;s just powering them and not themselves .
no , the lie i &apos;m talking about , which has to do with it , that they deceive themselves .
they need this lie to get a living lie , to get a self-delusion .
they can get them less easily , yes , check , or whatever .
you need time .
by this time , an anecdote you might be talking about .
the spanish painter pablo had a woman painted .
and this woman came up , the portrait would not look like her .
picasso says , just wait .
it &apos;s always going to show you .
at this point , when you laugh , you realize how important this lie is and how much time you need to experience something that artists can tell us very well .
because artists have a broken relationship to lie .
the artist teaches you something , and especially of this lady , what you don &apos;t see when you just look in the mirror .
the artist share you in a portrait of something you &apos;re going to be familiar with when you look at this artwork again .
then this unpleasant feeling , it may not look like you , and it will always be more like it .
here you have this mechanism that we can use the lie as a great invention to heal our lives .
and not only in art , in the folk people , in the mythology in which the mythology , in stories , comes back .
you may know this idea of the lady that every morning looked at the mirror and asked him who &apos;s the most beautiful in the country ?
one day , this mirrors says , yes , there &apos;s a beautiful .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
and you also know how much hostility from this true place , also the mirror can &apos;t lie , from this true place .
but we should just be familiar with the fact that you can &apos;t tell a woman that there &apos;s a beautiful somewhere somewhere else .
here it is necessary to get what we understand under laparocorrectness .
we need this particular lie that keeps us keeping the deception without we can &apos;t even live .
we don &apos;t just have in art , in the folk games , but in science such great lies .
and there &apos;s this story of the bischov of the bischester owner of worchester .
she heard about this book from charles darwin , the origin of the species and the elementary kingdom of man .
that the man would come from the monkey , and , yes , there would be a common ancestor between people and monkeys .
and then she ran it to her husband , and she said that &apos;s probably not true , which charles wrote .
the man is supposed to come off or have shared ancestors .
no , no , it &apos;s not .
and if it &apos;s true , then we have to prevent the people who get knowledge .
why do we prevent that people know about something , if it &apos;s true ?
because we cannot live without life lie .
because we have this self-deception , this sense of being great , from the highest creatures , not from such an evolutionary nature of something like this , from something that is uncalculated , such as an organism that exists to us , a rock and whatever things , that &apos;s unstoppable for us .
so , we can &apos;t read these things .
we need to prevent that people get knowledge from things , especially when they &apos;re true .
so you can see how slowly this mechanism is going to resolve and look like the traces that he leaves that lead to something else than on this great picture of ourselves , i want to bring you another story .
a particularly beautiful story , as i mean .
my wife told me it .
she came one day from school , she &apos;s a teacher , she told her about a student .
an autistic student .
she likes to do it especially because he &apos;s got an answer to the rise .
and she asked him , what are your robbys ?
and he says , well , i &apos;m at the fire department .
and because i &apos;m in the firemen , i &apos;m interested in parotech things .
yes , you feel it already when you &apos;re at that point . there &apos;s something wrong .
i told my wife , whenever a man in a moral legal system is using the benign because we should try and replace it by replacing it even though .
do that once and then you experience the sentence .
although i &apos;m in the firemen , i &apos;m interested in parotech things .
they feel that this is the real truth behind us .
so a little bub that doesn &apos;t really care about fire .
it &apos;s interested in the lighter .
but there &apos;s no one in which we can look at where you &apos;re learning how to make fire .
there &apos;s only the second best , just the firemen .
there he goes .
and over and over again , you don &apos;t tell his teacher that you like to put your muscle somewhere and be happy when the fire goes up .
no , it just looks much better if we show that we &apos;re in charge of the dangers , the other one only when you put fire .
here you have this little mechanism .
these evidence that in the foreign front of the bub knew that it &apos;s actually related to the fire , but that it can &apos;t say that loud .
here you have this clisting between the unconscious and the conscious , which is instantly hanging up , without you able to do something about it , and the things that you know , that you &apos;re going to look very different for you and others .
so these are just the words that we &apos;re starting to use in the language of the political speech that we &apos;re using .
in fact , we know something else is the case .
but we know when we &apos;re talking about this , the social sector is very sensitive .
we can &apos;t just do that .
it &apos;s impossible to do things like that in a society that should work .
i want to show you now what we found out in my institute .
after the logic of this deception , these self-deception , the willingness , a different reality as the ones that we actually know in the unconscious , that it &apos;s valid to spread outside .
i want to give you two , maybe three examples .
the first example is , what many of you know and some of you value , very few of you don &apos;t need at all .
i mean the soul .
what &apos;s the soul ?
the soul is kind of an intellectual thing , says about leibniz .
it &apos;s something that doesn &apos;t stop stop , material-nature .
and if you have people who are the most potent convictions that they have a soul , or you can also say that they &apos;ve been able to live from the soul to life , then think of it as if the soul is such an intellectual framework about you , it &apos;s not matter of matter , and it &apos;s kind of like the soul , you know , it &apos;s kind of an intellectual framework .
and from this soul , you &apos;re now thinking that somehow they &apos;re sort of in this cloudy nature , in this vector nature , called anima , in the latin , to be present .
and when this windththas is about the people , then it &apos;s filled with dignity , with nature , with nature that can only live , yes with soul .
and then he can walk out .
that &apos;s the idea of how the soul works .
so it &apos;s supposed to come from the outside to people .
so we should think of them as something that should be present for our lives .
and if you have this assumption in front of you , you understand the logic that we &apos;re fortunate to experience through a lie of our world .
because now you can apply a three-sentence .
they &apos;re still familiar with school .
this is now a three-sentence that describes an logic .
this is the hardest part of my talk by the way .
here you need some logic , but the willingness to lie .
and because of that , you can just make these logic wrong .
in this three-sentence , three sentences come .
the first sentence is , you know , there &apos;s no soul .
so the second sentence is , if salmon is right , it doesn &apos;t have a soul .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
i put it in particular .
a third set , which immediately appeared to people who have a strong sense of a soul .
they say who has no soul who is dead and can &apos;t claim anything .
and here you feel it .
here comes these logic in this , yes , this shame talk to expression .
you see it immediately .
the first two sentences , which are logical .
because i can say all of that .
the logic doesn &apos;t matter about reality .
i can say the canary is a man .
and if i have right , the canary is a man .
if i don &apos;t have it right , the canary is not a man .
the logic doesn &apos;t explain what is true .
i can say everything .
but the key thing is , if i &apos;m right , it &apos;s true .
so if creout says , there &apos;s no soul .
second , if he &apos;s right , he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
these things are logical .
and now our fake consciousness feels immediately , you can do something .
it &apos;s a third sentence that has nothing to do with the first two sentences , and it does as if the opposite of the first sentence has already proven and understandable .
because actually , we should have to prove whether there &apos;s a soul or not .
but with this logic that uses it simple , that two sentences are logical , and a third place is that it looks like it would have something to do so we can save our lives .
so , we &apos;re doing it as if it &apos;s really impossible to be without a soul .
and we &apos;re very happy about this .
we can do these things on different examples .
in the present , we have a very modern example of the day that keeps the daily newspapers .
here you have to have another philosophical subject , a permanent burning from philosophy , present .
it has to do with this that we go back into the fourth century .
there was a scholars who called johannes buridanus and after this is the buridanan esel .
the buridanan esel is an esel who is made of pure nature .
it doesn &apos;t have that soul .
that &apos;s a natural thing .
and if you put the exact same in the middle between two of the size harbor harbor , it &apos;s starved .
because he doesn &apos;t know which pile he &apos;s supposed to go to .
so he &apos;s right in the middle .
that &apos;s the nature of nature .
it &apos;s equivalent to the same amount of forces to add each other .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
only if you take another example , so if you &apos;re going to get the one set of representation right now , it doesn &apos;t need any reason and nothing .
he &apos;s automatically going to mind .
so if you have this idea that you &apos;re kind of driven in nature , it &apos;s going to be modified by the larger pile that immediately attract you , you also have the feeling that there &apos;s something like a free will .
and if we &apos;re too here in frankeen t , i remember the max plangraphy institute for brain research .
there &apos;s a scholars , which is called the wolf of the wolf , and it &apos;s telling him sometimes , wolf , there &apos;s no need freedom .
now we can form the second sentence and say , if wolf is right , he doesn &apos;t have any freedom .
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
and what we can read almost every day in the daily newspaper that you find in this third sentence .
it looks something like this , who doesn &apos;t have any welcome , can &apos;t be moved for his actions and claims to responsibility , and therefore it &apos;s disforced .
again , you have it again .
in fact , you would have to prove to see if there &apos;s something like welcome to it .
but the logic of deception allows us to do that as if the first sentence of pre-nnine is wrong to take the opposite without evidence .
and now you can just , if you want to do anything yourself , if you want to test anything , and most of all , if you want to make people happy , that courage to target .
so , for example , practice that , if you look at a person that you can then say , there are no previous ones .
and please don &apos;t use the german word for the previous word , which means the prophet .
you can &apos;t call that , that would be a little political again .
say there are no previous ones .
immediately , you &apos;re going to be able to find one , for granted , for granted that you can &apos;t prove .
and they have a problem .
because as you &apos;re busy , you realize that you can &apos;t prove that there are no previous ones , the man is very happy .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he deceived them .
because he led them to a ride he didn &apos;t stop himself .
because in fact , this man is not interested in evidence .
it &apos;s just interested in embracing yourself before the need to prove that there are predicted .
so , in the kind of transition of the evidence of the evidence , you get the genius of lie .
and once again , if you have an opportunity to feel that three-sentence in other people , they do it , because they &apos;re going to make them happy if they don &apos;t remember them in this way .
thank you for your attention .
yeah , good afternoon .
i gave myself lilly , if i could mention it .
she &apos;s one of the benefits of this great event , and she asked me if i gave a lecture and give me my idea of prize .
i &apos;ve got to say , you &apos;ve got it , you &apos;ve got to talk to me at the beginning .
and i may be able to imagine my map project that i &apos;m trying to imagine .
but , of course , it &apos;s the sum , lots of ideas .
i &apos;m probably , you know , the two nice girls still , i &apos;m probably one of the generation that &apos;s made for this bad oko image , because i &apos;ve started to study a hundred hundred hundred and a half pounds of machines in karlsthy , technical college , that &apos;s what i mean .
and i went back to berlin in the middle of the &apos; 80s , because i wanted to make renewable energy and i didn &apos;t have that in karlses .
there was the core research plant leopolar .
it was called all the kfa , the jewish shfa .
the hot ones today .
because a good engineer either has built great cars or nuclear power plants .
but something like &quot; n solar pendel , &quot; which is kind of a hundred watts out of the square square meter , which was a toy .
and in berlin , there was a crazy engineering collective .
i &apos;m grateful to be grateful , that he repairs the word again , because after the mouth , you didn &apos;t have to use the word anymore because everything was bad .
but that was not the case in the &apos; 90s .
there was the fact that there was an alternative alternative choice , and one of them was sitting in plain mountain , where you think of evil .
the life of terror , but it was called sheltronics , and it has made wind and sun , and i started in the middle of the 80s .
and yes , a lot of what was said today , it touched me very , very , very , many beautiful shapes that i &apos;ve lived through .
i &apos;ve spent 11 years in the collective that was base .
we were 20 people .
if one didn &apos;t say , you know , the coopcattle , which has a completely shattered . i &apos;ve got 10 years hard to do about whether i was a great engineering of engineering , perhaps , because of all the colleagues of my father &apos;s window .
it &apos;s related to wanting .
and that was really , very gently , and then you get in the stage , just showed this a picture on where i asked for 10 years , a thousand d mark , which was , in fact , the great one .
and i went up to six and a half of them , and then we have become the friends of the company with friends , which then came together with the spin-off beard of one cell manufacturer in the world .
a giant narrative story , but , of course , we have the problem of a growing company , and we then have two hundred and a half , a small group , decided that we &apos;re starting to start again and the next theme of the future , and that &apos;s what &apos;s called the next theme of the future , and that &apos;s what i think is going to be crazy to the fact that the people are going to say it &apos;s crazy .
and i brought you a project that i want to show you now .
and the title of the talk was , yes , how to get 100 percent renewable .
and we just started to wonder with a relatively basic crazy story , where you might have a memory of memory today .
on this island , this is the island graciosa on the azoren .
yeah , that &apos;s the data .
there are four thousand people .
they have an renewables today from five-10 percent .
and the question is , why don &apos;t they ?
that &apos;s simply not technological .
when you build more wind , the system starts to fail .
i &apos;m also telling you the politicians , if you &apos;re in berlin-adsershvon our facility .
they &apos;re always saying , why ?
we already have 20 percent in germany .
it can &apos;t be a problem .
but it &apos;s not true , we have seven percent in europe , and our net is physically the european .
if we had 20 percent , we would have the same problems that people have on this island there .
the question was just , you know , it was two thousand 2006 , the first contacts started with the island , but it just goes through .
as big as it would have to be such a battery , so you have to be an island on 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 , maybe even 17 percent renewable power .
and yeah , i &apos;ll go a slide back .
the conventional system looks like this all over the world .
by the way , about a hundred gigawatts of electrical output in the world .
that &apos;s the performance of a hundred nuclear power plants , because it &apos;s very fast everywhere .
the energy hunger of the world , which is going to happen , is being erased because you don &apos;t need permission .
that &apos;s fast .
you put it there .
and then it looks like this .
in the wake of three , three of them are always waiting for it .
yeah , this is what &apos;s going on down there .
we also get very precise data .
and the wind plant or the solar plant or whatever it is is in the rule of a brick system or a system that can only feed into small amounts here .
our goal was to just say , okay .
it &apos;s going to sit up and the wind , the sun uses the burden that they can form the larger percentage .
and if you want to go over 20 , 30 percent renewable energy , energy per year , not the performance at the moment , then you have to turn it off .
so , in the moment , you have to worry that renewables can take the whole network .
you can only see that , of course , if you &apos;re in some kind and some way here .
that &apos;s what nobody did in the world .
this is in the small style , so you can also use the car over a little bit of interaction .
people always ask me , what do they actually do in adhie ?
that &apos;s what happens .
but if you want to bring together a variety of these interaction , and you want to build a net , it becomes extremely complicated .
and our goal was , we wanted to go to seventh to nine percent renewable , and then there &apos;s this rest of the rest , the last decade , the last 10 , 20 percent renewable related , that will be very , very expensive and that will not work .
this is going to be a force of energy , which then , hydrogen , methane , power to gas , you know , it will be .
you &apos;ve got to go to a seasonal memory , and winter summer and not just the same night .
we just wanted to know what is a normal , tenky electrochemical battery .
how far do you get there ?
and then we did a whole bunch of simulations .
and the wind and the sun , and the load of the load , and came to the conclusion , a very exciting result that you have to go to the conventional system , which takes about 20 and a half cents a pound from about 50 cents a pound hour .
these were the very first calculations six years ago .
and then we said , okay .
it &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
we &apos;re cheaper like the gallup system , if the gallup price rises five percent a year .
and then we started to negotiate with the leviathan ones .
what would all be done ?
with investors , i &apos;ve been looking for a new pulse .
we were only five people to rebuild a society again .
and here &apos;s the representation .
the brown is sort of the conventional system , the green is our system .
that our system also has a slave , it &apos;s because we &apos;re going to do 20 percent with it , and also a price increase on the other things .
and the power-hindu , which is the electric business industry on the island , which is what we find .
we also want to support , but we don &apos;t believe you can solve the technical problem .
and that &apos;s why we decided to build a hall in berlin , in which we can sort of form the electric framework in the scale of the island one .
that &apos;s what we &apos;ve been looking for then to find the biggest battery in the world .
here it is .
it comes from asia , in the trap of japan .
and funny , it &apos;s in the &apos; 70s at the bbc at the bbc , now it &apos;s been developed , and it &apos;s been made up to the japanese .
you can see , it &apos;s a very , very large battery .
she has a megafold of performance , and she can bring it to six hours , and that &apos;s the battery that we have sort of simulated .
and then they set up .
we also have one of these gallup sulses in the same size , as he stands there in the hall to actually bring the full dynamic behavior of this network , so in the hall , this is what it looks like , there &apos;s the big battery in the back .
over here , we &apos;re going to simulate the whole transfer of communication system , the miles physics of the cable , to sort of make the vibration behavior in the net .
and here you can see the whole thing again .
we can also switch two hundred kilowatts of photovoltaics to the net .
here we see again that again , again , we &apos;ll see this , again , single , individual .
and what we &apos;ve done has been , since two thousand and a half nine , the hall was done , until today , for two hundred and a half dozen dozen , basically everything that was there between the individual system of electronics , we &apos;ve made .
so we &apos;re not a production manufacturer , but we &apos;re acting as a company that is only between the subject of battery and the web , and everything in between .
you have to communicate , of course , to communicate , you have to communicate into the net , and that &apos;s very complicated .
so the nice thing about this is that , in this island , you &apos;re actually able to take all the preprint in this island today that we will get when we want to increase our share of renewables .
so this whole discussion , as is going to go back and forth at the moment , energy shifting , how to go to the island , for example , in the island of five to 30 percent accuracy , so we discount the wind and the sun .
the natural light is going to be smart grid .
so , smart grid , a giant issue everywhere .
we &apos;ve been able to start on building electromobility on the island , asking questions , can you do the burden .
that means if you &apos;re at seventh percent renewable , you can &apos;t do that without memory .
you can go through &quot; n smart grid , &quot; you can do it by building nets , yes , that &apos;s what you should do in any case , but you &apos;re never going to be able to get up to memory .
and that &apos;s what the message is .
so a lot of people come and look at this , because you can see what the problems you get .
when we turn down the line , you don &apos;t have that rogue mass that causes a certain kind of commitment in the net .
and in fact , our european verbal grid is basically inherently sharp masses of big power plants , where the wave all around europe is spinning around europe .
we look in this network , and we see 50 hertz , and when it becomes nine hertz of comedy , we &apos;re going to start making a bunch of jokes , then we &apos;ll go back a little bit , then we &apos;ll go back up .
that &apos;s the system .
and of course , that &apos;s incredible .
if you tear that down somewhere , it takes a long time .
the hirshhorn is at least 10 seconds to keep the web stable .
and in time , they can react again .
if you don &apos;t have that , these robble mass , then you have to replace this with a technical electronics and electrochemistry .
and we can turn to this big battery two milliseconds a second .
and then you see what enormous speed of opportunity there is .
and the message is , we have to rely on these raw masses , if we kind of like our goals 20 , 20 , 20 percent , 20 , 30 , 30 percent and so on , if we want to reach at all .
then we have to break our must-run capacity in the net .
must-run is simply called the power station to keep the frequency .
yes , that &apos;s a huge debate right now , using the coal plant , because we don &apos;t otherwise , or gasturbines , because that &apos;s not happening .
and we &apos;re just trying to realize that you can make the capacity , the must-run capacity , can break down the electrochemical memory .
now , fortunately , there &apos;s a whole lot of studies .
and to this purpose , people then come and look at our studies , sort of , our island test .
and yes , the discussion is always about the question , how far can you take a piece of future there ?
and a lot of discussions that i had in the last six years were similar to the discussion that i had in the last 30 years in the last 30 years .
it &apos;s not , you know , weakness , child play stuff , we &apos;ve done everything we &apos;ve done .
we have an aging watt today in germany .
this is an alarming .
and i just go out of the fact that the next 30 years we &apos;re going to have the same capacity of electrochemical store all over the world .
simple , it will come .
there &apos;s going to be a whole bunch of disconceptions , and argue .
the nice thing is that i &apos;ve seen it in the last two years , that scientists are sitting on my side .
we &apos;ve got over 10 million of these projects now , and we &apos;ve got about 10 million megawatt-battery now on the german web .
this is going to happen in april april .
so , you know , you know , there &apos;s an idea that there &apos;s a change there , and it &apos;s just because of this disagreement , to the idea , a hundred percent renewable .
and if you have a hundred percent renewable , it &apos;s like a auckeye system .
there &apos;s always going to be a discussion that &apos;s always going to be tried in discussions , these cavilanans , who are doing it , who have a little net , that has to do with our verbal and nothing .
so the question is , if you don &apos;t make yourself completely independently from any of your fossil or uranium energy , you &apos;d like to get out of the world somewhere in the world , and then you &apos;re an island .
then they &apos;re only using what &apos;s on the sun and the wind where they live .
and this is a little bit of our vision of a reputation of energy , and i &apos;m also grateful to be grateful that they used to use solar energy .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing , and inwhile , the talk from the linguum to make a collective that you may be able to be a collective and use solar energy , here a little bit together .
and yes , i just want to encourage you , in the sense that you can be a little bit crazy , and you may have a vision .
and you really have to stay pretty tough , but i think it &apos;s happening .
thank you .
when steve lopez , colomnist , the los angeles times , went through the streets of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , an african-american woman , sympathy , rau , homeless , who played on a violin , who had only two strings .
many of you are going to know the story , because from steves , it became a book later , which was seducted , with robert fallney junior as steve lopez and jamie bachx as a kitanthony , who was at the juilliard canvatory , who was the double assistant of the juilliard .
nathaniel left yuilliard , a neural breakdown , and 30 years later , he lived as a homeless on the streets of skid row in the center of los angeles .
i recommend all of you reading the book , or looking at the movie , so that you don &apos;t just understand the wonderful connection between these two men , but how the music helped make it , and how it was the instrument , and how it was the instrument , and how it was the instrument , and how it was actually the instrument , and how it was a game .
i met mr. adson in 2008 , two years ago , in walt disney agra hall .
he just heard a demonstration of beethoven &apos;s first and fourter singing and came out of the stage to imagine .
he spoke in a very heimore and more social clay on yo-yo and hillary clinton , and what the dodgers would never do in the baseball world series , and this is all due to the final passage of the first frab in the last sentence of beethoven &apos;s fourth .
we came to talk to the music . and a few days later , i got an email in which nathaniel was interested in gpersonal lessons .
i &apos;ve got to mention that nathaniel had a medical treatment , because he was already treated with electric shocks and gunaans and handsers , a trauma that has been tracking his whole life .
so , as a result , he &apos;s now particularly vulnerable to these schizophrenic phases , and these are sometimes so bad , and he goes away in the streets of skid row , always that horror and the folsal of his own mind .
and in exactly such a lovely stage , nathaniel , when we started with our first student in walt disney clark hall , he had this insane blade in his eyes , and he was completely lost .
he talked about invisible court and smoke and how someone wanted to clap in your sleep .
i was afraid , not mine , but i was afraid that i could lose it in one of his state , and that i could destroy his relationship to the violin , if i started to talk about clay and arpegical , and other exciting forms of didactic gself-interest .
so i just started playing .
i played the first sentence of beethoven &apos;s poininconcert .
and while i was playing , i realized that in nathania &apos;s eyes was a complete change .
it was as if it was under the impact of a invisible doctor , a chemical reaction that was catalytic .
nathanization led to understanding , in a calm curiosity and courage .
and as through a miracle he took his violin , and he started playing some of the violations of violinconcerts , and then he asked me to play them : mendelsson , tjerikowine .
we started talking about music , started by bach , brams , brums and all the other bs , from bartk to esa pekca .
and i realized that he didn &apos;t only know a encyclopedia about music , but with her also a close personal relationship .
he talked about her with a passion and a understanding that i just know about my colleagues in los angeles .
by playing music , and talking about music , it was made out of this paranoid , confusion man , who had just moved through the streets of los angeles , a loving , well-educated , sophisticated , in juilliard .
music is medicine . music changes us .
for nathaniel , music is seelian health .
because the music allows him to transform his thoughts and delusions with his imagination and creativity in something real .
and so he waats his disposal .
i understood that this is the nature of art .
this is the reason why we make music : so we do something that is in all of us , deep inside , our emotions , through our artistic lens , through our creativity to reality .
and the reality of that expression is reaching us all , and it moves , inspired and united us .
so what nathaniel anfing did was bring it back to a community of friends .
the power of music brought it back into a family of music , who understood him , who understood his talent and gave him an eighth .
and i &apos;m always going to talk to nathaniel musicians , whether in walt disney pauling hall or skid row , because he reminds me why i &apos;m a musician .
thank you .
bruno giussani : thank you . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play a little bit that i &apos;ve failed to do the most unlikely thing .
i hope you &apos;ll forgive me .
so i have a lot of fish in my life .
i just loved two .
this first , that was more like a passionate monkey .
it was a beautiful fish , well-willing , good consistent , gettfully , a well-seller seller .
what a fish .
even better , he grew up in aquakulst after the highest standards of sustainability .
so you could feel , you know , sell him .
i had a relationship with this beauty about several months .
one day , the head of the company called , and i asked if i could carry in an event about the sustainability of the farm .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
so here was a company trying to solve what this unimaginable problem has become for our cooks , how do we keep fish on our chimpanzees ?
in the last 50 years , we &apos;ve signed the ocean as we &apos;ve covered forests .
it &apos;s hard to overrate the destruction .
ninety-eight percent of the big fish that we love , the tuna , the healing , the grax , the heavy fish , they &apos;re broken together .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
so , i think it &apos;s going to be safe or lazy , fishing , part of our future .
a lot of arguments about it . fishing equipment is the environment , most of them , and they &apos;re inefficient , let &apos;s take tuna . a big disadvantage .
he &apos;s got a feed from 15 to one .
that means 15 pounds of wild fish are necessary to get a pound tuna .
not very sustainable .
it doesn &apos;t taste very well .
so finally , there was a company trying to do it right .
i wanted to support them .
the day before the event , i called the ceo of public labor for the company .
let &apos;s call it him .
&quot; don &apos;t , &quot; i said , &quot; just to have the facts right , you &apos;re famous to build so far outside in the sea , that you don &apos;t contaminate the environment . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s true , &quot; he said , &quot; we are so far outside that the waste of waste is being distributed , not focused . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; we are basically a world .
this is the food supply of one-year , he said .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
refugee one , great .
&quot; go to one thing ? what do you care ? &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . put on .
and at this evening i was in bed , and i thought , &quot; what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so the next day i called , just before the event , don &apos;t go .
i said , &quot; do you know what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said he didn &apos;t know . he &apos;ll start asking .
well , i &apos;ve got a couple of people in the company . no one could give me a proper answer , until finally , with the biologist biologists .
let &apos;s do it as well .
&quot; don &apos;t , &quot; i said , &quot; what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some algae and some fish memees , and then he said , chicken hydrlets .
i said , &quot; chicken pellets ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , fethers , skin , bone flars , scrave and consumed . &quot;
i said , &quot; how much percent eeating is chicken ? &quot;
in the assumption , maybe two percent .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; do you know what &apos;s sustainable about eating chicken ? &quot;
there was a long pause in the line and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken in the world . &quot;
i loved this fish .
no , not because i &apos;m enjoying a self-intending and well-man .
i &apos;m actually .
no , i actually love miw from this fish , because , i swear to god , the fish after that conversation after chicken .
this second fish , which is a different kind of love story .
it &apos;s romantic art , the way you know your fish , the more you love your fish , the more you love the fish .
i first eaten him in a restaurant in southern spain .
a friend journalist had been talking about this fish for a long time .
it &apos;s kind of wasted .
he came up to the table with a bright , almost white white paint .
the chef cooked him .
stop .
and amazingly , he was still delicious .
who can taste a fish so well after being cooked ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can do it .
let &apos;s call him miguel . actually , he &apos;s called miguel .
and no , he didn &apos;t cook the fish , and he &apos;s not a chef . at least on the way that you and i understand .
he &apos;s a biologist in baya la palma .
this is a fish in the southern western corner of spain .
it &apos;s near the coins of the river guadalshevia .
until the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of argentine .
they were breeding carnicattle on what were essentially wetlands .
they did that by breaking the land off .
they built this complicated episode of channels , and they put water out of the country and out in the river .
well , they couldn &apos;t do that , they didn &apos;t work economically .
and environmentally it was a catastrophe .
it brought about 90 percent of the birds around what are a lot of birds .
and so 1982 , in 1982 , has bought a spanish company with environmental consciousness .
what did they do ?
they have the flow of the water vice .
they literally put the lever up .
instead of using the water , they use the channels to pull the water back .
they were crossing the channels .
they created a 11,000 acres of fishing -- barsh , sea , garnons , aal , aal , aal and his company , the ecological destruction , completely reverse .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like that .
they look at the horizon , which is a million miles away , and everything you &apos;re looking at is canminated channels and these density , volangular march .
i was not a long time ago with miguel .
he &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts charles darwin and a part of &quot; a crocodile to kiss . &quot;
okay ? so there we were , fighting through the wetlands , and i would spend clubs and swees , and i &apos;ve got maw to my knees , and miguel is keeping in a biology class .
here he picks up a rare rail .
now he mentioned the mineral needs of physical toplankton .
and here , here he is a pattern of bundes that reminds him of the production giraffe .
it turns out that miguel has spent the largest part of his career in the mikumi national park in africa .
i asked him how to become a fish experts like this .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish .
i &apos;m an expert for relationships . &quot;
and then it goes and down into more of the rare birds and algae and strange water plants .
and don &apos;t get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the biotic community , in the way .
it &apos;s great , but i was love .
and my head became weak about this piece of grim fish that i had at the end of the night .
so i interrupted him . i said , &quot; miguel , how does your fish taste so good ? &quot;
he pointed out the algae .
&quot; i know boy , the algae , the phytoplankton , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible .
but what food do you eat ?
how is the feed ? &quot;
now , he continued to tell me that it &apos;s such a rich system that the fish would eat , what would they eat in the wild .
the vegetable biomass , the phytoplankton , the zooplankton , that &apos;s what feeds the fish .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely self-evident .
there is no food .
depending on a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals ?
later the day i went to this site with miguel , and i asked him , i said , &quot; for a place that seems to be so natural , &quot; different than any farm i &apos;ve ever been . &quot;
in the moment , it was like a movie director would have appreciated a stage .
and we bow around the corner and we offered the most incredible sight , thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of pinker goes through the eye .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at your bbs , pink .
they &apos;re poorer . &quot;
bad ? i was completely confused .
i said , &quot; miguel , you don &apos;t get your fish ? &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and fishing eggs to birds .
well , last year , there were 600,000 birds , more than 250 different species .
it &apos;s become the largest and one of the most important private bird reserves in europe .
i said , &quot; miguel , is a good good bird , not the last thing you want to have on a fish ? &quot;
he sat his head , no .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re going to rebuild , not intense .
this is an ecological network .
the flries eat the shrimp .
the shrimp eats the physical toplankton .
so the balance the gut , the better the system . &quot;
okay , let &apos;s rethink that . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed your animals and a farm that measures your success on health of your predators .
a fish , but also a bird reserve .
oh , and by the way , they don &apos;t even have to be there .
they breed in a city of 10 miles away where the land is better for the nest maintenance maintenance workers .
every morning they fly for 240 miles a farm .
and every night they go back 240 kilometers .
they do that because they can follow the white line of the land street .
seriously .
i introduced a kind of a journey of penguins , so i looked at miguel .
i said , &quot; miguel , are you going to fly 240 miles to the farm and then you fly 240 miles away ?
do you do that for the kids ? &quot;
he looked at me as if i was a song of whitney houston quoting .
he said , &quot; no . you do that because the food is better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my beloved fish , which was delicious , and i don &apos;t like fish skin . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it .
it &apos;s this gathering , folded taste .
i almost never cook with it .
and yet , when i tried to put her in the southwest in southern spain , she didn &apos;t do it at all .
she tasted sweet , and she was going to take a bite from the ocean .
i mentioned this to miguel and he was laughing .
he said , &quot; the skin works like a sponge .
it &apos;s the last resort , before something goes into the body .
it &apos;s evolved in evolution in order to go in and down . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; but our water has no inert . &quot;
okay . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed your fish , a farm that measures your success to success .
and then i realized , if he said a farm that doesn &apos;t have an inert , he &apos;s going to be enormous , because the water that comes through this farm comes from the river of guadalshevia .
it &apos;s a river that leads all the things that are happening to the rivers today , and they tend to lead to chemical pollutants .
and if it &apos;s been fought by the system , and this leaves the water , it &apos;s cleaner than it is .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s drinking water .
so not just a farm that feeds their animals not just a farm , not just a farm that measures their success on health of their predators , but a farm that literally is a water plant , and not only for you and me .
because when the water flows out , it goes down in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;m going to take it , and that &apos;s what you should do , because these love story , as romantic as romantic is always .
you might say that she is a recipe for the future of good food , whether we &apos;re talking about barsh or meat .
what we need now is a radically new concept of agriculture , from one , in which food actually tastes well .
but for many people , it &apos;s a little bit radical .
we &apos;re not a realistic , we enjoy it . we &apos;re lovers .
we love farmers . we love little family businesses . we talk about local food . we eat organic .
and if you say that these are the things that are the future of good food , someone somewhere in somewhere and says , &quot; hey people , i love pink flries , but how are they going to feed the world ?
how will they feed the world ? &quot;
can i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like this question .
no , not because we already produce enough calories to feed the world more than only to feed .
one billion people are starving today .
one billion -- this is more than ever before -- because of cruasans in the distribution , not the overall production .
now , i don &apos;t like this question because it &apos;s the logic of our food system , the last 50 years .
the grain grain of plants of plants , polluting of monocultures , chemicals on the earth , chicken on fish , and all the time , the agricultural industry just said , &quot; if we feed more people cheaper , how awful can it be ? &quot;
that was the source . it was the legal industry . it was the american business plan .
we should call them what it is , a industry in ablaughter , a industry , which is rapidly ecological capital , which allows this production .
it &apos;s not a industry , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
our chamber is now threatened , not due to disposal , but because of the resources of resources .
not through the latest tail , and tractor inventions , but by fertility land , not by pumps , but by fresh water , not by traffic , but through the forests , it &apos;s not by fishing and networks , but through fish in the sea .
they want to feed the world ?
let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that enable every community to feed themselves ?
to do that , don &apos;t look at the agra-industrial model for the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
capital , chemistry and machines are in there , and it has never really produced good to eat .
let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
this is what reaches on two billion years of labor .
look at miguel , farmers like miguel .
businesses , they don &apos;t have any worlds for themselves , businesses , who are recreating rather , rather than need to do business , rather than just a lot of them , farmers who are not only produced but experts for relationships .
because they are the ones who are experts too .
and if i &apos;m really honest , you &apos;re a better chef than i am ever going to be .
you know , i &apos;m right , because if that &apos;s the future good food , it will be delicious .
thank you .
if i want to get to you one thing today , it &apos;s that the overall data that we consume is bigger than the sum of its parts and instead of thinking about information processing , i think it &apos;s going to be thinking about how we can use information that &apos;s otherwise not visible .
so , what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical mortality diagram after age .
the program i use here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called pivot and what i can do with pivot is that i can filter to a certain cause of death , say accidents .
and i immediately see another pattern that makes it .
and that &apos;s because in the middle area , people are the most active and they &apos;re over here at the most critical .
we can take a step further and then arrange the data then and see that repeated disease and cancer is the normal suspects , but not for everyone .
now , if we move on and after age , we &apos;re going to see 40 years or younger , and we &apos;ll see that accidents are even the main cause of the people .
and who &apos;s going to look at research that &apos;s especially true to men .
so you can see that looking at information and data in this way is reminded about swimming in a living information graph .
and if we can do this for raw data , why not have content itself ?
now what we have here is the cover of every single sports illustrator , which has ever been printed .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
you can like to test it in your rooms .
with pivot , you can dive into a decade .
you can be immersed in a particular year .
you can jump directly into a specific copy .
now , if i look here , i see the athletes that appear in this copy and the sporting species .
i &apos;m a lance armstrong , so i &apos;m going to show you what i &apos;m all spending on all expence in the lance armstrong .
now , if i just want to get a more mulchy view , i could think , &quot; ok , what if i look at everything with the subject ? &quot;
so i &apos;m going to step back and further the perspective .
now i see greg lemond .
and so you get an idea of that , that if you look through this kind of information , regulating , broader , pure , zoom out , you don &apos;t seek or surf just .
you do something that &apos;s actually a bit different .
it &apos;s something in between and we think it can be used the way information can be used .
now i want to take this idea a little bit about what a little bit crazy .
what we &apos;ve done here is we &apos;ve taken every single one of the wikipedia and reduce it into a little summary .
the summary contains a short overview and a symbol for the area that comes from .
i &apos;ll just show you the top 500 of the popular tedtalks .
but even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things .
we immediately get a sense of the themes that are on the most popular .
i &apos;m going to give you the government government .
well , after i chose the government , i know that the wikipedia is changing , which is the most of the time magazine .
this is really important because this is an insight that &apos;s not in a single wikipedia .
that &apos;s just to see if you step back and look at the whole .
so , looking at a particular of these summaries , i can then go into the theme time &quot; people of the year , &quot; and all together .
now , if i look at all these people , i realize the majority of them are government officers . some of them come from science . some , less , come from the economy . here &apos;s my boss . and one comes from the music sector .
and interestingly , bono is a ted prize .
so we can jump and look at all the ted prize winners .
you can see , we surfing the net for the first time as if it &apos;s really a web , not just page , but much more abstract .
and so i want to show you what a little surprise might be .
i &apos;m just showing you the new york times website .
pivot , this application -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not a browser , but you can look at websites with it -- and we &apos;ll bring it to the technology .
so i can step back , and directly jump to a specific sea jump .
so this is important because you just look through the study of websites in this kind of way , and look at the whole internet course in the same way .
so i can zoom in in my course in a certain time frame .
here &apos;s the entire demonstration of the entire demonstration i &apos;ve been holding .
and i can sort of get everything i &apos;ve been looking at today .
and , again , if i took one step back and look at everything , i may be able to rearrange my course , maybe after my search past . here , i looked at &quot; nepotistic , &quot; here , after bing , right here .
and from here i can go into the site and bring it back to it .
it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s used over and over again , and every time it gets to the sum of the files .
right now , in this world , we think that data is a flight .
we talk about the flow of information .
we &apos;re talking about drowning in information .
what if we could flip this situation and put the internet on the head so that instead of always going from one to another to go from many things to a lot of things , we can go from many things to be able to happen .
if we can do this , then this past data trap , maybe a new source of information .
and , instead of just moving into information , we can get knowledge from it .
and if we know , maybe we can even get rid of them .
i &apos;m listening to that , thank you very much .
i grew up with a specialist of science fiction .
in my school time , i went to school with the bus to school every day .
and my nose would always put in a book , a science fiction book , which is my mind in other worlds , and in the way my deep way to my deep , insatied curiosity .
these curiosity also showed that i was always in school when i wasn &apos;t in school , and i went through the forests , and they went , &quot; samples , frogs and snakes and beetles , &quot; and it was looking at the microscope .
i was completely thrilled , you know .
it was always about trying to figure out the world and explore the boundaries of the possible .
and my love to science fiction appeared in my environment , because at the time , in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and studied the deep sea .
jacques cousteau came into our living rooms with his fascinating shows that showed us animals and places and a world of wonder that we &apos;ve never imagined before .
well , that &apos;s really good for the science fiction to do that .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and since it doesn &apos;t have video games nor video games , they still had the whole imagery in the media landscape , i had to create the images in my head .
we had to do that at the time . when we read a book , we took the description of the aualia and we put it on the screen in our heads .
my response to that was drawing and painting from aliens , alien worlds , robots , space ships and all this .
in math class , i was always caught by the teacher as i was hiding , hiding around .
creativity had to be somehow out .
and something interesting happened . because what i was fascinated with is jacques cousteaus &apos;s shows , was the thought of a completely unknown world on earth .
i certainly would never have an alien world with a spaceship . it seemed quite unlikely to me .
but here was a world that i was actually able to enter here on earth , and it was just as fascinating and exotic as all of the things i &apos;ve always imagined when i read these books .
so i decided when i was 15 , diver .
the only problem was that i lived in a small village in canada , a mile from the next ocean .
and i didn &apos;t let myself cry .
i cheked my father until finally he had a dive school in buffalo , new york , made out of the other side of the border where we lived .
i made my dive in a pool of the charca in the middle of the winter in buffalo new york .
but the ocean , the real ocean , i only got two years later to face when we moved to california .
since then , in 40 years , i have spent about 10,000 hours of water spent under water . 500 hours of it in submerboats .
and i learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the flat oceans , is as rich as we can &apos;t possibly imagine .
the imagination of nature doesn &apos;t know boundaries , unlike our own , portable human imagination .
until today , i feel deep awe for what i see on my dive .
and my love to the ocean is holding , with the same intensity as ever .
when i first looked at a career , it was the filmmaking .
that seemed to be the best way to tell my inner drive , my stories , to create images , to unite .
as a child , i drew constantly comic books and so forth .
so these were the lanes of the road , images and stories combined .
of course , the stories i looked for was out of science fiction , &quot; terminator , &quot; &quot; aliens , &quot; and &quot; abyss . &quot;
in &quot; abyss , &quot; i could get my prelove for the underwater world and come to the filmmaker .
so , basically , my two passions .
something interesting happened at the &quot; abyss &quot; : to solve a narrative problem in this movie -- and that &apos;s what we had to create a kind of liquid water -- we went into computer generated animation , and cg , back .
what came out of this was the first computer surgenerated figure that was ever seen in a movie .
the film didn &apos;t make any money , frankly , he just played his production costs , but i noticed something fascinating : the audience around the world was like conanimate the magic that went out of it .
according to arthur clarke &apos;s law , most advanced technology and magic is not different from each other .
so they saw something magical .
and i found that incredibly exciting .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that must be involved in the movie art . &quot;
so we went to &quot; terminator 2 , &quot; my next film , even more .
together with ilm , we made the guys out of liquid metal . success was all about how this effect would come .
and it worked . again , we had created a bit magical , and the effect in the audience was the same . but we &apos;ve played a little bit more money with the film .
from these two experiences , a whole new world was achieved , a whole new world of creativity for film .
so , i started a company with my good friend of stan winston , who was at the time at the top of the best mags and creatuation designers . she called &quot; digital pauling . &quot;
the idea of this company was , the phase of analog processes with visual printing , etc .
and we then did a competition that we did .
but in the middle of the 1990s , we found that we were in the creatuation and the ganges design -- which we actually started the company -- to slow forward .
i wrote this piece of &quot; avatar &quot; written in a little bit of visual effects and computer-generated effects in whole new heights , with realistic human characters , which were increasingly produced by cg , and the main figures should be made .
but the slope of it was pretty back , and people in my company told me that we weren &apos;t going to be able to be able to do that .
so i shifted this , and i made this other film about the big ship that goes on .
the movie studio , i &apos;ve sold this as &quot; romeo and julia on a ship , &quot; it became a love movie , a passionate film .
but i really wanted to dive down to the actual killer of the titanic .
so i made the film .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know that .
but i &apos;ve convinced you , by saying , &quot; we &apos;re going to go to the wck . we &apos;re doing the real thing .
we &apos;re going to show it in the opening sequence of the film .
this is hugely important . it &apos;s a good thing for marketing . &quot;
and i talked to them to finance an expedition .
sounds crazy . but again , it goes back to that your imagination can make reality .
we actually created six months later a reality where i found myself in a russian dive boat , four miles under the surface of the north atlantic , and i looked at the real titanic through a sweateye .
that wasn &apos;t a movie , no hd , that was real .
so , that really struck me .
and the preparation for this were enormous . we had to build cameras and light and everything .
and i noticed how much these deep sea walks , a space mission similar .
well , they were also highly technically , and they were allowed to have a huge spread .
you go up into these capsule , you &apos;re floating into these dark , hostile environments , where no hope is on saving , if you don &apos;t get it back .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s just as if i was in a science fiction film .
it &apos;s really cool . &quot;
i was really obsessed with studying the deep sea .
anyway , by the part of the piece of curiosity and science . it was all . it was adventure , it was curiosity . it was imagination .
and it was an experience that hollywood couldn &apos;t give me .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature that we could create a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i was going to see outside the window .
in some of the following expeditions , i saw creatures in thermalwells , and sometimes things that i had never seen before , sometimes things that didn &apos;t even have seen before , and for the science , when we saw it , even no words .
so that really blew me up , and i wanted to .
and so i met a slightly unusual decision .
after the &quot; titanic &quot; i said to myself , &quot; okay , i want to put my career as a filmmaker in hollywood , and for a while , researchers . &quot;
and then we started up to the bismarck , and we explored them with robotic witness .
we went back to the titanic of the titanic .
we took little robots that we built , which was a fiberglass cable .
our intent was to come inside and see the inside of the ship , which has never been done before .
no one had ever explored the inside of the stick . you didn &apos;t have any means . so we developed the technology .
well , i &apos;m sitting here , on the deck of the titanic , in a dive boat , and see planches that are quite similar to these boards and i know that the band has played there .
and i fly with a little robotic experience through the course of the ship .
it &apos;s actually just , but my consciousness is within the vehicle .
it felt like i was physically within the ship of the titanic .
this was the most surreal form of a déjire vu , which i &apos;ve ever experienced , because before i get to a corner of bog , i always knew what was going to show up in the light of the vehicle , because i ran the film .
so the set was a very accurate copy of the ship of the ship .
so that was a very strange experience .
it made me realize this teleprested experience that you use such robotic directors and so your consciousness in the vehicle can transform into these other forms of existence .
it was really profound .
and maybe a little bit of what might happen in a few decades , if you have humps body to explore something or to do other things , in all kinds of post-human future courses that i can imagine as science fiction .
so , after these expeditions , we began to see what we were looking at down there , for example , the deep sea , where we saw these incredibly intriguing animals , which are kind of alien , but here on earth .
they live with chemosynthesis .
they don &apos;t exist in a sunlight based on sunlight , like we do .
and so you see animals that are right next to 500 degrees centigrade that they can survive there .
at the same time i was also interested in space science , which was again the science fiction of my childhood .
and so i ended up with the people who are interested in space and who have to do with nasa , and in the nasa &apos;s future , and design the right space commission . they drive to russia , going through the mission of the biomedical installation , taking it to the international space station and take it to the international space systems .
that was fascinating .
but the end of it was that i took space scientist to the deep sea .
i took them with them , and they gave them access to the world at the bottom : astrobiologists , planetary scientists , people who were interested in such extreme circumstances , i took them to take samples and test instruments , and so on .
we turned into documentary movies , but actually , science , more frankly , said space science .
this is how the circle of my existence was as a science fiction , as a child , and the creation in the reality .
in the course of discovery journey , i learned a lot .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science , but i &apos;m certainly thinking , you know , a director needs to lead , a leader , as a ship or a ship .
but i didn &apos;t understand much about leadership before i joined these expeditions .
because at a certain point , i had to say , &quot; what do i actually do here ?
why do i do that ? what &apos;s coming out ? &quot;
these stupid films don &apos;t bring us any money .
we just play the cost of production , by fame not .
everybody &apos;s thinking i &apos;d gone between &quot; titanic &quot; and &quot; avatar , &quot; and i would have taken the nails somewhere on a towel on the beach .
i &apos;ve made all these films , these documentary films , for a very small audience .
no glory , no excuse , no money . what are you doing ?
you make it about the will to get the challenge to the challenge -- and the ocean is the most challenging environment that you have . you &apos;re doing it because of the discovery , and because of a small group of people creating a team .
because we &apos;ve done all this with only 10 to 12 people who have been working for years , sometimes we were two to three months back to each other .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing is that the most important thing you have in front of each other is because you have a task that you can &apos;t explain anything else .
if you go back to land , and you say , &quot; we had to do it , the fiberglass , the sound of the sound , and the whole technology , the whole technology , and the difficulty , the human performance , that you can &apos;t explain . that &apos;s how you can &apos;t explain the other .
there &apos;s a connection that creates mutual respect .
so when i go back to my next film , &quot; avatar , &quot; i tried to use the same kind of leadership , which is that you can respect your team and respect it .
so , the dynamic really changed .
so i came back with a little team of unfamiliar terrain . we made &quot; avatar &quot; with a new technology that didn &apos;t exist before .
incredibly exciting .
an enormous challenge .
and we became a right family for a five-year family .
it changed my way to make films , completely .
there were people who said we &apos;d actually done this ocean bias , and on the planet pandora .
for me , it was more fundamental to doing my job to do the actual process that has changed in the outcome .
so what can we do from all this ?
what are lessons we learned ?
i think the first point is curiosity .
it &apos;s the most powerful human quality .
our imagination is a force that can even create reality .
and the warning of your team is more important than the lorilla of this world .
to me , young filmmakers who say , &quot; give me a piece of advice like that . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t restrict yourself .
that &apos;s what others get for you . don &apos;t do it yourself , don &apos;t bet yourself , but take risks on you . &quot;
nasa has such a photograph : &quot; failure is not an alternative . &quot;
but in the art and studying failure , failure has to be an alternative , because there is a trust .
not an important endeavor , the innovation responded , was ever addressed .
you have to be ready to take risks like that .
that &apos;s the thought that i &apos;d like to leave you with on the way . failure is absolutely an alternative , but fear is not . thank you .
today i &apos;m going to talk to you about energy and climate .
and this may surprise you , because my full-time work at the foundation is mainly about vaccines and seeds that are good at the things that we need to invent and to deliver the poorest 2 billion a better life .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , actually more important than anyone else on the planet .
climate change means that your mom is not going to grow over many years . it &apos;s too much or too little rain . things are going to change like it cannot separate their fragile environment .
that leads to hunger . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to uncertainty .
so , climate change will be terrible for you .
also , energy epic is very important for you .
in fact , if you could only reduce the price of one thing , the poverty reduction would be far at the most effective time .
well , energy epic is over time .
in fact , the progress society is based on energy advances .
the cohlal evolution , the industrial revolution , gave the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a very rapid case in electrical rice and therefore we have refrigerators , climate change , we can make modern materials and do things .
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but , if we reduce the price -- let &apos;s get rid of the price of halval -- let &apos;s go to a new barrier and this barrier .
co2 prices and the equation is actually quite clear .
they pollinate that carbon dioxide , which leads to the temperature increases and has some very negative consequences . effects on the weather and maybe worse , the indirect consequence that the natural ecosystems can &apos;t adapt to these rapid changes , and so on .
now , the exscening relationship between a carbon increase and by measuring temperature change and where the other consequences are , there are some unthinties , but not very many .
and there &apos;s certainly uncertainty about how bad these consequences are going to be , but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad !
i &apos;ve asked the top scientists to say , &quot; do we really need to go down to zero ?
does it cost half or a quarter ? &quot;
the answer is , until we get close zero , the temperature will continue .
so it &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different from saying , we have a three-and-a-half foot truck , which has to go under a three-foot bridge , and you can sort of fit it underneath .
it &apos;s got to go down to zero .
well , we get a lot of carbon dioxide out every year , over 26 billion tons .
every americans about 20 tons . people from poor countries , less than one .
on average , it &apos;s about five tons of everybody on the planet .
and somehow we have to make changes that go down to zero .
it &apos;s been constantly balanced .
only different economic changes have changed at all , and we need to move from rapid rise to the rise to zero .
this equation has four factors , a little multiillusionation . you have this thing on the left -- co2 , which you want to make zero , and that will depend on the number of people who are using the average of every person on average , the average energy consumption of every service , the average energy unit .
so let &apos;s take a look at each factor and think of how we get it to zero .
probably one of these numbers has to come close to zero .
now this is basic algebra , but let &apos;s go through it .
we first have the population .
today , 6.8 billion people live .
and it goes to 9 billion . it &apos;s to move to nine billion .
if we &apos;re very successful with new vaccine , the health care and reproduction of medicine , we would probably reduce that to 10 percent to 15 percent , but now we see a slope around 1.3 .
the second factor is the services we use .
it involves all the food that we eat , clothing , television , heating .
these are very good things and poverty reduction , which means that almost every one on the planet is able to do that .
it &apos;s great that this number goes up .
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we might be able to do and use less use , but on average , that number is going to increase every year and so on , which is the number of services that are being put in .
here we see a very basic service . is there any way home , so you can read the homework ?
and these students don &apos;t have it , so they go out and read their school assignments under the street .
now , efficiency , the e , the energy per service , is finally good news .
we have something that doesn &apos;t rise .
because of different successes in the light sector , through other oyds , through new methods , there &apos;s a lot of services in the building building , there are many services that make some of the services that are reduced to 90 percent .
in other services , like making fertilizers , 105 : 05 : 56,000 -- 7.5 : 7.5 : 55 , or air traffic , is a lot of the game for improvement .
in total , if we &apos;re optimistic , maybe we &apos;ll get a reduction between three or maybe a factor six .
but in the first three factors , we &apos;ve gone from 26 billion to maybe the best 13 billion tons , and that &apos;s not enough .
so let &apos;s take a look at the fourth factor -- and this is going to be a key factor -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 that causes energy consumption .
it turns out that you can get it to zero .
if you burn coal , no .
if you burn natural gas : no .
almost every business method for electricity nowadays is now co2 , except renewables and nuclear energy .
so , what we need to do on a global level is to create a new system .
we need energy miracle .
if i use the term &quot; wonders , &quot; i don &apos;t mean the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
the internet and services is a miracle .
people here have contributed to the development of many of these wonder .
usually there is no geek that you need a miracle to a certain date .
usually you &apos;re just just going to be wrong and some people are not .
but in this case , we have to get full gas and get a miracle in a very short time .
now , i asked myself , how can i really get this out ?
is there a natural representation of notation , a demonstration that the idea of people here are rising ?
i remembered last year when i got mosquitos and somehow liked people .
the idea was really effective for you , you know , there are people living with mosquitos .
for energy , this is what i dropped .
i decided that the release from fireflies would be the environment to the environment .
so here are some natural fireflies .
you fake me that you don &apos;t bite . actually you won &apos;t even leave the glass .
well , there are all kinds of playful solutions like this , but they don &apos;t get much .
we need solutions , either one or multiple that have an unimaginable scaling and unimaginable reliable , and even though there are many directions where people are looking for it , i really only see five who can do this big demands .
i &apos;ve dropped in time , geothermal , fusion and biopower .
this may be a moderate contribution , and if you do better than i expect , it would be great , but my core statement is that we have to work on all of those five , and we can &apos;t give up from them because they have significant problems .
let &apos;s first look at the burning fossil fuels , burning off of either coal or natural gas .
what you have to do there may seem to be just , but it &apos;s not . you have to have all the co2 that comes from the burning of the rock , catching up , under pressure , and then store and hope that it stays there .
there are a bunch of mushroom projects that create that on a 60 percent -- 80 percent of them , but to get 100 percent of it , it &apos;s going to be very difficult to get , and one of the problems of the co2 is to create a great challenge .
who will make it secure ?
who can be guarantee something literally many billion times larger than any kind of waste that you can imagine from nuclear and other things ?
that &apos;s a lot of volume .
so this is a tough nut .
next : nuclear energy .
it also has three major problems . the cost of particularly high-law countries are high . the question for security is that you really feel that nothing can go wrong , despite the human contribution , that the fuel is not used for weapons .
and then what do you do with the waste ?
because although it &apos;s not very large , there &apos;s a lot of concerns .
so three very difficult problems that might be soluble and that you should work on .
the last three of the five , i &apos;ve summarized .
it &apos;s renewables , as they &apos;re often called .
and also , even though it &apos;s great that they don &apos;t need fuel -- they have a few subsections .
one is the energy that makes these technologies dramatically lower than power works .
these are energy services , you talk about many square miles , thousands of times more land than a normal power plant .
furthermore , these vents underpins .
the sun doesn &apos;t seem the whole day , it doesn &apos;t shine every day , and the wind doesn &apos;t always blow the wind .
so , if you depend on these sources , you have to have a way of getting energy in times if you &apos;re not available .
so there &apos;s big price challenges here , there are challenges at transmission . if we say that the energy source is outside of the country , you don &apos;t just need the technology , you have to get the energy from where it comes from .
and there &apos;s the storage problem .
and to show you all sorts of batteries , i &apos;ve made all kinds of batteries that are made , looking at the cars , computers , cell phones , pops , for everything . and that &apos;s what i &apos;ve been doing with the amount of electronic energy , which is the world using the world , and i found that all batteries that we are producing now less than 10 minutes .
so we need a big breakthrough here , something that is going to be a factor 100 better than the approaches for the time .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
this is what happens when you try to say that subbroble sources about what we call 20 percent -- 30 percent of the consumer .
if you want to engage in 100 percent , you need an incredible novel battery .
now where are we going to go : what is the right approach ?
&quot; manhattan project &quot; ? how do we get to the target ?
what we need is a lot of companies that are working on this . hundreds of them .
in each one of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
in many people , they &apos;ll say , they &apos;re crazy ! that &apos;s good .
i think there &apos;s a lot of people here in the ted group .
bill sized has multiple companies , among other people called an esolar the great solar thermal technology .
vinvet khoster invested in dozens of companies doing the great things and have interesting opportunities and i try to support that .
nathan myhrvold and i finance a company that , maybe surprisingly , the nuclear approach .
there are some innovations in nuclear space ; modular , liquid .
the development has stopped in this industry a while ago , so it &apos;s not a great surprise that some good concepts are around .
the terrapowerpoint concept means that instead of one part of the empire that one percent , the u235 , we decided to burn the 99 percent , the u238 .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , you &apos;ve been thinking about it for a long time , but you could never possibly simulate whether it would work , but there &apos;s modern supercomputer , you can simulate it and see that , yes . with the right materialical approach , it looks like it works .
and because you &apos;re burning these 99 percent , it &apos;s very much better .
in fact , you burn the waste , and you can actually use the waste of the trash , and you can actually use the waste of your own reactors .
instead of breaking your head on it , just burn it . a great thing .
the uranium is used by graduate consumption , a little bit like a candle .
you can see it &apos;s a kind of pillar , often known as &quot; traveling wave reactor . &quot;
that really solves the fuel problem .
here &apos;s a picture of a place in kentucky .
this is the waste , the 99 percent . you have the part that &apos;s being burned out today , so it &apos;s called the warm empire .
the wall for hundreds of years .
and if you look at the ocean water , and you easily get enough fuel for the rest of the planet .
you know , there are many challenges , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to get forward .
let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
how should our records look ?
now , let &apos;s go to the destination that we need to reach and then we talk about the interstep .
many people talk about an 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
it &apos;s really important that we get there .
the rest of the 20 percent will be produced in the poor countries , and still a little bit of agriculture . hopefully it &apos;s going to be a whale drone and cement up until then .
so to reach this 80 percent , the industrial countries , including countries like china , are completely reforming their electricity .
the other note is whether we use the zero emissions technology , whether it &apos;s used in all developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest .
that &apos;s great .
this is going to be a key element of this exhibition .
if we go back from there , how should it look like 2020 ?
it should be the two elements again .
we should use the efficiency of improvement to get it down to the way . the less we get measent , the smaller the carbon dioxide will be , and the temperature is also the temperature .
but actually , this note for the things that we do not completely lead to the big reductions , just the same , or even less important as the other , which is the speed of innovation for these breakthroughs .
we need to track this breakthroughs with full gas , and we can measure this : in corporate numbers , in mushroom projects and regulation changes .
there are lots of great books to this topic .
the al gore &apos;s book &quot; we have the choice &quot; and david mckays &quot; eureka energy . &quot;
they really go through and create a frame where this can be discussed wide because we need to support all sides .
there &apos;s a lot that needs to come together .
that &apos;s a wish .
a very specific wish that we invent this technology .
if you just give me a wish for the next 50 years , i could pick the president , a vaccine , and i love that wish , or i could choose that wish , which is , you know , halding energy penis without co2 .
this has the biggest impact .
if we don &apos;t get this wish , the dig between the long-term and short-term people are terrible enough to get terrible between the united states and china , between poor and rich and almost all of these two billion .
so what do we need to do ?
what are i appposing ?
we need to apply for more exploration funding .
if countries are meeting in places like copying , they shouldn &apos;t just talk about co2 .
they should discuss this innovation , and they would be shocked by the ridiculous people that are spent available for these innovative approaches .
we need market incentives , carbon dioxide , fishing &amp; amp ; trade is something that creates a price signal .
we need to spread the message .
we need to rationize dialogue and complete things , and also the things that are taken by the government .
it &apos;s an important wish , but i think we can meet it .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you very much . just to understand a little bit better -- first of all , can you give us an idea of scale of this investment ?
bill gates : to do the simulation on a supercomputer , to get all the major scientists , what we &apos;ve done , we only need a few 10 million , and even if we &apos;ve tested our materials in a russian reactor to make sure that it works in the 100 million .
the hard step is building the first reformers , to find another billion , the regular interface and the location of the reality .
as soon as the first is done , when it comes to the way i promised it , it &apos;s all clear , because the economic economy is so different from energy energy as we know it .
in order to understand the right thing : building deep in the ground almost like a vertical fuel fuel , which , and then the process starts , and then the process starts to work down ?
bg : right . now , you &apos;ve got to refill the reactor , so there &apos;s lots of people and many controls that can go wrong . this thing where you open it up and it &apos;s not good .
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can fill it for 60 years -- think of a column that you &apos;re buried without all the complexity .
and it &apos;s sitting there and it burns 60 years and then it &apos;s finished .
a nuclear reactor , which offers a solution to the trash .
bg : yeah . well , what happens to the waste of waste : you can let it sit -- there &apos;s much less waste with this method -- then you take it and put it on the next reactor .
and we start by taking the waste , which is already there , that lies in these refrigerator , or dry people , that &apos;s our starting fuel .
so , what &apos;s a problem for these reactors is what we put in our own and it will reduce the volume of garbage as this process .
but while they talked to different people of this world about these possibilities .
where is the greatest interest , really ?
bg : well , we haven &apos;t put ourselves on a place , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting open rules for everything that is called &quot; nuclear . &quot; there &apos;s a big interest and the people of the company in russia , india , china -- i &apos;ve been here and talked about the energy agenda .
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and the japanese have made something .
this is an alternative of one thing that was made .
this is an important step forward , but it &apos;s like a fast reactor , and some countries have built this , so everyone who has done a fast reactor , a candidate for our first .
in their imagination , phase and probability of something really to life ?
bg : well , we need one of these scaling , generic things that are very inexpensive , we &apos;ve got 20 years to invent and then spend 20 years .
this is sort of the geek that shows us the environmental models that we need to keep .
and , you know , terrapower , if everything goes well , and that &apos;s a big wish , could keep it easy .
and fortunately , there are dozens of companies today , and we need hundreds of , which , when their approaches are working , that will work for their pilots to work for their pilots .
and it would be best if it gets multiple , because then you could use a mixture .
anyway , we need a solution .
so the big possible breakthroughs , is this the biggest one you know ?
bg : a force is the most important thing .
it would have been the environmental requirement , but it &apos;s so much more important .
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
you know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as this , but there &apos;s the modular method , which is another approach .
there &apos;s a liquid reactor that seems to be a little bit hard , but maybe they say that .
and so there are different , but the nice thing about it is that an ancient molecule has a million times as much energy as it is , say , a coal molecule , and that is , if you &apos;re able to deal with the issues , the impact and the other things , the impact , the impact and other things , is the potential of the land and the other things .
if that doesn &apos;t work , what ?
do we need to reframe intent to try and maintain the earth &apos;s temperature stable ?
bg : when you get into this situation , it &apos;s like eating too much , and just before a heart attack . what do you do ? you might need a heart operation or something like that .
there &apos;s a research that is called geoengineering , which is going to work with different techniques to delay warming , so that we would spend 20 or 30 years longer to get together .
this is just an insurance method .
you hope we don &apos;t need it .
some people say you shouldn &apos;t even work on insurance because you probably do the lazy , so you continue to eat because you know that the heart surgery is going to save .
i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s smart , if you get the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s now a discourse in geoengineering about whether you have to get the things faster , or that innovation costs longer than we expect .
climaskegue : do you have one or two sentences for that to maybe convince you ?
bg : well , unfortunately , the skeptics are living in very different camps .
those who make scientific arguments are very little .
do you say that there are negative effects to do with the clouds that move things out ?
there are very , very few things you can tell at all , which is a chance in a million .
the main problem here is similar to aids .
you make the mistake now , and you pay for a lot later .
and that &apos;s why the idea is , now , if you have all kinds of urgent problems , to invest in something that you only have later -- and that &apos;s the fact that the investment is not necessarily the worst scenario , and there are people in the rich world , and there are people in the rich world .
the fact is that this uncertainty should make us worry .
but my dream here is that , if you can make it economic , and at the same time the co2 , the skeptics say , &quot; okay , i don &apos;t really care that it &apos;s no carbon dioxide , i wish it &apos;s not a carbon dioxide . &quot;
and that would be your answer to the bja lomborg argument , that if you use all of these time and energy to solve the co2 problem , all the other goals that are going on below that , the poverty of malaria and so on is going to be a stupid waste of resources that we can do .
bg : well , the real spending for research -- let &apos;s say the u.s. should spend 10 billion a year more than they do today -- that &apos;s not so dramatic .
other things don &apos;t suffer .
you come up with big sums of money , and you can have reasonable people talking , if you have something that &apos;s not economically , and it &apos;s trying to fund that . for me , most of the waste is waste .
because it &apos;s very short in front of a cost-run and funded only the learning curve , and i think we should try more things that have the potential to be much cheaper .
if the bottom you get , it &apos;s a very high power of energy , you can only keep the rich ones .
i mean , every one of us here may spend five times more for our energy without changing its lifestyle .
but for the bottom two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
and even lomborg thinks .
his new magend is now : &quot; why don &apos;t research work more ? &quot;
he &apos;s still going to be , because of his earlier stories , with skepticism camp , but he has understood that this is a very common group , and therefore he brings the research argument .
and that &apos;s a leap that i think is appropriate .
research , it &apos;s just crazy how few people are supporting .
bill , i think i &apos;m talking about all the people here , if i say , i really hope you will be true . thank you very much .
bg : thank you .
a few years ago , here at ted , peter skillman did a design competition called &quot; the marshmallow challenge . &quot;
the idea is pretty simple . fourth teams have to get the biggest possible structure with 20 spaghetti , about 1m tape , about 400 feet , and a marshmallow .
the marshmallow needs to be on top .
and , although it really seems to be really easy , it &apos;s really hard because people are pushing very quickly .
and so i thought this is an interesting idea , and i turned it into a design workshop .
it was a huge success .
since then , i &apos;ve been doing about 70 workshops around the world , with students , developing countries , and architects , even with ctos the fortune 50 companies , and there &apos;s something that &apos;s deep about it , and i &apos;m going to share some of them .
normally most people take care of themselves in the task .
you talk about it , you think , how it &apos;s going to look , it &apos;s about power .
then they invest a little bit in planning and organization , and they plot spaghetti .
they spend a lot of their time growing up all the time .
and finally , soon before you don &apos;t have time , someone takes the marshmallow , and you put it on the top , you go back to the top , step back and you admire your work .
but what happens , almost always , is that the &quot; ta-da &quot; is going to be a &quot; uh-oh &quot; because the weight of the marshmallow makes the whole thing tick and down .
there are a number of people who have much more &quot; uh-oh &quot; moments than others , and under the worst are fresh bwl graduates .
they lie , they cheat , they &apos;re confused , and they make very drich shapes .
and of course , there are teams that are much more like &quot; ta-da &quot; forms , and under the best graduates of the child &apos;s car .
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
as peter told us not only the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
what you might ask is : how does this happen ? why ? what about those ?
and peter says , &quot; no one of the children spent time to be at boss gmbh . &quot;
they don &apos;t invest time in power .
there &apos;s another reason .
and that is that bwl students were trained to find a real plan , ok .
and then realizing it .
what happens when you put the marshmallow on the top , you don &apos;t have time and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
what children do differently is they start to start with the marshmallow and build prototypes , successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow on the top , so that they have a tendency to repair the possibility of fixing prototypes .
constructers recognize these kinds of collaboration as a core assessment .
and with each trial , the kids will get straight feedback and what doesn &apos;t .
so the performance is to work with prototypes , but let &apos;s see how different teams operate .
the average for most of it is about 8,000 inches , bwl students are doing something more , but not much , children &apos;s children are better than the adults .
who &apos;s the most successful ?
architects and engineers , fortunately .
1m is the highest thing i &apos;ve seen .
and why ? because they understand triangles and correcting self-organizing patterns are the key to build stable structures .
ceo are above average . but here it gets interesting .
you get an execular administrator on the team , you get significantly better better .
it &apos;s incredible . you look around and you see &quot; this team will win . &quot;
you can predict that . why is this ?
because they have special skills of processing .
they take the process , they understand it .
and that team , which is going to watch and work on the work of the team significant .
specialized skills and processor skills lead to success .
if you have 10 teams that are typical , you get about six , the stable structures .
i was trying to do something interesting now .
i thought , let &apos;s get the pocker out .
so i offered a 10,000-dollar prize for the winners .
what do you think happened to these design students ?
what was the result ?
this is what happened . not a team had a stable structure .
if anyone would have built 2.5500 an inch , he would have carried the price home .
so isn &apos;t it interesting that high competition has a strong effect ?
we repaired this exercise with the same student .
now what do you think happened ?
now , they understood the benefit of &quot; prototyping . &quot;
so , from the same , bad team of one under the best .
they produced the highest construction in the least time .
there are so deep lessons for us , about the nature of drive and success .
you might ask : why would someone actually invest in the time to create a marshmallow challenge ?
the reason is , i help digital tools and processes to help teams , cars , video games and &quot; visuals &quot; .
and what the marshmallow force does is it tells you to identify assumptions .
because frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge offers a common experience , a common language or a basic basis to build the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , this kind of simple exercise .
and those of you who interest in it can go back to marshmallow parade .
it &apos;s a blog where you can see how to build the marshmallow .
there &apos;s a pac-step manual there .
they find crazy examples of all over the world , like people optimize the system and disperfy .
there are also zones of affairs .
and the base lesson , i think , is actually the construction of sports .
it demands that we all have our senses on the task , and we use our thinking of our thinking , how our emotions and our do , in the challenge of us .
and sometimes a little prototype of this experience is everything that takes us from a &quot; uh-oh &quot; moment .
and that can make a difference .
thank you .
let &apos;s have a machine here .
a big machine , a cool , ted machine , and that &apos;s a time machine .
and everyone in this room needs to go inside .
and you can go to the past , you can go into the future ; you can &apos;t stay in here and now .
and i wonder what you would choose , because i &apos;ve been asking my friends a lot lately , and they wanted to go to the past .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back to the time before there was cars or twitter or &quot; america . &quot;
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m convinced that somehow you &apos;re kind of drawn to nostalgy to think .
and i understand that .
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to go to the past , and not because i &apos;m a adventurman .
it &apos;s because possibilities are not going back on this planet , they go forward .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go to the future .
this is the greatest time that there was ever on this planet , no matter what scale they &apos;re going to do : health , wealth , mobility , chance of disease .
there was never a time before .
my great-great-grandparents died as they were 60 .
my grandparents raised this number on 701 .
my parents are the 80 on the heel .
so there should be a nine at the beginning of my death number .
but it &apos;s not about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
a child who &apos;s born in new delhi today may expect to live as long as the richest man in the world 100 years ago .
think about it . this is an incredible fact .
and why is that ?
smallpox . smallpox has killed billions of people on this planet .
they reformed the earth &apos;s demographics in a way that no war has ever done .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
we dismissed it . puff .
in the rich world , diseases that have millions of us are still threatened by one generation only .
diphers , roman , child paralysis ...
does anybody know what that is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , are successes of science .
and from my view of view , the scientific method , things look like it works , it changes if it doesn &apos;t do it , one of the great achievements of humanity .
so that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , the whole good news is , because there are some other problems , and they &apos;ve been mentioned .
and one of them is that despite all of our achievements a billion people are hungry to bed every day .
this number up , and it goes up very quickly , and it &apos;s embarrassing .
and not only that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to devarate this world .
drinking water , ancient land , rainforests , oil , gas : they disappear , soon , and if we don &apos;t out of this chaos , we &apos;re going to go out .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that will feed billions people , without the country that they live on .
i think we can power this world with energy that doesn &apos;t happen at the same time .
i really believe that , and no , that &apos;s not a wonderful one .
but this keeps me awake -- one of the things i wake up at night . we &apos;ve never needed scientific progress as much as now , never yet .
and we &apos;ve never been able to put it in the way that we can .
we &apos;re at the threshold of amazing , amazing events on many areas , and yet i really think that we had to go to a hundred , 300 years before the enlightenment , to find a time where we &apos;ve been fighting progress in the future that we &apos;ve been fighting about these things .
people sit down in their faith , and that &apos;s so tight you can &apos;t free them .
not even the truth will free .
and listen , everybody has a right to think of his opinion ; even a fairly true opinion to progress .
but you know what they don &apos;t have ?
they don &apos;t have their own facts . &apos; bye , they don &apos;t have .
and i took a while to figure that out .
about a decade ago , i wrote an article about vaccine for &quot; the new yorker , &quot; a little article .
and i was amazed to break on resistance , on resistance of what the most effective means in the health care system in human history .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i just did what i always do , i wrote a paper and went on .
and soon , i was writing an article about genetic food .
the same thing , just bigger .
people were playing crazy .
so i wrote a paper about it , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that would be &quot; frankenfood , &quot; why they believed that molecules were a very random way to move on the nature of nature .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i continued .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
we type , we get rich , we eat , that &apos;s okay .
but this article made me worry , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and finally , i found out .
and that &apos;s because these fanatics made me crazy at all .
these were surrounded people , educated people , decent people .
they were just like the people in this room .
and i got so confused .
but then i thought , you know what , let &apos;s be honest .
we &apos;re at a point where we don &apos;t have the same ratio to progress as we used to .
we &apos;re talking about it .
we &apos;re talking ironic about it , which is , &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , there are reasons , and i think we know what the reasons that are .
we have trust in institutions , authority , and sometimes in science , and there &apos;s no reason why it shouldn &apos;t be .
you can just call a few names and people will understand .
chernobyl , bo , the challenger , vioxx , weapons of weapons , the u.s. presidential election .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with people that we thought they would always be right . so be skeptical .
ask questions , ask the evidence , demand evidence .
don &apos;t take anything like that .
but now , if you have to get the evidence , you have to take this evidence , and we &apos;re not good at that .
and i can tell the reason that we now live in an epidemic of fear , as i &apos;ve never seen , and hopefully never see .
about 12 years ago , a story was published , a terrible story that the autism epidemic with the masder epidemic associated with the masters and the roman vaccine .
very frightening .
the study of studies were done to see if that was true .
exploration studies should be done ; that &apos;s a serious issue .
the data came in .
the data came in the united states , from england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all the same , no correlation , no connection , no connection .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference . it doesn &apos;t make any difference because we believe in anecdotes , we believe what we see to see what we &apos;re seeing .
we don &apos;t believe in a pile of documents that gives us data , and i understand that i think we all do .
but you know what ?
the result of this was catastrophic .
catastrophic hal because of this fact : the united states is one of the only countries in the world that impuses for masers .
this is scandally and we should be ashamed .
it &apos;s awful .
what happened is we could do that .
well , i understand that . i do .
because anybody here has masers ?
has a single one in the audience ever seen anybody dying ?
it &apos;s not very often happening .
this is not happening in this country , but 160,000 times in the world last year .
this is a lot of deaths through masers , 20 per hour .
but because that &apos;s not what happened here , we can do it , and people like jenny mccarthy can walk around and make messages from fear and ileliteracy and larry king live .
and they can do that because they don &apos;t connect cause and correlation .
you don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be equal , but almost never the same .
and that &apos;s something we need to learn , and very quickly .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .
he liberated us from one of the worst minds of mankind .
no fear , no torture , child paralysis , puff , disappeared .
the guy in the middle isn &apos;t so much .
it &apos;s called paul offit .
he has just evolved with a few other people &apos;s worth of rotavirus .
he can save the lives of 400- , 500,000 children a year in the developing world .
pretty good , isn &apos;t it ?
well , that &apos;s good , besides that , that paul goes around and talks about vaccines and says how valuable they are , and that people should just stop talking .
and he actually says that .
so paul is a terrorist .
if paul talks in a public proposition , he can &apos;t tell without armed watders .
he gets calls at home because people like to tell him that they know where his children go to school .
and why ? because paul did a vaccine .
i don &apos;t need that , but vaccines are undeprivation .
if you take it away , the diseases go back , terrible disease , and that &apos;s what happens .
we now have masites in this country .
and that &apos;s getting worse , and pretty soon kids will die again , because that &apos;s just a question of numbers .
and they &apos;re not just going to die on masers .
what about child paralysis ? let &apos;s take this . why not ?
a comet in me wrote a couple of weeks ago , and i said , &quot; i &apos;m a little bit terll . &quot;
nobody ever said that before .
she wouldn &apos;t vaccinate her child against child paralysis . no way .
fa .
why ? because we don &apos;t have a child paralysis , and you know what ?
we didn &apos;t have a child paralysis in this country yesterday .
now , i don &apos;t know , maybe there &apos;s somebody in lagos this morning , and i &apos;m going to go to an airplane , and i &apos;m going to go to los angeles , right now .
and in a few hours , he goes and rented a car , and he comes to long beach , and he &apos;s going to visit one of these magnificent ted dinner tonight .
and he doesn &apos;t know he &apos;s infected with a paralyzing illness , and we don &apos;t know that , because the world is now working .
this is the planet that we live on . don &apos;t do it as if it &apos;s not .
we love to put ourselves in lying . we love it .
have you taken all their vitamins tomorrow ?
echinacea , a little antioxidantium , who helps you on the sales .
i know that they did that because half the americans do it every day .
they take the stuff , and they take alternative cure , and it doesn &apos;t matter how often we find out that they are useless .
the data shows the whole thing .
she evaporates her urine . she &apos;s almost never doing it .
this is okay , you want to get 28 billion dollars for dark urgy .
i agree with you all .
dark protein . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
well , i think i understand -- we hate the drug industry .
we hate too strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
and we shouldn &apos;t . our healthcare system is mies .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely amazing to us , and water to us who can afford it .
so we &apos;re going to walk away , and where do we go ?
we &apos;re walking into the arms of placebo industry .
this is great . i love the placebo industry .
but you know , that &apos;s really a serious thing , because the stuff is crap , and we spend billions of dollars for it .
and i have all kinds of little props here .
kone of them -- gingko , fraud , echinacea , banai , i don &apos;t even know what that is , but we &apos;re spending billions of dollars for it , it &apos;s fraud .
and you know what ? if i say that , people are screaming , and say , &quot; what do you care ? people do what you want . &quot;
that &apos;s how they feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? you &apos;re wrong .
because it doesn &apos;t matter to me whether it &apos;s the minister of health , that says , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m not going to take the evidence of my experts to mammography , &quot; or some cancer source , who wants to treat his patients with caffa .
if you go out on this path , where believe and magic evidence and science are replacing and science , you get to a place where you don &apos;t want to be .
they get to thabo mbeki in south africa .
he brought 400,000 of his people , because he insisted that red beeets were a lot more efficient and lemon oil , and we know that they can stop the course of aids .
hundreds of thousands of imrisk deaths in a country that will be worse than any other one of this disease .
please tell me not that these things have no consequences .
they have them . they always have them .
now , the most brain lotter epidemic in which we &apos;re right now is this absurde struggle between the fear of the labor community and the organic elites .
this is an idiotic debate . it has to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphor .
this is ideology , not science .
everything we eat , every egg , every branch , every branch , has been changed by the people .
you know , there were no mandates in paradise .
there was no cantalums melon .
there was no christmas trees . we did all this .
we did it in the last 11,000 years .
and some of it has worked , and it doesn &apos;t work .
we &apos;ve become , what hasn &apos;t worked .
now we can do it more closely . and , of course , there are risks . but we can do something like vitamin a in rice , and the stuff can help millions of people , millions of people , their lives .
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
i don &apos;t have to understand that .
we are rejecting food .
why do we do that ?
well , what i &apos;m always hearing is too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , monoculture , monoculture , we don &apos;t want to have huge fields with one thing that &apos;s wrong .
we don &apos;t want companies to patent lives .
we don &apos;t want companies to own seeds .
and you know what my answer to all of this is ?
yeah , you &apos;re right . let &apos;s fix that .
it &apos;s true we have a huge food problem , but it &apos;s not science .
that has nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s right , morality , patent stuff .
you know that science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work and sometimes , but the idea that we shouldn &apos;t allow science to do their work , because we &apos;re afraid of being a really dead , and it holds millions of people from disasters .
you know , in the next 50 years , we have to grow 70 percent more food than at the moment . 70 percent .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
shame . shame .
they need that , and we don &apos;t give it to them .
and why ? biodiversity changed .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this hidden stuff , like maniok .
maniok is something that a half billion people eat .
it &apos;s about a mapping .
it &apos;s just a bunch of calories . it &apos;s mies .
it doesn &apos;t have any nutrients ; it doesn &apos;t have any protein , and scientists are building all this .
and then people could eat the food and would not be blind .
you wouldn &apos;t starve , and you know what ?
that would be nice . it wouldn &apos;t be chez panises , but it would be nice .
and all i can say to this is : why do we fight this ?
i mean , let &apos;s ask , why do we fight this ?
because we don &apos;t want to push genes around ?
it &apos;s not about cutting genes around . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our beharols on larger food , better food , more unique food .
it &apos;s not about rice krisders , it &apos;s about getting people alive , and it &apos;s going to be the highest time to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we don &apos;t do that , if we &apos;re going to do something like that , we &apos;re guilty of something that we do not want to be guilty of , high-tech colonialism .
there &apos;s no other description of what &apos;s happening here .
it &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s our not worthy , and we have to really stop it .
so after this incredibly funny conversation , you might want to say , &quot; are you still going to go into this ridiculous time machine and into the future ? &quot;
anyway , that &apos;s definitely what i want to do .
right now , it &apos;s in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can put this time on everything we want .
we can move them where we want to move them , and we &apos;ll move them where we want to move .
we need to have these conversations , and we need to think , but if we go into the time machine , we &apos;ll be happy to have that .
i know that we can , and as far as it is , it &apos;s something that the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
for some time , i &apos;ve become interested in the placebo effect , and it might seem strange that a magician is interested in it , because , you know , you &apos;re looking at it as &quot; a deception that &apos;s going to be a little bit when someone thinks about it . &quot;
in other words , sugar pills have shown a measurable effect , the placebo effect , and that &apos;s because the person thinks what &apos;s going on with them , is a pharmaceutical or a kind of -- in pain management , for example , if the patient &apos;s only stuck enough at the heart of the body that &apos;s going to happen .
a deception becomes something that is real , because someone is so concerned .
so we can also understand each other , i want to show you a fundamental , very simple magic trick .
and i &apos;m going to show you how he works . this is a trick that has at least the 1950s in every magic book for kids .
i learned it from the cub scout magic of the paths in the 1970s .
i &apos;m going to do it for you , and then explain it .
and then i &apos;m going to explain why i &apos;ll explain it .
so , look what happens .
the knife you can study , my hand , you can study .
i &apos;m just going to get the knife just in my lazy .
i get my sleeve back .
and to make sure that nothing in my sleeve disappears or out of him , i &apos;m just going to push my wrist right here .
in this way , you can see there &apos;s no time moving anything . as long as i push here , nothing can go to my sleeve or come out .
and the goal is very simple .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully , if everything goes well , the knife is held through my blog physical magnetic magnetism .
it &apos;s actually sitting on his place that i can shake it , without the knife falling down .
nothing goes out in my sleeve or come out , no trickster . and you can study everything .
ta-da !
well , this is a trick that i often bring to little kids who are interested in magic , because you can learn a lot about deception when you look closely , even though it &apos;s a very simple trick .
probably many of you in the room know this trick .
it works like this .
i hold the knife in my hand .
i say that i close my wrist to make sure that nothing disappears in my sleeve or out , and that &apos;s a lie .
the reason i summarize my wrist is that it &apos;s the real secret of illusion .
because at the moment , where i &apos;m going to turn my hand away from you so you see it from back , this finger is moving here , my finger , just from where he was , in a position where he was so outblown .
great trick ?
there &apos;s someone in the back who didn &apos;t have childhood .
so , he &apos;s here . right .
and when i turn around , the finger changes his position .
and now you could talk about why this is a deception , why you don &apos;t get to see that there &apos;s only three fingers down here , because the mind and the way it processes information , it doesn &apos;t count two , one , two , three , but it &apos;s a group .
but that &apos;s not really what i &apos;m doing now . and then i open my hand .
of course , it &apos;s been held there , but not by the magnetism of my body , but through a trick , through my time , that &apos;s right now .
and when i close my hand , the same thing happens by turning back to me , is hidden through this movement that the finger goes back again .
i take this hand away . and here &apos;s the knife .
this trick can be present to your friends and neighbors . thank you .
now , what does this have to do with the placebo effect ?
before a year or so , i read a study that really resonated me .
i &apos;m not a doctor or scientist , and that was an amazing thing for me .
because it turns out that if you offer a placebo in the form of a white pill in the form of an psychotic pill , it &apos;s just a round , white pill that has a particular measurement effect .
but if you put the shape in which you &apos;re going to take the placebo , for example , in a smaller pill , and these blue color and a letter on it , it &apos;s actually measurable effective .
and that , although none of any pharmaceutical -- it &apos;s just sugar pills .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
what ? that made me crazy .
but it turned out that it wasn &apos;t all .
if you take capls , it &apos;s more effective than a pill every form .
a colored capsule , which is at a end yellow and on the other red , is better than a white capsule .
also , the dosage plays a role .
a pill twice is not as good as three pills -- i can &apos;t remember the exact statistics . i &apos;m sorry .
but the key thing is , ...
... also the dosizations play a role .
and the shape plays a role .
and if you want to have the ultimate placebo effect , you need to reach the needle .
right ? a syringe with a effective -- a few milliters of a effective substance that you inject a patient .
this creates a very strong picture in your head . it &apos;s very much more powerful than a white pill .
this chart is really ... i &apos;m going to show you another time , if we have a projector .
in fact , the white pill doesn &apos;t seem as good as the blue pill that doesn &apos;t seem as good as a capsule that doesn &apos;t seem as good as the needle .
and none of it has any really pharmaceutical property . it &apos;s just our faith in making a stronger effect .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
i take something which is obviously a deception , and let it look real .
we know from the study that you need to reach to the needle when it &apos;s supposed to be .
this is an 18-inch of hutneedle , and it &apos;s very , very quiet , and i &apos;m first going to give you a little bit of punishment .
this is really my flesh . it &apos;s not damgous .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
i &apos;m going to stick this needle into my skin and push it through , until you reprint on the other side .
if you &apos;re evil -- if you fall easily in ounds -- i &apos;ve launched a couple of friends last night in the hotel room , and some people i didn &apos;t know , and it &apos;s a woman that i didn &apos;t know about , and that &apos;s a woman &apos;s force .
so i propose that if you &apos;re going to be very bad , then you &apos;ll look away for the next 30 seconds , or , you know what , i &apos;m going to do the first one in the back .
you can see it right now , but you can see , if you want .
so , it &apos;s like this , right here , where my flesh is beginning , at the bottom of my arm , i &apos;m just going to take a little bit of applause .
i &apos;m really sorry . does it make you crazy ?
and now just a little bit of my skin and so forth on the other side .
now we &apos;re actually in the same situation that we had at the cutting trick .
about .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
so , i &apos;ll show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well .
i know what people think when they see that .
they say , &quot; okay , that &apos;s not so stupid , and the skin just turns through the skin for a few minutes . &quot;
well , then i &apos;ll show you .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and the people in the back say , &quot; okay . i didn &apos;t see that right . &quot;
the people in the side are coming up now .
let me show you out of the way .
this is really my skin . that &apos;s not a special effect of hollywood .
this is my flesh , and i can turn it around .
sorry . if you &apos;re bad , look away , don &apos;t look at it .
the people in the back or the ones , the later on video , will say , &quot; well , it looks pretty impressive , but if it &apos;s real , it would be , you know , this is a hole , it would be a hole , it would be a hole . &quot;
okay , let me burst a little bit of blood for you .
yeah , here it is .
i normally would take out the needle .
i would have my arm clean and show you that there are no wounds .
but i think in this frame here , and with the intention of doing something real , i &apos;m going to just make the needle in there and go from the stage .
we &apos;ll meet a couple of times in the next days .
i hope you &apos;re looking for it . thank you very much .
everybody talks about happiness today .
i have a couple of people counting the number of books that were published with &quot; happiness &quot; in the last five years , and they gave about 40 , and there was much more .
there &apos;s a tremendous wave of interest among researchers .
there &apos;s a lot of happiness .
everybody would like to make people happier .
but despite all of this tide of work , there are multiple cognitive ones that are sort of impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk today is mainly about these cognitive ones .
that &apos;s true of laver , thinking about your happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists who think about happiness , because it turns out that we are so confused as everyone else .
the first of these fall is to admit complexity .
it turns out that the word of happiness is simply not a useful word , because we apply it to too many different things .
i think there &apos;s a certain meaning that we could narrow it down , but in the large and all the time , that &apos;s something we need to give up , and we &apos;re going to have to take the complicated view of what is well-being .
the second trap is a change of experience and memory : basically it &apos;s between being happy in its life and happy about his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both locked together in the notion of happiness .
and the third is the concentrations illusion , and that &apos;s the unhappy fact that we can &apos;t think about a situation that affects well-being without its meaning to wardness .
i mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
now , i &apos;d like to start with one example of someone who had a questionable response meeting after one of my lectures , which was a story . &#91; unclear &#93; he said he heard a singer , and it was absolutely miraculous , and it was a terrible piece of music , and it was a terrible piece of music .
and then he added , really , pretty emotional , that ruins all the experience .
but it didn &apos;t .
what it had ruined was the memories of the experience .
he had the experience .
he had had 20 minutes of music .
they didn &apos;t count because he was able to relove with a memory ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was everything he got to keep .
what really tells us is that we could think about ourselves and about other people in the sense of two types of self .
there &apos;s a living self that lives in the present , and the present knowledge is capable of experiencing the past , but basically only the presence .
it &apos;s the living self , which is the doctor -- you know , when the doctor says , &quot; does it hurt if i &apos;m doing it here ? &quot;
and then there &apos;s a memory of self , and the memory itself is , and the story of our life is going to get the story of our lives , and it &apos;s in denial that the doctor is talking about , &quot; how did you feel in the last time ? &quot;
or , &quot; how was your journey to albania ? &quot; or something like that .
these are two very different units , the living self and the recall itself , and the two of them are part of the interplay of the concept of happiness .
now , the memory itself is a storyteller .
and that really starts with a fundamental response to our memories -- it starts instantly .
we &apos;re not just telling stories when we &apos;re doing stories .
our memory tells us stories that we can keep from our experience is a story .
and let &apos;s start with one example .
there &apos;s an old study .
these are real patients pulling out a painful procedure .
i &apos;m not going to go into the details . it &apos;s not painful today , but it was painful than this study in the 1990s .
they were asked to report all 60 seconds about their pain .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
and you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; who have suffered more ? &quot;
and this is a very simple question .
patient b has clearly suffered more . his gut reflection was longer , and every minute of pain , the patient had a patient b , and more .
but now there &apos;s another question : &quot; how much did these patients think they were suffering ? &quot;
and here &apos;s a surprise .
and the surprise is that patient a is a much worse reminder of the gut mirror as a patient b.
the stories of gut mirror were different , and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends .
and none of these stories is very intricate or great -- but one of them is this clear ...
but one of them is clearly worse than the other .
and the worse is where the pain was at the end of his peak . it &apos;s a bad story .
how do we know ?
because we asked these people to mirror their gut , and also a lot later , &quot; how bad was the whole thing ? &quot;
and she was much worse for a than for b in memory .
well , this is a direct conflict between the living self and the memory itself .
in terms of the living self , b was clearly a bad time .
well , what you could do with patient a , and we &apos;ve actually done clinical trials , and it &apos;s been done , and it &apos;s done , and it &apos;s working , you could actually make the gut mirror of the patient a long way to shake it up .
that will lead to the patient , but only a little less than before .
and if you do that for a few minutes , you make that the living self is worse , and you &apos;ve made a much better reminder of your patient &apos;s memory , because now you have a better story about your experience .
does a story show up ?
and that &apos;s true of the stories that gives us memory and it &apos;s true for the stories we invent .
it turns out to be a story , major eye looking and end .
it &apos;s very , very important and in this case dominated by the end .
now , living self is alive .
it &apos;s got eye look , one after another .
and you ask : what happens to these moments ?
and the answer is really easy . they &apos;re always lost forever .
i mean most moments of our lives -- and i &apos;ve got this -- you know , the psychological present is about three seconds long . which means , you know , it &apos;s about 600 million of them , in a month , there &apos;s about 600 million of them .
most of them are being completely ignored by the memory themselves .
and yet , you get the impression that you should count that what happens during the eye of life is our life .
it &apos;s the limited resource we consume in this world .
and as we would use it , it seems to be important , but it &apos;s not the story that keeps the memory for us .
so we have the memory itself and the living self , and they &apos;re really quite different .
the biggest difference between them is to deal with time .
from view of the living self , if you have a holiday , and the second week is as good as the first one , then the two-week vacation is twice as good as the week vacation .
this is not how it works at all .
for the recall itself , a weekly week is barely better than the one-week vacation , because there &apos;s no new memories added .
they didn &apos;t change the story .
and in this way , time is actually the critical variable that makes a reminder of itself from a living self . time has very little influence on this story .
now the memory itself makes more than remembering and telling stories .
it &apos;s actually , in fact , the choices that are selected , because if you have a patient , you have two of these two different surgeons in two different surgeons , and they decide what to choose , then that &apos;s the one that &apos;s going to pick the memory that &apos;s going to be accepted and that &apos;s the surgeon who &apos;s being selected .
the living self has no voice in this choice .
in fact , we don &apos;t choose between experience . we choose to experience experiences .
and even if we think about the future , we don &apos;t usually think of our future as an experience .
we think about our future in terms of predicting memories .
and in fact , you can look at this , you know , as a tyranny of memory , and you can think of the memory itself as one , which is kind of the living self that doesn &apos;t need the living self .
i have the impression that if we make a holiday that &apos;s very common , that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing in the service of the memory .
and that &apos;s a little hard to justify .
i mean , how much of our memories ?
this is one of the explanations that &apos;s given for the dominance of ourselves .
and when i think about it , i think of a vacation that we did a few years ago in antarctica , which was clearly the best vacation i had ever had , and i think relatively often about how often i think of other vacation .
and i probably have about my memories of this three-week journey , i would say about 25 minutes in the last four years .
now , if i had ever opened the folder with the 600 paintings , i spent another hour .
well , these are three weeks , and that &apos;s probably a half a hour .
there seems to be an inconsistent .
now , i like to be a little extreme , you know , how little appetite did i have on the toddler of memories , but even if you have more of it , why do you give a real question , why are we giving memories so much weight in the value that we give ?
so i want you to think about an thought experiment .
imagine your next vacation , you know , at the end of the vacation , all of your images are being wiped out , and you get an amnestic drug so that you &apos;re not going to remember anything .
now , would you choose the same vacation ?
and if you would choose another vacation , there &apos;s a conflict between your two types of self and you have to think about how you decide that conflict and that &apos;s really not obvious at all , because if you think of it as time , you might get an answer . and if you think of the experience of the memories , you might get a different answer .
why we choose the vacation that we choose is a problem that makes us a choice between the two types of self .
now , the two types of self throw two terms of happiness .
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can use , one per self .
so you can ask : how happy is that living self ?
and then you &apos;d ask : how happy are the moments of living itself ?
and they &apos;re all -- happiness is a pretty complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
and , by the way , we &apos;re able to get a fairly good idea from the happiness of living itself over time .
if you think about happiness , it &apos;s a very different thing .
it &apos;s not about how happy a person lives .
it &apos;s about how happy or pleased the person is when this person thinks about their life .
very different term .
and everybody who &apos;s not going to be doing this terms differently is the study of happiness , and i &apos;m a lot of researchers talking about well-being , the study of happiness for the long time .
the distinction between happiness &apos;s happiness and happiness has been realized in the last few years , and now you &apos;re working on measuring the two separate .
the gallup organization has a global survey in which more than half a million people have asked questions about what they think about their lives and about their experiences , and there were other efforts in the direction .
so over the last few years , we started learning about the happiness of the self .
and the main lesson that i think we learned is that they &apos;re really different .
you can know how happy someone is with his life , and it doesn &apos;t really teach you much about how happy he lives and vice versa .
just to give you a sense of the correlation , the correlation is about five .
what that means is that if you would meet somebody and you would tell them , oh , his father is a two-meter man , how much would you know about his size ?
well , you would know about his size , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
if i tell you that someone has come to your life as eight on a scale of 10 , you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy it is .
so the correlation is low .
we know something about the happiness of happiness itself .
we know that money is very important , it &apos;s very important .
we know that happiness is mostly true to be happy with people we like to spend time with people we like .
there are other pleasure , but that &apos;s dominant .
so if you want to maximize the lucky of the two types of self , you will end up doing very different things .
the implication of what i said here is that we shouldn &apos;t really imagine happiness as a substitute for well-being .
it &apos;s a completely different notion .
well , very quickly , another reason we can &apos;t think about happiness is that we don &apos;t look at the same things when we think about life and when we actually live .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people are in california , they won &apos;t get the correct answer .
when you think about this question , people have to be happier in california when they say , in ohio , we live in ohio .
and what happens is , when you think about life in california , you think about the difference between california and other places , and this difference is , say , in climate .
well , it turns out that climate is not very important for the living itself , and it &apos;s not even very important for the evidence that decides how happy people are .
but now , because it &apos;s responsible for yourself , you can end up with a few people at the end of california .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to track what happens to people that go to california in hope .
now , you &apos;re not going to be happier .
we know this .
but one thing is going to happen . you think you &apos;re happier , because if you &apos;re going to think about it , you &apos;re going to remind you how awful the weather was in ohio , and you &apos;ll feel that you &apos;ve made the right decision .
it &apos;s very hard to think about well-being , and i hope i &apos;ve given you a sense of how difficult it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question for you .
thank you .
now , when we talked about a couple of weeks ago , they decided that there was a rather interesting result that came out of this gallup survey .
is that something you can share with us , because now you have a few minutes left ?
daniel kahneman : sure .
i think the most interesting thing we &apos;ve found in the gallup survey is a number that we didn &apos;t expect to find .
we found this in terms of happiness itself .
if we looked at how feelings interact with income .
and it turns out , under a income of 60,000 dollars a year , for americans , and this is a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a big representative sample , under a income of 600,000 dollars a year .
60,000 .
dk : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars a year , people are unhappy , and they become increasingly happier , the poorer they become .
we get an absolutely flat line on this .
i mean , i rarely saw that flat lines .
what happens is obviously that money doesn &apos;t bring a positive happiness , but lack of money for money , and we can measure this misery very , very clearly .
in the sense of self , memory itself , you get another story .
the more money you deserve , the more you make .
it &apos;s not for emotion .
but danny , throughout america , it &apos;s about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
if people take that seriously seriously , i mean , it seems to be all on the head , everything we believe in terms of tax policy and so on .
is there a chance that politicians , that the country would generally take a sense of how seriously would we take and build politics ?
dk : you know , i think there are credit for the role of literacy research in politics .
the recognition will be slowly in the united states , not a question , but in the united kingdom , it &apos;s happening right now , and it &apos;s happening in other countries .
people are to realize that they should think of happiness when they think about politics .
it &apos;s going to take a while , and people will discuss whether they want to study experience happiness or whether they want to study life review , so we need to get this discussion pretty soon .
as you can be lucky , it &apos;s very different from how you think and whether you think about it or whether you think about the living self .
this is going to affect politics , i think .
in the united states , you get to measure the experience happiness of the population .
that will be , i think , in the next one or two of the national statistics .
now , it seems to me , this topic , or should be at least the most interesting political debate to track over the next few years .
thank you for the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you , danny kahneman .
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal . i shoot video games .
i &apos;ve been developing online games for 10 years , and my goal for the next decade is to make it easy to save the world in the reality of how they play online games .
i have a plan for this . i want to convince you more people , including all of them , spend more time with the game of play and large games .
we currently spend three billion hours a week playing online games .
some of you might think , &quot; this is a lot of time for games . &quot;
maybe too much time you think about how many problems we really have to solve in the real world .
but in fact , my research at the institute for the future is exactly the opposite .
three billion hours a week , not nearly enough to solve the most urgent problems of the world .
in fact , i &apos;m convinced that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to increase this time dramatically .
i &apos;ve calculated that the needed time for 21 billion hours of play is a week .
this may happen first , which is , again , i can make it work : if we like problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflict and obesity , i think we need to try and play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week .
no , i mean really serious .
why ? this picture describes quite exactly why i believe games are so essential for survival of human species in the future . seriously .
this is a portrait of the photographers phil toledano .
he wanted to capture the feelings in games , so he set up a camera .
this is one of the classic expressions in play .
if you &apos;re not a player , you might have some of the nuances in this picture .
you can probably see this kind of urgency for urgency , something fear , but also the first concentration of concentration , a really difficult problem to solve .
if you &apos;re also playing , you &apos;re seeing some nuances here , looking up , and the mouth is a sign of optimism . the eyebrows are surprised .
this is a player who stands at the edge of what we call the epgical seal .
oh , you know that . ok . prima . so we have some players here .
a epic victory is a result that is so extreme that they didn &apos;t even know it was possible at all .
it was walking beyond imagination .
and if you do it , you &apos;re shocked to actually be able to do this . that &apos;s a epic victory .
this player is just a epic victory .
and this is what we have to see on millions of faces of probleerness around the world , if we take the barriers of the next century in attack , the face of the people who are following all expendrities on the edge of a epic .
well , unfortunately , we &apos;re going to see this face in real life when we face difficult problems .
i call it the &quot; in life &quot; i &apos;m bad , and it &apos;s actually my face , you see ? yes ? ok ?
that &apos;s what i &apos;m like to do in life , i &apos;m bad .
this is a graffiti in my former home in berkeley , california , where i studied in my ph.d. why we are in games better than in the real life .
this is a problem that many players have .
we think we &apos;re not as good in the reality as playing .
and i don &apos;t mean just less , although that &apos;s what it belongs .
we reach more . i mean , in relation to motivation , something significant to do , inspired collaboration with each other .
if we are in a game world , i believe that many of us are going to turn into our best version anytime and immediately ready to solve the problem , trying to solve the problem as long as necessary .
and in reality , if we fail to get failure , we often feel different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel defeated . we feel threatened , maybe depressed , frustrated or zynic .
we never have these feelings when we play games , there &apos;s just no way you can .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to study as a ph.d. .
why is it possible in games to think , you couldn &apos;t just do anything ?
how can we transmit these feelings from play into reality ?
so i looked at games like world of warcraft , which offers the ideal environment to the collaborative problem .
and i found some things that make the epic gains in online worlds .
so , first of all , if you get into one of these online games , especially in world of warcraft , there &apos;s a lot of different characters that are willing to trust them , and that &apos;s immediately .
but not just any mission , but a mission that fits perfectly to your current level , right ?
so they create that .
you never get a job that you can &apos;t solve .
but always on the edge of their capabilities , they have to be tough , but there &apos;s no unemployment in the world of warcraft .
you don &apos;t sit around and you turn around . there &apos;s always something important to do .
and there &apos;s a staff of staff .
where they also go , hundreds of thousands of people working with them to pursue their epic mission .
we don &apos;t have that so easy in life , this sense that in a finger , you &apos;re willing to pay attention to a finger .
also , there &apos;s this epic story , this inspirational story , why we are there and what we have to do .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
you &apos;ve heard of &quot; level high &quot; and &quot; + 1 strength &quot; or &quot; + 1 intelligence . &quot;
this constant feedback is not in real life .
if i leave that stage , i don &apos;t speak : + 1 , and bill 1 &apos;s idea , + 20 insane idea .
i don &apos;t get in the real life of this feedback .
so , the problem of cooperative online worlds like the world of warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying to stand at any time at the edge of a epic seal that we spend all the time in these games .
they &apos;re just better than reality .
until today , all the world of warcraces have spent 5.0,000 million years to solve the virtual problems of apenoth .
that &apos;s not necessarily something bad .
it may sound nasty .
but to see it in context , 5.93 million years ago , our first primatic ancestors began to go .
so the first most exciting primate .
ok , so if we talk about how much time we &apos;re going to play with games , it just makes sense when you think of time in terms of scale of human development , which is extraordinary .
but also , because it turns out we &apos;re using all the time to play this whole time , actually change what we are as humans in the situation .
we &apos;re developing to collaborative , very famous creatures .
that &apos;s the truth . i believe that .
consider this interesting statistic , which was published recently from a researcher of carnegie mellon university : the average boy of today in a country has spent 10,000 hours of time playing online to the 21st years of online play .
so , 10,000 hours is a very interesting number of reasons .
first of all , for kids in the united states , 10.080 hours are the exact same that they spend in school , from fifth grade to high school -- if you never miss it .
so we have a complete parallel approach here , on the young people as well as learning what it means to be a good player , like everything else you learn in school .
and maybe some of you have the new book of malcolm gladwell , &quot; overflick . &quot;
so you know his theory of success , the theory of the success of the 10,000 hours .
it &apos;s based on the great research of cognitive science , that if we spend 10,000 hours with the pest study of any subject to the 21st years of life , we &apos;ll be sitting in it .
we &apos;re going to be so good at what is the most important people in the world .
so , what we have here is a whole generation of young people who are masters players .
so the big question is , &quot; what exactly are players great ? &quot;
because if we could figure that out , we &apos;d sort of never have ever been there before unprecedented human potential .
so many people are currently in the world who spend at least one hour per day with online play .
these are our masterers . 500 million people who are extraordinary in &quot; something . &quot;
and in the next decade , we have another billion players who are extraordinary in whatever .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
the business industry developed , which is saving energy and working on mobile phones , instead of broadband internet , so that player in the world , especially in india , can play china online .
you would expect an extra billion players in the next decade .
so we have a billion plus players .
so i started thinking about what it is to tell us what these games are .
here are the four things that i found . first of all , deprivation optimism .
ok , so imagine how extreme self-motivated .
manipument optimism is the desire to do something , to be able to put a barriers together , with the belief that we have a aspiration of success .
players always believe that a epic victory is possible , and it &apos;s always worth trying to do it , and it &apos;s the same .
players don &apos;t sit around .
players are masters of social networks .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting studies that we &apos;re showing people , more after we &apos;ve been playing with them , even when they &apos;re miserable .
the reason is that it requires a lot of trust to play with someone .
we trust that someone has spent time with us that the rules are going to have the same goal , that we have the same goal , and to the end of the game .
so , this is allowing the play of binary , trust and one .
as a result , we build stronger social relationships .
happy productivity . fantastic !
you know , there &apos;s a reason why the average word of warcraces is 22 hours a week , as a piece of time .
the reason is , when we play , we &apos;re actually happier at working hard when we relax or nothing .
we know that as human beings are optimal , when we do hard , significant work .
and players are always ready to work if they get the right job .
and finally , epic meaning .
players love to be part of awe of improvisation of corruption .
here &apos;s a back dinformation to put this in the right light , and you know all wikipedia , the biggest wiki of the world .
the second wiki of the world , almost 80,000 copies of the world , is the world of warcraft wiki .
five million people use it every month .
they put more information on the world of warcraft on the internet than any other wiki in the world .
they create a epic story .
they create a epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , so these are four superpowers that lead to a single outcome . players are super-powerful , hopeful individuals .
it &apos;s people who believe that they can change the world .
and the only problem is they believe they can change the virtual worlds , but not the real .
that &apos;s the problem i try to solve .
edward castronova is a prime scientist .
his work is great . he studied why people spend so much time , energy and money in online worlds .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re going to be witnessing not less than a mass mass in virtual worlds and online game environments . &quot;
and that &apos;s an economist . so he &apos;s logical .
and he says ...
not like i &apos;m -- i develop games , i &apos;m a little bit overmark .
so he says that actually makes sense , because players can achieve more online than in real life .
you can engage stronger social bonds than in real life . you get more feedback and reward in play than in real life .
so , he says it &apos;s perfectly logical that players spend more time in virtual world than in the real world .
i first agree that this is logical .
but it &apos;s definitely not an optical situation .
we need to start turning the real world into a game .
my inspiration comes from one event , which is 2,500 years .
there &apos;s this antiny cube , of sheep &apos;s worth of sheep . you know ?
before that fantastic game controllers , there were sheep &apos;s lacats .
and these were kind of the first of people who were developed play devices .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the works of the ancient greek historian , you might know this story . the story about how and why games were invented .
according to herodotus , games were made , more specifically , in the kingdom of being invented during famine during famine .
there was such a massive famine that the king of lydies decided to make a crazy idea .
people suffered . people fought .
it was an extreme situation . it took a extreme solution .
so they invented , according to herodotus , the box game , and they put a national strategy . one day you would eat . the next day you would play .
and you &apos;d be able to play so much into the box , because you &apos;re so fascinating , and you &apos;re with satisfying , happy productivity that you would forget that there was nothing to eat .
and then the next day you would play . and the next day you would eat .
and according to herodotus , they survived these famine for 18 years by eating a day and played on the next .
well , i think we &apos;re going to play a game today .
we use games to escape the suffering of the real world .
we put games in order to get out of everything that doesn &apos;t work in the real world , which is not very satisfying in real life , and we &apos;re getting what we need from play .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
that &apos;s the exciting thing .
according to herodotus , after 18 years , famine was not better , so the king of the game decided to put in the last page .
they shared the kingdom in two camps .
they played a box game , and they were allowed to break up a epic adventure .
they left lygers and they went to search for a new home . they just let so many people go back to the survival of food , and they were looking for the rest of a region where they could flourish .
that sounds crazy , right ?
but latest dna evidence shows that the etrus , which later the roman empire , the same dna , the same dna as the old ones .
so scientists recently came to believe that herodotus is actually wrong .
and geologists found evidence of global warming , which took almost 20 years to explain famine .
so this crazy story could vote .
you may actually have saved your people through play by having 18 years in games , and then they had the interaction and so much learned about the idea that they &apos;ve saved the entire civilization .
so , we can also .
we &apos;ve been playing in 1994 since 1994 .
this was the first strategy in real time in the world of warcraces , and that was 16 years ago .
they were playing for 18 years , and we &apos;ve been playing investor for 16 years .
i mean , we &apos;re ready for our own epic game .
so , they sent half of their civilization to search for a new world , so i take my 21 billion play a week .
we should be overincome that half of us spend an hour per day with play , until we solved the problems of real world .
i know you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; how do we solve problems of real world games ? &quot; and exactly that question , i &apos;ve dedicated my job to the future for the future .
we have this banner in our office in palo alto , the way we should understand the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to tell the future before .
what we want is to create the future .
we want to think of the best result of the best thing , and then people enforce this idea into reality .
we put epic gains and give people the opportunity to reach them .
i &apos;m going to show you very briefly three games that i &apos;ve designed to try and get people to get destructive gains in their own future .
this is &quot; the world without oil . &quot;
the game is from 2007 .
it &apos;s an online game where you have to overcome an oil shortage .
the oil scarcity is invented , but we have enough online content so that it becomes realistic for you , and it really lives without oil . so , if you &apos;re going to play it , you &apos;re going to tell us where you &apos;re going to live . and you &apos;re going to be able to figure out how much oil is going to be . and then you &apos;re going to be able to figure out how much oil is going to be . and then you &apos;re going to be able to figure out how much
we tested this game with 1,700 players in 2007 , and we &apos;ve been accompanied by the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was a transformative experience .
nobody wants to change their life because it &apos;s good for the environment or because we should .
but if you &apos;re in a epic adventure , and you say , &quot; the oil comes out . &quot;
this is a fascinating adventure to go to .
find out how they would survive . most of our players are taking advantage of behaviors in the game .
so for the next part of the game , we have a bigger , higher goal than just oil scarcity .
we &apos;ve developed &quot; superstruct ct &quot; on the institute of the future for the future .
the computation of a supercomputer is that people only have 23 years on the planet .
this supercomputer is called &quot; global judgment , &quot; which is , of course , .
the call to the player , to pick up , we have almost like a &quot; jerry-bruater &quot; film .
you know jerry bruckry movies where it &apos;s called the &quot; suram-team . &quot; they have the astronauts , the ex-laureates , and they can save the world .
but in our game , instead of just five people , we say , everyone is in the audible team , and it &apos;s our job for energy , food , health , security and the future of social justice .
8,000 players played the game eight weeks .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that they can read when they google &quot; superstruct ct . &quot;
and the last game we get is the third of march . it &apos;s a game in collaboration with the world bank .
if you finish the game , you get the world bank , the &quot; social resection &quot; of 2010 .
we work with universities all over sub-saharan africa , and we have a social redesigning .
we have a comic book . we have &quot; level high &quot; for local understanding knowledge , sustainability , vision and imagination .
i &apos;d like to invite you all to share this game with young people everywhere in the world , especially in development areas that are going to benefit from their own social enterprise to save the world .
i come to the end .
i want to ask you something .
what do you think happens next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t saved the real world .
well , i hope you agree with me that players are human resources that we can apply to work in real life , and that games have a great meaning for change .
we have this whole superpowers , blisty productivity , the ability to bring close social networks , penetposing optimism and the desire for epic meaning .
i really hope that we play significant games together to survive on this planet .
and i hope you &apos;ll design with me and play with me .
when i look at the next decade , i &apos;m sure about two things that we can create each future , and that we can play all kinds of games .
so i say , let &apos;s start changing the world changing games !
thank you .
i &apos;d like to tell you a little bit about what i saw a few months in the writing of a laparowired .
i &apos;ve always been willing to write my synony-dictionary , and i was ready to work with the texture , and i noticed that i &apos;ve never been struck in my life , what the word &quot; disabled &quot; means .
i read you the post .
&quot; disabled , &quot; perjectively , &quot; shated , helpless , useless , destroyed , cloned , slipped , slipped , shoubled , unpotent , unpotent , unpotent , tacked , unpotent , unpotent , unpotent , unpotent , unpotent , unpotent .
antonyme : healthy , strong , powerful .
i &apos;ve read this list of a friend according to a friend of mine , and i had to laugh , it was so ridiculous , but i just came up to say , &quot; and i didn &apos;t have to talk anymore , and i didn &apos;t have to go to reading , first of all . &quot;
of course , this was a grown old , old synonym dictionary , and i just thought that the output must be pretty old .
but in fact , it was a copy on the early &apos; 80s when i started with elementary school and began to build my own self outside of my family &apos;s family , and form it in terms of other kids and the rest of the world around me .
and thanks to god , i didn &apos;t use synonyan dictionary .
if i would take this post seriously , i would be born into a world that someone like me would perceive as one person , whose life could be positive in any way , but i &apos;m going to have the opportunity and adventure that i &apos;ve experienced .
so i immediately called the online copy of 2009 , and i expected to find out that i &apos;m going to give you a proxy .
here &apos;s the current version of this compound .
it &apos;s not much better than that .
in particular , the last two words , i think , under &quot; near antonyms &quot; and &quot; healthy . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about words .
it &apos;s about what we think about people that we describe with these words .
it &apos;s about values in those words , and how we construct these values .
our language affects our thinking and how we see the world and people around us .
a lot of aging societies , including the greeks and the roman , have really believed that the language of a flight is a big force , because what you &apos;re talking about , you can also manifest .
so , what do we actually want to manifest -- a disabled people or a powerful person ?
it &apos;s just a people who have lost eight-than a child , and they could discount them , and give them beliefs .
wouldn &apos;t it be beautiful to open your doors to open up ?
a man who has opened up for me was my pediatrician at a.i. dupont institute in burma .
it &apos;s called dr. pizzus . an italo-american , whose name , as you can think of , most americans couldn &apos;t speak correctly . so he &apos;s always called dr. p. .
and dr. p. wore always very colorful flies and was just created for the work with kids .
i found the time i spent in this hospital just great -- to my physical therapy .
i had to repeat some of the exercises of infinite times with these heavy , elastic changes -- in different colors -- you know , to build my leg muscles , and i hated these tags more than anything . i hated them . i hated them . i hated them .
and imagine , i even have a five-year-old child with dr. p. veris , and so i tried to stop this practice , natural leless without success .
and one day , he looked at me at one of my exercisations -- these are just tiring , and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re a powerful , powerful and young girl , you &apos;re going to tear one one day .
and if you make it , i give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
that was just a simple trick , of course , by dr. p. , so i do the work that i didn &apos;t want to do with the prospect that the richest five year-old girls in the hospital are going to be in the second floor , but he actually got me to see my everyday horror .
and i &apos;m going to ask you , how much his vision of me as a strong and powerful girl has shaped my own picture , and i could imagine myself as one of nature , powerful , powerful and breathorable man .
this is just an example of many , like adults can stimulate the imagination of a child .
but like the examples of the synonystan dictionaries , our language makes us not a room , to imagine something that we would all wish to be able to see .
our language is raising the social change in many cases through a technological change .
from the medical standpoint of view , of course , you can say that my legs , the laser surgery for visually disabilities , ksweet joints of titan and the artificial hip for aging , that will allow people to be able to be able to define their own .
so , perhaps this technology change is clear because ever that there was always a different truth , which is that every human society can give something special and very powerful , and that the human capacity , to adapt , is our biggest plus .
the human ability to adapt -- that &apos;s an interesting story , because people are always asking me to talk about how to deal with widridities and i &apos;m going to feel a little bit like this : this sentence has never been fit for me , and i &apos;ve always felt very uncomfortable , and i &apos;ve always felt it .
this sentence from using widrities lives from the idea that success or happiness depends on the challenge to be a challenge without being directed by the experience of the experience .
but the truth is that we are changing . of course we are confronted by the challenge , whether they &apos;re physically , emotionally or emotionally .
and i &apos;m saying that &apos;s good .
widridities are not a barrier that we have to turn around to get better with our lives .
widridies are just to our lives .
and i tend to go out and see my shadow .
sometimes i realize he &apos;s very present , sometimes he &apos;s hardly seen , but he &apos;s constantly in me .
and i mean , i don &apos;t want the impact or the heavy of the fight of a human being .
there &apos;s life in life , and challenges , and these are just real and every person doing it differently , but the question is not whether we &apos;re going to end up with widrity .
so we &apos;re not just responsible for the people we love to keep in front of people we love , but they were ready to get good at that .
and we don &apos;t like our children if we give them the feeling that they cannot adapt .
you have to separate two things : to be a medical fact , to be amputated and the social opinion about whether i &apos;m disabled or not .
and to be honest , the only real and lead disability i had to take apart is that the world is always meant to describe me with these definitions .
in our wish to protect people who are alive and telling them the cool , hard truth about their medical forecast , or even a forecast to the quality of life they expect , we need to pay attention to that we don &apos;t have to be disabled .
maybe the concept of the concept is that just watch what &apos;s going on in a broken , and how we repair it for every single one more disability than the pathology .
if we treat a human being , and not all its forces and possibilities , and recognize , we can also create the natural struggle that you might have to lead to , another disease .
we have a people who have value for our society .
so we have to look beyond the patology and focus on all the human possibilities .
but most importantly , it &apos;s between perception of our flaws and our great creative minds , one connection .
we shouldn &apos;t dismiss these times , or denial , we should not try to avoid them , we should try to avoid them under the carpet , but it &apos;s about figuring out the amount of opportunities .
it may be more clear to me to make sure that we don &apos;t necessarily need to have access to it , but that we are open to hug them , to put them on the sjf , and maybe actually dance with it .
and maybe we can do it , widrity as something natural , consistent and useful , and feel like this , not so much as so polluized .
in this year , we celebrate the 200 . birthday of charles darwin and when he wrote about evolution 150 years ago , darwin , in my eyes , on something very real human character .
i would write it like this : not the most powerful of his kind , and not the most intelligent of his kind , but the one that can adapt to the best .
conflict creates creativity .
not only from darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability to survive , to survive and contaminate , is determined by the fight of the human spirit .
so again , change and adaptation are the greatest skills of people .
and maybe we only know what wood we &apos;re rotating in , if we really get tested .
maybe that &apos;s the point of widriance , an perceptions of the iar , a sense of our own power .
we can give ourselves something like this .
we can give a new meaning that goes beyond severe times .
maybe we can see didridities as change .
widridities are a change that we haven &apos;t yet adapted to .
i think the biggest damage we &apos;ve added to ourselves is to believe that we should be normal .
honestly , who is normal ?
there &apos;s no normal .
there are the usual . the typical . but not the normal . and would you like to know those poor , gray person , if you really existed ?
i think it &apos;s not .
it would be great if we think of this paradigm of normality to another of the possibilities , or the strength to even be a little dangerous , exchange that we can put in the forces of very many children , and invite them to bring their own special and valuable skills to society .
stereotypes have found that we have people from the members of our society , to be useful , to be useful and to contribute .
there are evidence that the neanderthals have already carried older years ago and people with severe physical injuries , and that might happen because the life experience in the survival of these people is valuable .
they don &apos;t have these people as broken and useless ; they were treated as something special and valuable .
a few years ago , i went to the city where i grew up in a food market in which the red zone was in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i stood there in front of a disagreement tomatoes .
it was summer and i had hurts .
and i hear how a guy behind me says , &quot; well , if that &apos;s not aimee mullins . &quot;
and i turn around and see the old man . i had no idea who he is .
and i said , &quot; excuse me , sir , we know ? i can &apos;t remember them . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , you might barely remember me .
when i first saw her , i took her out of the belly of her mother . &quot;
oh , so that .
and of course , it made click .
this was dr. kean , a man i knew only from narratives of my mother about this day because i was , of course , very typical , to my birthday two weeks .
the doctor for pringer diagnosis of my mother was in vacation , and so my parents knew the man who brought me to the world at all .
and because i was born without any legs , and my feet were looking at them , and i just got a few toes on the other hand and a few toes on the other foot , and he had to overtake the bad news .
he said to me , &quot; i had to tell her parents that you would never walk , and never be able to be like other kids , or that you could never have been an independent life . &quot;
i was really interested in the fact that he had collected newspaper cuts of my childhood , whether i had won in a letter competition in the second grade , whether i was at the bottom of the parade , whether i had my scholarship , and he used to use these outmarks to teach his students to teach medical school students , and he used to use these cuts to teach their students .
and he called this part the x factor , the potential of the human being .
you can &apos;t emphasize enough how critical this factor of a human being can be .
and dr. kean told him , he said , &quot; i &apos;ve learned that kids , if they didn &apos;t get anything else , and even when they get a little bit of support , they can get a lot of money . &quot;
see , dr. kean has changed his mind .
he understood that medical diagnosis , and how someone could deal with it , two different things .
and i &apos;ve also changed my thinking of time when you asked me in the age of 15 , whether i would have exchange my prostheses against meat and bone , then i wouldn &apos;t have missed a second .
i really wanted to be normal .
if you ask me this today , i &apos;m not sure .
and that &apos;s because i &apos;ve experienced something with my legs and not despite this experience .
and maybe this change could happen , because i &apos;ve come up with so many people who have opened my doors , rather than to meet people who are restricting me or i wanted to have an idea .
you see , it really takes a person who shows you how they can manifest their forces , and they &apos;re through .
if you allow somebody to activate your own inner forces , the human mind is so empirictive -- if you do that , and you open a door for someone in a critical moment , you &apos;re a very good teacher .
they bring them to open their doors .
the real meaning of the word &quot; cloudce &quot; in the word &quot; goose ce . &quot;
it means something creates , you know , in one is to tickle the potential .
again , what potential are we going to call ?
in the 1960s , the u.k. did a case study , and then the students were transformed in big schools at the time .
they call this &quot; dig clinical states &quot; in the u.s. we call &quot; tracking . &quot;
students are going to open up grades .
and the a student will publish coins harder , get the better teachers so .
they then have over a three-month period of time students with a &quot; sufficient &quot; the grade &quot; very well . &quot; they said they were out of line that they were very smart , and after those three months they really wrote it .
and of course , it breaks to hear the heart that the other students were told , they &apos;re only enough .
and in the same way , it was after three months .
but only those who are still in school -- except from the students , the school they had failed .
the other thing about this study was that the teachers were not balanced .
teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
they were just told that the students and those are the students who are enough , and they &apos;ve taught them something and they &apos;re treating them .
the only real disability is a broken mind , a mind that has been broken , doesn &apos;t have any hope anymore . he doesn &apos;t find anything more beautiful . he lacked our natural , chilous ability of imagination .
if we can do it , to support the human spirit , to continue to hope , and other people around you are beautiful to be curious , and then we &apos;re going to have our forces really , really positive .
when a mind has about these qualities , we can create a new reality and new notation .
i &apos;d like to end with a poem that was written by an persian poster called hafiz in the 14th century , and my friend jacques erbois told me , and that poem is called &quot; the god who knows only four words , not the god of the name , not the god of the name , not the god of the name , not the god of the name , not the god of the names , not the god . &quot;
come on , dance with me . thank you .
how would you want to be better than you &apos;re right now ?
suppose i said that through a few changes of their genes , a better memory could have -- more precise and faster .
or you want to be a fitter , stronger force .
do you want to become attractive and confident ?
how would it be to live longer in good health ?
or maybe they &apos;re one of those who are always more creativity for more creativity .
which one would you like most ?
which one would you like to have if you could have one ?
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see .
a few . probably about as many as the creative people here are .
that &apos;s very good .
how many would have been deciding for a good memory ?
some more .
how about fitness ?
a few less .
what about longevity ?
ah , the majority . this is what i like to see as a doctor .
if you could have one of them , it would be a very different world .
is it all intereducation ?
or is it possible perhaps ?
evolution has been an ongoing issue here on the ted conference , but today i want to give you the view of a doctor &apos;s subject .
the big genetic in the 20th century , t.gs dobzhansky , who was also an communist in the russian orthodox church , once wrote a sentence called &quot; nothing in biology . &quot;
well , if you &apos;re one of those who don &apos;t accept the proof of the biological evolution , that would be a very good time to turn out your hearing device , you &apos;re going to take your personal devices -- i &apos;ll give you the permission and maybe you &apos;re going to take a look at kathryn school &apos;s book -- i &apos;ll give you a look at kathryn schultz .
but if you accept biological evolution , you think about this : is it just about the past , or is it going to be about the future ?
is it for others , or is it affecting us ?
this is another view of the tree of life .
in this picture , i &apos;ve put a bush as a center of the branches in all directions , because if you look at the edges of life , all relative to the top of these branches have succeeded in evolutionary terms : they have survived ; it survives ; it survives ; it survives .
the human part of this box , far at the end , is , of course , what we &apos;re most interested in .
we &apos;re two from a common ancestor to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago .
in this period , perhaps 20 or 25 different species of hominids .
some are come and left .
we &apos;ve been here for about 130,000 years .
it seems like we &apos;re quite remote from the other parts of life , but in fact , the main part is the fundamental mechanisms of our cells pretty much .
is it clear that we can use it , and the mechanisms of a common bacteria can be implanted to produce the protein of the human insulin , which is used to treat diabetics ?
this is not like human insulin ; this is the same protein that &apos;s chemically inconsistent from what comes out of the burning .
and while we &apos;re talking about bacteria , you realize that every one of us in our gut makes more bacteria than it is in the rest of our bodies ?
maybe 10 times .
i mean , do you think when antonio damasio asks her self-picture , think about the bacteria ?
our gut is a wonderful hospitlative environment for these bacteria .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s delicious , it &apos;s very comfortable .
and you &apos;re all going to give you all nutrients that you might wish to do without effort .
it &apos;s a really easier way to use bacteria , with random subtrandness of unintended tunnelation , in jeodesday , to the outcome .
but otherwise , they &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria , just like they &apos;re important for their lives .
they help digestion essential nutrients , and they protect them against certain diseases .
but what will happen in the future ?
are we in a kind of evolutionary equilibrium in a species of species ?
or are we determined to be something else -- something that may even be adapted to the environment ?
now , let &apos;s go back to the time of the big bang , 14 trillion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years ago -- the first signs of living , maybe three to four billion years ago -- and then the human species , which is in the last 130,000 years .
in this huge uncomplete symphony of the universe , life on earth is only very short measure ; the animal kingdom , like a single individual , and the human life , a small twist .
we were .
this is also the entertainment value of this speech , so i hope you &apos;ve liked it .
well , when i was a neuling on college , i had my first biology class .
i was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology .
i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i figured out something very fundamental : in most of the existence of life in single-certain organisms , every cell , and all the genetic information of the cell is going to continue in both tofu cells .
but at the time , as a number of organisms , things began to change .
sexual reproduction goes into the picture .
and very importantly , with the introduction of sexual reproduction , the genome will continue , the rest of the body becomes deprivation .
in fact , you could say that the inevitable of the death of our body is emerging in the same moment as sexual reproduction .
now i have to say , if i was a college student , i thought , okay , sex / death , sex / death , death for sex -- it seemed to be pretty reasonable at the time , but with every year , it &apos;s gone to my higher question .
i &apos;ve come to understand the feelings of george burns , who took his show in vegas in las vegas .
and one night , there &apos;s a pat on his hotel room .
he opens the door .
in front of him , he &apos;s a beautiful conjever showgirl .
she looks at him and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for super sex . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s wonderful , &quot; says george , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the soup . &quot;
i came to the realization that i was going to work with a goal that was different than the goal of evolution -- not inevitable , just different .
i tried to preserve the body .
i wanted to keep healthy .
i wanted to rebuild health to a disease .
i wanted to have a long and healthy life .
evolution is all about the continuing of the genome to the next generation , adaptation and survival generation after generation .
from a evolutionary standpoint , they are , and i like booster rockets to send the genetic fractal to the next level of orbit , then to fall into the sea .
i think we would all have the mood , the woody to understand the expression , when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to get rid of my work .
i want to do it by not dying . &quot;
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily mean the longest life .
it doesn &apos;t necessarily be the biggest , the most powerful or the fastest , and not even the smartest .
evolution dominated the creatures that are best to adapt to their environment .
it &apos;s just the test of survival and success .
on the bottom of the ocean , bacteria are there that are thermophihihil , and therefore the hot bird survive , otherwise if fish would be there , they would have a vacuum to make a licable environment for themselves .
so , what does that mean when we look back at what &apos;s happening in evolution , and how we think about the space of people in evolution , and particularly how we predict the next phase , i would say that there are a series of possibilities .
the first one is we &apos;re not going to move forward .
we have a kind of balance .
and the reason for this would be that the first thing we did was to preserve a lot of genes that had otherwise been selected and made out of the population .
and secondly , we as a spegue of our environment so that we &apos;ve been able to make it adapt to us , and we adapt to them .
and by the way , we wander and cuts and mix so much that they can &apos;t say that isolation is necessary for the evolution to find out .
a second possibility is that it will be a evolution of traditional species , of course , the forces of nature .
and the argument , here would be the wheels of evolution slowly , but they are unpleasant .
and so far as isolation goes away as a species planet , it will be isolated and the changes of the environment that can produce evolution in a natural way .
but there is a third possibility , a pressing , fascinating and scary possibility .
i call it a neo-evolution -- the new development that isn &apos;t just , but i decided , and decided , as individuals , in decisions that we make .
now , how did this happen ?
how could it be possible that we do this ?
let &apos;s first look at reality that people are making decisions about their offspring .
they are , in some cultures , the choice to have more men than women .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family decide .
so think of it , if it &apos;s not just possible to choose your child &apos;s gender , but to deliver genetic adaptations that heal disease and prevent the disease .
what if you could make the genetic changes to get diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s disease or decrease cancer risk or stroke ?
wouldn &apos;t you want to do it in your genes ?
when we predict , these kinds of changes will be increasingly possible .
the human genome project began in 1990 , and it took 13 years .
it cost 2.7 billion dollars .
in the following year , when 2004 was done , they could do the same thing for 20 million dollars in dra .
today , you can have a sequence of three billion bases of human genome to a price of about $ 20,000 and in the space of about a week .
it will not take long , until the reality will be that there will be 1,000 dollars of human genomes , and it will be increasingly available for everyone .
a week ago , the national academy of engineering was the draper prize for francis arnold and wilbright stemmer , two scientists who developed independent techniques to work faster and to work in an efficient way , which encourage the natural process of evolution to work faster and more complex proteins .
a few years ago , the laser prize was named shinya yamanaka for his research in which he took a adult voice , a fibrososte , and through the manipulation of just four genes , the cell activates to be able to get it to a pluripotent stem cell .
these changes are coming .
the same technology that can produce the human insulin in bacteria , viruses that are not only protection , but can serve the immununity against other viruses .
whether you believe it or not , it &apos;s an experimental study in the gang with immunization that &apos;s been built in the cells of a tobacco plant .
can you imagine something good from spreak ?
this is all reality today , and the future will be much more possible .
and then just ask two other little changes .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells of your offspring ?
what if you could change the sperm and the cells or the fresh egg to be able to make a better chance for a healthier life -- decrease the diabetes of the diabetes ?
who doesn &apos;t want to be healthier kids ?
and then the analytic technique , the same engine of science that can allow the changes to prevent disease to prevent disease , could also allow us to deny super-conductors .
why don &apos;t we have the ability of a ken jennings , especially if you can expand it with the next generation of the horse machine ?
why not have the fast muscle fibers that allow them to walk faster and longer ?
why not live longer ?
these are inconsistent .
and if we &apos;re in a place where we can pass it to the next generation , and we can do the characteristics that we want to be transformed , we will be transformed by scale style to evolution .
we &apos;re going to have a process that is potentially 100,000 years , and we can do it in a thousand years -- and maybe even the next 100 years .
these are decisions that their grandchildren , or their grandchildren , have to be run .
do we use these decisions to form society that &apos;s better , that &apos;s more friendly ?
or will we selectively choose different attributes that we want to have for some of us , not for others ?
are we going to be able to form a society , and see unidents , or more robust and more robust ?
these are the kinds of questions that we &apos;re going to face .
and most of all , are we ever going to be able to develop the wisdom , and the wisdom that we need to be able to make these decisions ?
in the good way , in the evil , and before you think , these decisions are about us .
thank you .
i want you to now imagine something that gives you a portable robot that gives you human skills , or a different that helps you to stand up and go up again .
we call this robots in berkeley bionics .
they &apos;re not other than something that they put in the morning and gives them additional strength and increase their speed , and that will help them keep their balance .
this is indeed the true glove of man and machine .
but not only that -- to merge and connect with the universe and other devices out there .
it &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
now to show you what we &apos;re working on , we start talking about the american soldiers , which is about 100 pounds on its back , and it &apos;s the question that they should carry more equipment .
of course , this leads to some major complications -- spinal injuries , 30 percent of it -- chronic spinal injuries .
so we thought we would embrace this challenge and create an exotic skeleton that would help deal with this problem .
so let me introduce you to now now -- or the human universal adhrier .
soldier : with the hulc exotic skeleton , i can carry 200 pounds across different kinds of terrain .
his flexible design allows it to swallow deeply , to warrior and get very limited movements .
it feels what i want to do , where i want to go , and then move my strength and out .
we &apos;re as far as our industrial partners to imagine this device , this new exotic skeleton in this year .
so it &apos;s true .
now let &apos;s take our view of the wheelheads , something that i &apos;m particularly passionate about .
there are 68 million people who are estimated worldwide in the wheelchair .
it &apos;s about one percent of the population .
and that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate .
we &apos;re often talking about very young people with spinal injuries , which are in their lifetime of their lives -- 20it , &apos; 30s , &apos; 40s , and the wheelchair is the only option .
but it &apos;s also about aging population , the number of multiplied .
and so pretty much the only option -- if it comes to a brain drop , or other complications -- is the wheelchair .
and by the way , it &apos;s been 500 years since he said , very successful introduction .
so we thought we could start to write a completely new chapter of mobility .
now let me introduce you to an eleganle that was carried by amanda boxes , which was a spinal cord injury in 19 years , which has no longer been going to run since 19 years and now .
thank you .
as i said , amanda carries our elegangs .
it has sensors .
his completely non-invasive sensors in the crutches sending signals back to our onboard computer , which is attached to their back .
there are also a trends , the motor engine , which is the motor drive , as well as on their knees , that move forward into this pretty smooth and very natural bow .
i was 24 years old , and i was in the form , as a monamous purcet tree as a ski ride .
in a fraction of a second , i lost every feeling and every movement below my beard .
not long after that , a doctor in my hospital and he said , &quot; amanda , you &apos;ll never go back . &quot;
and that was 19 years ago .
he &apos;s got steel every five of the hope from my consciousness .
adaptable technology since then has been able to go to learning to ski , climb and ride with the hands .
but nothing was invented to me again , until now .
thank you .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to meet and discuss with them .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we have all the potential here to change life from future generations -- not just for the soldiers , or for amanda , but all of them .
thank you .
at home in new york , i &apos;m the ceo of the developing development department called robin hood .
if i haven &apos;t fought the poverty , i fought as a fireman by a fireman man at a volunteer bar .
now , in our city , in the volunteers of volunteers , we have to be trained to be very early in the face of the brand to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to .
i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunteers on fire , so i had really good opportunities to get in .
but it was still a professional pass against the other volunteers to achieve the official man , and to figure out what our jobs would be .
when i found the main man , he had just in a very serious conversation with the janitalists who certainly had one of the worst days of her life .
it was in the middle of the night and she stood in the shock train , and barking under a screen out of the dirt rain , whereas her house stood in flames .
the other volunteers who arrived in front of me -- we call him lex luther -- did the first man to go to the house , and to save the dog of the house .
the dog ! i was speaking to envy .
there was any lawyer , or assets , who now could tell for the rest of his life , to tell people that he went into a van &apos;s house , just because he was five seconds faster than i was .
well , i was the next one .
the main man , winte me .
he said , &quot; woos , you have to go to the house .
you have to go up , where the fire goes over , and you have to get some shoes up . &quot;
i swear .
now , not exactly what i hoped to do , but i went up -- the trep up , the fluar , the &quot; the real firemen &quot; that was going on at this point at the time that you could get into the bedroom around a few shoes .
i know what you &apos;re thinking , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i was wearing my prey back down to where i met my enemy and the beloved dog .
we put our treasals out to the home , where , not surprisingly , he got more attention than my .
a couple of weeks later , the fireguard was given a letter of the house , in which she beamed for her house .
one of the things that &apos;s more intuitive kindness : somebody had even got a few shoes .
both in my job at robin hood and my work as a volunteer fireman , i am witnessing from generosity and kindness in the great scale , but i also also see the love and the muts of individuals .
and you know what i learned ?
they &apos;re all important .
so if i look around in this room and see people who have either gotten a success success or a way , i want to give you a reminder of this : don &apos;t wait .
don &apos;t wait to make a difference in the life of another , until they &apos;ve reached their first million .
if you have to give something , give it up now .
put them in a food kitchen , sit down a park in the neighborhood .
be a mentor .
not every day will give us a chance to save life , but every day offers us to change one .
so they get off ; they save the shoes .
thank you .
bruno guissani : mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
i just come back from a community that knows the secret of the population of humanity .
a place where women lead the zepter , with sex , &quot; hello , &quot; and the game determines -- where fun is .
and no , it &apos;s not paranoman or san francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , their relatives .
this is the world of the wild bonobos in the ancient forest .
bonobos are together with chimpanzees our next living relatives .
that means we have a common ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago .
well , chimpanzees are known for their aggressive vidity .
but unfortunately , we &apos;ve overstated this aspect in the narrative of human evolution .
but bonobos show us the other side of the rice .
during chimpanzees of big , fear of marps , the feminine society is driven by empowerment female .
they &apos;ve really been up there , because that leads to a highly tolerant society in which the deadly violence has not been seen .
but unfortunately , bonobos are the least known among the primates .
they live in the deep of the congolese empire , and they &apos;re very difficult to see .
congo is a paradox -- a country of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of darkness itself -- the scene of a violent argument that has been developing for decades and the first world &apos;s first world war .
it doesn &apos;t surprise that these destruction are the survival of the bonobos .
meat trade and the decline of the tree is that you can &apos;t even fill a stadium with the elite bonobos -- and even there we are not safe to be honest .
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a hidden smile that feeds the trees .
who are these related ones ?
we know it as &quot; love instead of war &quot; monkeys , because they have common genes , also bisexual sex , interacting partners , and the rules and so conflicts .
i &apos;m not saying that that would be the answer to all the humanitarian problems -- because life of the bonobos is more than the camel &apos;s .
bonobos -- like humans -- love to play their lives .
play doesn &apos;t just mean child games .
for us and it &apos;s essential to the attachment of relationships and care of tolerance .
we learn to trust and the rules of the game .
game creativity is increasing creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s all about generating diversity of diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity of behaviors , diversity of compounds .
and when you watch bonobos in the game , you see the evolutionary origins of human lather , dance and ritual .
play is the tickt that holds us in .
well , i don &apos;t know how you play , but i want to show you some unique footage from the wild .
first of all , a balloon game -- and i don &apos;t think about football .
so here &apos;s a young female and males in a chase game .
look at what makes you .
that could be the evolutionary origin of : &quot; she grabs him in the eggs . &quot;
just that i think it &apos;s more like him , not true .
yeah !
so sex games are common , both bonobos and people .
and this video is really interesting , because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows the idea of how to play new elements in the game -- like the testices -- and also how the game requires both trust as well as it does .
but the game is a formal conductor .
play is a translator , and it can take a lot of forms of which some of them are quiet , objective , curious -- maybe to rediscover the amazing ones .
and i want to show you , this is fuku , a young female , and she &apos;s playing peace with water .
i think , just like you &apos;re playing , sometimes we are alone , and we look at the limit of our inner and external worlds .
and it &apos;s this playful curiosity that makes us study , and interact , and the unexpected acts that we form are the really nutrient of creativity .
this is just a little pretaste on the insights that bonobos give us in our past and present .
but they &apos;re true also a secret for our future , a future where we need to adapt to higher challenges , through greater creativity and rehabilitation cooperation .
the secret is that the game is the key to these skills .
in other words , play is our adaptive .
to adapt to a pristine world , we need to play .
but will we make the best out of our play ?
play is not silly .
it &apos;s essential .
for bonobos and people , life is not of teeth and claws alone .
if it doesn &apos;t seem to be appropriate , maybe play is at risk .
and so , my mamatenmate , let &apos;s embrace this gift of evolution and play together while we &apos;re changing the creativity of crony and the wonder .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two pairs , the middle of 1979 , at exactly the same day , in exactly the same moment , every dimension -- okay .
so two pairs , every dot one baby .
now i don &apos;t want you to use too much time to imagine , because , if you take the whole time , you won &apos;t listen to me .
imagine that just for a moment .
and in this scenario , they imagine that in a case , the sperm is wearing y chomoons that hit the x of the ice cell .
and in the other case , the sperm is a x chromosome on the x of the ice cell .
both are survival , both light .
we &apos;ll go back to these people later .
in most of my activities , i have two clubs .
under a hat , i &apos;m involved in the history of anatomy .
i &apos;m a technologist , and in this case , i study how people with anatomy went -- that human body , animal body -- how they went with body fluids , with body imaging -- how they thought about body .
the other hat i carried on my work is the activist as a patient lawyer -- or , as i say sometimes , as an impatient lawyer -- from people who are patients .
in this case , i worked with people who have the body types , asking social norms to question .
so for example , i worked with people who are siamese twins , two people in a body .
i &apos;ve been working with zwarf -- so people who were smaller than usual .
and very often , i &apos;ve been working with intersexual people whose gender is -- so people who don &apos;t have the average male or female types of language .
and as a general term , we can use the word of intersexual objective .
intersexuality matters in many different forms .
i &apos;ll just give you a few examples of the possible types of sex that are not the male or female standard .
in a case you might have somebody with a dose of payments , and the sry of the y chomosoms leaves the progonles that we &apos;ve all woryed to grow .
and that &apos;s why the testes in fetals give testosterone .
but because this individual is missing the receptors to recognize testosterone , the body doesn &apos;t respond to testosterone .
and this is called androgenham &apos;s defect .
so a lot of testosterone , but no reaction to it .
as a consequence , the body evolves more the typical female course .
if the kid is born , she looks like a girl .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s raised as girl .
but it mostly takes you to get puberty and grow your breasts and develop them , but they don &apos;t get their period , until someone &apos;s going to come here .
and they do a few tests , and they find out that instead of eizsticks and uterus , they really tein tein and they have a y chromosome .
it &apos;s important to understand that that person could actually hold this person , but they &apos;re not really .
women , like men , have something in our bodies that you call adrenalinons .
they &apos;re in the back part of our body .
and the side kidneys represent androgenic , which is virilizing hormones .
most women , like me -- i think to be a typical woman -- i don &apos;t know my actual chromosomes , but i think i &apos;ll probably have the typical -- most women like me are actually talking to androgenic .
we produce androgen and we talk to androgenic .
the consequence is that someone like me actually has a brain that was exposed to more androgenic than a woman who was born with teborn , and a androgenic recipe .
so gender is really complicated ; intersexual are not just in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in some sense , you can be distributed across the entire range .
one more example : a few years ago , i received the call of a 19 year-old man who was born as a boy , and he had a friend , he had a friend , he had sex with his girlfriend , lived with his girlfriend , living with his girlfriend .
he had a very extreme form of an original side of an animal cattle hyperbladder .
he has xx chromosome , and in the womb , his side kidneys were so active that they basically created a male hormone environment .
and as a consequence , his genitaly turned out , his brain was the solidarist male part of the hormone spectrum .
and when he was born , he looked like a boy -- no one said anything .
and only when he became 19 years old , he got enough medical problems , in fact , because he was mentioning that the doctors were in the inner female .
okay , just a quick example of a variation of intersexual importance .
some people with xx chromosomes , they develop something that &apos;s called ovory estis , where it &apos;s ovarian tissue .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this is happening .
so gender can occur in many different varieties .
the reason why children with this kind of body -- it was zwarf or siamesan twins , whether it &apos;s interesting -- of surgeons often adapted to the norm , not because it would be for their physical health of advantage .
in many cases , these people are perfectly healthy .
the reason why they &apos;re often doing different types of intervention is because they are threatening our social categories .
in general , our system is based on the idea that a certain anatomality is happening with a particular identity .
so we have the concept that being a woman is to have a female identity ; a black person is meant to have an african anatomy in terms of its own story .
so we have this awful simpler idea .
and if we are confronted with a body that is actually something very different for us , that confused us in terms of this representation .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas about individualism .
and our nation is really based on a very romantic concept of individualism .
now you can imagine how amazing it is when kids are born , the two people in a body .
where i had seen most of the excitement in the last time was the south african homenya semenya last year , whose gender in the suffering is asked in berlin .
many journalists call me the question : &quot; what test are you going to do , who tells us if caster semenya female or male is ? &quot;
and i had to explain the journalist that there is no test .
we now know that gender is complicated enough that we have to admit that nature doesn &apos;t take a line for us between male and female , or sexually sexually sexually sexually sexually sexually sexually sexually sexually sexually sexually sexually sexually sexually sexually sexually sexually sexually sexually sexually sexually endangered .
so we have a situation where , the further our science advances , we have to come up with so much more , that these categories that we &apos;ve held for robust anatomic categories , which was very simple to create , is a lot of inadverdities to create permanent identical .
and it &apos;s not just related to gender .
it &apos;s also true of race , which turns out to be a lot more complicated than our terminology has approved .
in our way , we &apos;ve gotten out in all sorts of unwarms .
for example , we &apos;re entering the fact that at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees have with chimpanzees .
what are we going to do with the fact that we are only different from a few nuclear bases ?
as we continue to move our science further , we get increasingly into a zone of uncomfortable , where we need to recognize that the recycling categories we have probably are too simple .
we see this in all sorts of different areas of human life .
one of the areas in which we see this , in our culture , in our culture today , is the fighting over the beginning and the end of life .
we have difficult conversations about what a body becomes a human being , so he &apos;s got a different rather than fetal life .
we have very difficult conversations today -- perhaps not as public as in medicine -- about the question when somebody &apos;s dead .
our ancestors never had that hard to fight when somebody was dead .
you &apos;ve got a little bit more likely to get the nose out of the nose , and if you moved , you haven &apos;t been buried .
if you &apos;re not moving , you &apos;ve buried it .
but today we &apos;re in a situation where we &apos;re taking people &apos;s important organs and they want to feed them to other people .
and as a result , we start with the struggle with the really difficult question when someone is dead , and that brings us to a really difficult position in which we have no longer so simple categories .
now you might think that the whole thing was going to collapse from categories to someone like me .
i &apos;m a political progressive , defending people with unusual bodies , but i have to admit , it makes me nervous .
to understand that these categories are really much more unfair than we thought i was concerned .
and it makes me engage in terms of questioning democracy .
so to tell you about this tension , i first have to know that i &apos;m a big fan of the founding fathers .
i know they were angry , i know they were the best , but they were great .
i think that they were so tader and they were strong , and so radical , in which what they were doing was to look at all of the years that i was doing , and it &apos;s not because of the music that &apos;s absolutely forgotten .
it &apos;s because of what happened 1776 with the founding fathers .
the green fathers were out of my view of the original anatomic activists , which is why .
what she was back to was an anatomic concept , and they made it through another , which was radical and beautiful , and 200 years for us .
as you all remember , our founding fathers the concept of monarchy , and the monarchy in a very simplified concept of anatomy .
the glorious world had no concept based on dna , but they had a concept of birth on the right .
they had a concept of blue blood .
they were the notion that people who had political power should have this political power , because of the inherited blood line from the grandfather to the son and so on .
the greening fathers came back this idea , and they put it through a new anatomical concept , and this concept said that all humans were created .
they were mengging the field , and they decided that anatomically , the common common ties , not the differences , and that was very radical .
now they made this part because they were part of an educational system where two things grew up in common .
democracy grew up , but the same time also grew the science .
if you look at the history of the founding fathers , it becomes clear that many of you were very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a natural world .
they went away from explanations of natural species , and meathings like a supernatural concept of power , back where the transmission is based on a very vasty conceptual of birth .
they moved to a natural concept .
and if you look at the independence of independence , you talk about nature and the god of nature .
they &apos;re not talking about god and nature .
they talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
and as part of it , they managed to give us a concept of anatomical similarities .
and so they &apos;ve really prepared the future of civic rights movement .
they didn &apos;t think about it , but what they &apos;ve done for us was great .
so what happened then ?
for example , women who were looking at the election right now , the concept of the green fathers , is that anatomical is more important than the anatomical difference , and said , &quot; that we should have a uteran and the iron , &quot; that we should not have the choice right now , that we should not have the choice right , that we should not have the right to the public .
and women argued that .
next of all , the successful civil rights movement , where we saw people like sovory estrogen , who are doing it , &quot; am i not a woman ? &quot;
we find men in the camps &apos; lines , who say , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , people different colors that spread on anatomical similarities , again , successful .
we see the same thing about the disabled legal movement .
of course , the problem is that , as we start to look at all the similarities , we need to start asking in question why we keep ourselves separate .
well , realizing , i would like to keep certain separations , anatomically , in our culture .
for example , i don &apos;t want to give you the same thing as a man .
i don &apos;t want to say that we should take away from anatomy .
i don &apos;t want to say that 5-year-old should have the right to get your mind to sex or to marry .
so there are some anatomical separations that make sense to me , and that &apos;s what i think should keep .
but the challenge is to try to figure out what it is and why we keep them , and whether they &apos;re useful .
so let &apos;s go back to those two creatures that have been launched at the beginning of the talk .
we have two creatures , both in 1979 at the same day .
so let &apos;s imagine that one of them , maria , three months old , was born , so she was born in june 1980 .
heinrich , on the other hand , being born , he was born on a march of 1980 .
just because of the fact that maria 3 months had been born after , they all get different amounts of time in front of the heinrich -- having the right sex sex that &apos;s right to do .
heinrich needs to wait for all of this , not because he actually has another biological age , just because of the time of his birth .
we find other strange users about what their rights is .
heinrich , because you think that he &apos;s a male -- although i didn &apos;t tell you that he &apos;s with the representatives -- because you think he &apos;s a male , he can now be moved to what maria doesn &apos;t worry about .
but maria , not in all states , can &apos;t perceive the same right , the heinrich in all states , which is the right to marry .
heinrich can marry a woman in every state , but maria can only marry a woman in a few states today .
so we have these permanent anatomic categories that are problematic in many ways and fragmented .
and for me , the question is : what are we going to do , because our science makes progress in the field of anatomy , that we have to get a point where we have to admit that a democracy is based on anatomy , apart ?
i don &apos;t want to give up science , but at the same time it feels like science is constantly making itself .
so where do we go ?
it seems like our culture would take a kind of pragmatic posture : &quot; well , we have to move somewhere , so we move it somewhere . &quot;
but a lot of people start in a very strange position .
so for example , texas , in a point , decided that , to marry a man , that you don &apos;t have y chromosome , and a woman means to marry that you have a y chromosome .
now in practice , people are not testing on their chromosomes .
but it &apos;s also very bizarre , because of the story that i told you about the androgen defect .
if we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us in his &quot; i have a dream .
he says we shouldn &apos;t be asking people to &quot; their skin , but after their character , &quot; judge , and go beyond anatomy .
and i want to say , &quot; yes , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
but how do you do that in practice ?
how do you embrace people because of their character properties ?
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we should be given right to people like that , because i have to admit that i have a series of golden storms that probably make social benefits more than some people i know .
i &apos;d like to say that i probably know some of the bright labs that are stronger , more optimistic , more intelligent and stemature decisions about their sexual relationships than some 40 year-old i know .
so how are we going to ask the question of nature &apos;s properties ?
it turns out it &apos;s really difficult .
and part of me asks ourselves , what if the content of a personality would be something that would be in the future of machine readable -- could be made by an fmri ?
do we really want to go to that direction ?
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
what i know is that it really seems to be important to think about the idea that the united states is going to be concerned about the question of democracy .
in our commitment to democracy , we &apos;ve done our thing properly well , and i think we would do our thing well in the future .
we don &apos;t have the situation , for example , in iran , where a man , who feels sexually different from the other men , is going to be punished because he &apos;s ready to be able to be able to make a charity in which he &apos;s alive .
conditions that exist in us don &apos;t exist .
i &apos;m happy to say that we don &apos;t have these states -- a surgeon that i spoke to a couple of years ago , who had a few siamesan twins to separate them , partly to make a name .
but when i was talking to him , and he asked him why he made this intervention -- it was high risky surgery -- his answer was that in his country , these kids would be treated very badly , and so he had to do it .
and i said to him , &quot; well , did you have a political asylum to consider rather than a surgery to separate them ? &quot;
the united states will provide incredible opportunities to allow people to be the ones they are , without changing around the state .
that &apos;s why i think we need to hire .
well , just to finish , i want to tell you i &apos;ve talked a lot about the fathers .
and i want to think about the ways that democracy might look , or may have looked at the mothers if we had more involved .
and i want to say something that is radical for a feminist , and i think that there might be different kinds of insights that are being recognized by different kinds of anatomy , in particular , when people start thinking a group .
since years , because i was interested in intersexual matter , i &apos;ve also been interested in research in the field of gender .
and one of the things that i found really interesting is the difference between men and women in terms of how they think and operate in the world .
what we learned from cultural studies is that women , on average -- not every but on average -- tend to be more complex social relationships and the care of people who are within the group of vulnerable , very much attention .
and so , when we think about it , we have an interesting situation .
years ago , when i went to graduate school , one of my graduate students asked me , who knew my interest in feminine ism -- i looked at myself as a feminist , doing it .
he said , &quot; tell me what the feminism is female . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s the most grim question i &apos;ve ever heard .
in feminism , it &apos;s about paying attention to gender , so feminism isn &apos;t a female .
but the more i thought about his question to think more was that there could be something female in feminism .
it &apos;s meant to be able to give it something , on average , what female brains are doing with male social relationships , and pay attention to the protective needs .
so where the founding fathers were extremely compelling to figure out how individuals could be protected before the state , it &apos;s possible that if we put more mothers in this concept , we can actually make a concept , not just how to protect it , but how we care about each other .
and maybe it &apos;s where we need to go to the future when we take democracy on anatomy -- less about the individual body to think about identity , and think more about relationships .
so , as people try to create a perfect connection , we think about what we can do for each other .
thank you .
i &apos;m jessi and this is my suitcase .
but before i show you what i have in it , i will make a very public confession , and this is : i &apos;m obsessed with outfits .
i love the opportunity for everybody to find a different colorful , crazy outfit , to be able to take and photograph and photograph .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
i get all my clothes from the second hand on floy markets , and in the dry hand .
ooh , thank you .
prey shopping shopping allows me to reduce the impact of my garderobe to the environment , and also on my cash stock .
i meet all kinds of great people , my dollars for usually a good purpose ; i look pretty unique ; and it makes it shopping to my very personal search .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
will it have my height ?
will i like the color ?
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
if all the answers are yes , i feel like i won .
i come back to my suitcase , and i &apos;ll tell you what i got here at ted last week .
i mean , what does anybody with so many outfits ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought together .
i brought seven subpants , and that &apos;s all .
for exactly one week , everything i &apos;ve done in my suitcase .
i &apos;ve come up with everything i might have to wear , if i first came to palm springs .
and since they &apos;re not heard of me as the woman sitting around at ted in their underwear -- that means i found a few things .
and i really want to show you my outfits this week .
does it sound good ?
while i do that , i &apos;m also going to give you some of the lessons that i believe , whether or not , learned from these adventurals , not to wear anything new .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
i call this the beam tigers .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look great .
you can almost look great for less than 50 dollars .
this whole outfit , including the jacket has 55 , and it was the most expensive piece that i carried in this whole week .
monday : color is a powerful thing .
it &apos;s almost impossible to be impossible when you wear light red pants .
if you &apos;re happy , you get other happy people .
tuesday : adapting it absolutely .
i &apos;ve spent a lot of time trying to try and be trying to be myself , and at the same time adapt .
just be who you are .
if you surrounded yourself with the right people , you &apos;re not just going to understand it .
wednesday : hug your inner child .
sometimes people say to me , i like , as if i &apos;ll dress the games or that i remember her seven-year-olds .
i like to smile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
thursday : self-confidence is key .
if you think you &apos;re looking at something good , it &apos;s almost like this .
and if you think you &apos;re not going to look good in something , you &apos;re probably right .
i grew up with a mother who taught me the day .
but only when i became 30 , i really understood what that means .
and i &apos;m going to summarize that for you .
if you believe they &apos;re inside and outside a wonderful person , there &apos;s nothing you can &apos;t wear .
so there &apos;s no excuse for someone in this audience .
we should be able to focus everything we want .
thank you .
friday : a universal truth -- five words : golden pailletes .
and finally , saturday : one of your unique , unique , personal style is a great way to tell you about without having to say a word .
it was always proven to show me and again when this week came to people , just because of what i was wearing , and i had great conversations .
obviously that won &apos;t be all in my tiny suitcase .
so before i go home to brooklyn , i &apos;m going to donate it all again .
because the lesson i &apos;m trying to learn this week is that it &apos;s okay to let go .
i don &apos;t have to make these things emotionally , because right around the corner , it will always be a different kind of crazy , colorful , mental outfit , just waiting for me if i love a little in the heart , and it &apos;s looking .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good afternoon , all together .
i have something that i want to show you .
think of this as a site , as flying point .
this is what we call in our lab , perceptual design .
let me tell you a little bit about this .
now , if you take this picture -- i &apos;m originally italian , and every boy in italy grows with this picture in the room , but the reason i show you this is a very interesting thing in the past decades .
a while ago , it was that if you wanted to win a formula , then you took your budget and put your money on a good driver and a good car .
and if the car and the driver were good enough , they won the race .
now , if you want to win , if you want to win a race , actually something like this -- something that &apos;s going to reveal the car in real time , some thousands of sensors that can pass information out of the car , and then apply it to the car , and then apply it to the car , and then apply it to the car .
this would call you , in engineering teams , a real-time control system .
and basically , it &apos;s a system that is made out of two parts -- a tangible part and an argument .
what &apos;s interesting today is that the real-time control systems begin to emerge in our lives .
our cities have been equipped in the last few years , just with networks and electronics .
they become computer in the free .
and as a computer in the free , they start to respond to other kinds and different ways , and they &apos;re driven .
when we make cities , it &apos;s actually a big deal .
i just want to mention that cities are only two percent of the earth &apos;s land , but 50 percent of the world &apos;s population there .
they &apos;re 75 percent of the energy consumption -- to 80 percent of co2 emissions .
so if we do something with the cities , it &apos;s a big thing .
beyond the cities , all of this sense , and push into objects of everyday life .
this is from an exhibition , the paola antonelli for moma later in the year , during the summer .
it &apos;s called me . &quot;
now , all of our objects , our environment , start to talk to us .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost like any atom out there to both be a sensor and a sensor .
and that changes radically the interaction we humans have with our environment .
in a way , it &apos;s almost like the old dream of michelangelo ...
you know , as michelangelo , he shaped the moses , does it mean he took the hammer at the end and put him on moses -- actually , they can still see a little spot , and said , &quot; perché hidden parli ? why don &apos;t you talk ? &quot;
well , today , our environment begins for the very first time , to answer .
i &apos;m just going to show you some examples -- again , with the idea of taking our environment and push it .
let &apos;s start with the sense .
now the first project i want to show you is actually one of the first of our lab .
it came in italy four thousand years ago .
and what we &apos;ve done was actually to use a new kind of network of network that was used throughout the world -- this is a mobile phone web -- and anonymous and arranged information from this network to be able to understand how the city works .
the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
it was when italy won the world &apos;s foot championship .
some of you will remember , it was as an italy in italy , and then finally finish , the head driver .
and no matter italy at the end .
now you &apos;re looking at what happened this day , just watching the activity that happens in the network .
here you see the city .
you can see in the middle of the rustum , the fluvers .
on the morning , before the game .
you see the timeline .
early afternoon , people here and there , the calls and they move .
the game starts -- silence .
france does a gateway . italy does a gateway .
half time , people make a short call , go to the bathroom .
second half . end of the normal game time .
first extension , second .
quote , in a moment of the head crash .
italy wins . yeah .
now , in this night , everybody went to the center to celebrate .
they saw the big footprint .
the next day , everybody went to the center of the siegerteam and the prime minister at the same time .
and then everybody went down .
you see the image of the place circo massimo where , since the roman time , people go to celebrate -- to have a big party , and you see the bottom of the day .
now , this is just an example of how we can feel the city today , in a way that we couldn &apos;t do a few years ago .
another quick example of feeling : this is not about people , but about things we use and consume .
now , today we know everything about where our things come from .
this is a map that shows you all the chips that a mac computer is , as they came together .
but we just know a little bit about where things go .
so in this project , we actually designed some small markers to track the waste as he goes through the system .
so we started with some volunteers that we &apos;ve been doing , something more than a year ago , in seattle , to mark things that they would throw away -- different kinds of things you can see .
then we have the little chips , the small brands , on the trash , and started tracking it .
here are the results we have right now .
from seattle ...
after a week .
with this information we realized that there &apos;s a lot of inefficiency in the system .
we can do the same things in fact with less energy .
the data was not available before .
but that &apos;s a lot of inuseful transport , and more complicated things .
but the other thing is that we believe that if we see every day , the cup that we throw away doesn &apos;t just go away , that it &apos;s still somewhere on the planet .
and the plastic bottle that we still throw every day still remain there .
and if we were to show the people , we can make a behavioral change .
so that &apos;s the reason for this project .
my colleague at mit , assaf biderman , could tell you a lot more about the understanding and the many other wonderful things that you can do with understanding , but i want to get to talk to you about the second part of the environment that we discussed at the beginning and this is the influence of our environment .
and the first project is something that we did a few years ago in zaragoza , spain .
it started with a question of the civil census that came to us and said that spain and south europe has a beautiful tradition , in public places water as part of the architecture .
and the question was , how could you connect technology to new technology ?
and one of the ideas that had been applied to a working group was , imagine these flells , and valves , magnetic valves , working and close .
it &apos;s the kind of water that comes out of the water of the water .
if these dots fall down , they can write , they can write patterns , images , text ads .
and you can approach him , and he &apos;s going to open up to let you jump through how you can see on this picture .
well , we introduced the mayor hole .
it really liked it .
and we got the assignment to design a building in the back of the expo .
we called it the digital water pavillion .
the whole building was water .
there &apos;s no doors or windows , but if you approach it , it will open and let it go .
the roof was also covered with water .
and if it &apos;s windy , if you want to reduce the syringes , you can even let the roof down .
or you could close the building , and the whole architecture , as in this case , you know , this days , when you go down the roof , you get pictures of people who were there and say , &quot; you &apos;ve destroyed the building . &quot;
no , they don &apos;t have destroyed the building , it &apos;s just that architecture disappears almost .
here &apos;s how the building works .
you see the person wondering what happens inside .
and here you see me looking at the testing of the sensors that opened the water , not getting wet .
now , i should tell you what happened at night when all the sensors stopped working .
but in fact , it was a even greater fun night .
all the children from zaragoza came to the building , because the way they played with the building was very different .
no longer a building that would open up to let them go , but a building that still had breaks and holes in the water , you had to jump now without getting wet .
and that was , for us , very exciting , because architects , engineers , as designers , think about how people use things that use things we use .
but reality is always unpredictable .
and that &apos;s the beauty of creating things that are used and interacting with the people .
so here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical visual imagery , the imagery points from water and projections .
and this is what made us think about this project that i &apos;m going to show you now .
imagine that these dots could actually start flying .
imagine if you could have small boots that fly through the air , and every one of you with a little show with intercreacting light -- almost like a cloud that can move through the space .
here &apos;s the video .
imagine a helicopter that you saw earlier , which is moving to other people , completely accurate .
you can have this cloud .
you can have a kind of flexible screen or display , like these -- a smooth formation in two dimensions .
or unregular , in three dimensions , where what changes , the light is not the position of imagery .
you can play with different kinds of games .
imagine the screen could just appear in different formats or sizes , in different ways .
but then it could only be one 3d cloud of images that you can go through and move through that you can look at in many , many directions .
here you see a real flyfire-social controller that goes down to shape how they used to form an equal v .
if you turn on the lights , it looks like this . so the same way we saw it before .
imagine that every single one of people is being operated .
it could have an impulse to have a impulse that comes from people , from the movements of people or anything .
i want to show you something first .
we worked with robert to bolle bolle , one of the best ballet dancers of our time -- the étoid at the metropolitan theater in new york and the scala in maan -- we took his movement in 3d to use it as a impulse for the flyfire .
here you see robert to dance .
on the left-hand side , you see the imagery points , the different procedures .
it &apos;s a real-time 3d scan , and a movement .
so you can understand the whole movement .
you can do that all the time .
but then , once we have all the imagery , you can play and play with color movement and use movement .
we want to use this as a possible impulse for the flyfire .
i want to show you the latest project that we &apos;re working on .
it &apos;s something that we &apos;re working on for the olympics in london .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
and the idea is , again , imagine that we put people together to do something and change the environment -- almost like that , how we call it , cloud movement , how to move a check , but with a cloud .
imagine if anybody can give a little donation for a point .
i think this is the remarkable for the last few years , the last couple of decades that we have changed from a physical world .
this has digitized everything , knowledge and making it available through the internet .
now , for the first time , we can do this for the first time -- and the campaign has shown this -- we can take the digital world , from the digital world to the physical world .
that can be in our case that we use it to design and create a symbol .
this is something that is built in the city .
but tomorrow , in order to confront the challenges , think about climate change , or the co2 emissions -- how can we go from the digital world to physical change ?
so the idea is that we actually bring people together , in which they do things together .
the cloud is again a cloud of images in the same way that a real cloud is a cloud from particles .
and these particles are water , as our cloud is a cloud of images .
it &apos;s a physical form in london , but with images .
they can move inside and make different kinds of experiences .
you can actually look at it from the bottom , the most important moments for olympic 2012 and darer , and it &apos;s as kind of the connection to community .
so both the physical cloud in the sky and something that you can go on at the top , like londons .
you can go inside .
and a kind of digital complachtower in the night -- but as the most important , a new kind of experience for everybody who wants to go to the top .
thank you .
as an artist , i &apos;m very important to the context .
through my work , i try to express that people are not separate from nature and that everything is connected to each other .
the first time i was in antarctica 10 years ago , where i saw my first ice mountains .
i wonder awe .
my heart rasts , i was heated , as i was trying to grab what was before me .
the ice mountains around me rasted 60 feet from the water , and i could just wonder that this was a snowflake on a different snow , a year after year .
ice mountains are born as calb of a glacier or by breaking out of ice cream .
every ice mountain has its own individual personality .
they interact in equal ways with their environment and their experiences .
some people would give up and brake up to the bitter end , while other people don &apos;t get more and more dramatic in one case .
if you look at a ice mountain , you think they &apos;re isolated , isolated and alone , as we humans often see .
but the truth is far away from it .
and as a ice mountain melts , i &apos;m going to go through his pre-time atmosphere .
during the ice mountain , he releases mineral water drinking water , which kills many forms of life .
i go to my recording of these ice mountains as if i was making portraits my ancestors , in consciousness that they exist in these individual moments of view , and never get existed again .
it &apos;s not a death , if you melt ; it &apos;s not a end , but a continued of your pathways along the life cycle .
part of the ice in the ice mountains that i &apos;m documenting is very young -- some thousand years old .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
the last pictures i &apos;d like to show you is an ice mountain that i put in clubs in clubs .
very rarely , you can actually witness a rolling ice berg .
here you see it now .
on the left , you see a little boat .
this is about five feet long .
please pay attention to the form of the iceberg and where he &apos;s in the water line .
you can see here , he starts to roll , and the boat has moved to the other side , the man is there .
this is the average size of a prinland iceberg .
it &apos;s about 120 feet from the water , or 40 feet .
and this video is real time .
and just like that , you show a different side of its personality .
thank you .
my life is truly blessed by work on some amazing projects .
but the coolest thing i ever worked on was this guy .
his name is temple .
temple was one of the leading graffiti artists of the 1980s .
then , one day , he came back from walking and said , &quot; paps , my legs . &quot;
and that was the outbreak of it .
temple is completely paralyzed today .
he can only use his eyes .
i stood against him .
i have a company that makes design and animation , so it &apos;s really a complex part of what we admire in the art world and watch .
so we decided , tony -- temple -- and to support his thing .
i met with his father and his brother and he said , &quot; we &apos;ll give you this money .
what are you going to do with it ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk back to tony .
i just want to talk to him , and i said , &quot; wait , is this not -- i saw stephen hawking -- can &apos;t all be the paralyzed people using this devices ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , only if you &apos;ve heard about higher social layer and have a remarkable insurance , you can really do that .
ordinary people are not available . &quot;
and i said , &quot; how are you communicating now ? &quot;
did anybody see the movie &quot; butterfly and adcherbell ? &quot;
so they communicate -- their fingers walk along .
i &apos;m like , &quot; very archaic , how can that be ? &quot;
so i came to the need , just to put a check , and instead , i put a check out of that i didn &apos;t have the best idea i had to solve .
i &apos;m committed to the place and his brother and his father -- with the words : &quot; well , my proposal is like this : tony &apos;s going to talk to him , we &apos;ll get a device , and we &apos;ll find a way to get his art back .
because it &apos;s a farce that somebody who &apos;s still in it , it cannot communicate . &quot;
so i spoke a few months later at a conference .
i met these people from grl , graffiti research lab , and they have a technology that allows them to map a light on any surface , and then draw with a laser pointer that only recognizes the negative space .
so they &apos;re moving around and doing art installations like this .
they say all things that are shown up there are a life cycle .
it starts with the rising ones , then the vaccining words come out , and the bush pulls up , and they actually do art .
but there was always a life cycle in your presentation .
so i went home , and i had dinner with my wife and told her , and we thought , &quot; well , second time , if there &apos;s this technology , you can use it to drive things to control things , then we should find a way to control things , and then we should find a way to control things . &quot;
that was the beginning of the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , a lot of organization and a lot of things , we have achieved some things .
first , we have the insurance coming down the doors , and actually received a device that he can communicate with -- a stephen hawkter machine .
that was incredible .
and he &apos;s really extremely funny -- i call him yoda , because you talk to him , or get an email , and thinks , &quot; i &apos;m so imworthy of this guy . &quot;
we &apos;ve also entered seven programmers from all around the world -- literally from all the corner of the world -- to us .
my wife , my children and i moved into the garage , and these hackers and programmers and conspiracy and conspiracy have taken our home .
many of our friends thought that we were pretty stupid to do that and that we came back and all the images on the walls would be graffiti .
but for over two weeks , we have programmed , we went to the beach promenade in venice , my children became involved , and we created this .
it &apos;s called eyewriter and you can see the description .
this is a cheap sunglasses that we bought at the beach promenade of venice , something copper wire and a few things from the construction market and the electric management engine .
we took a representative camera , they put them apart , they put on a led light , and we now have a device that is available -- you can build it yourself , we make the code free to free .
so we have created a device that is completely free of constraints .
no insurance can do it .
no hospital .
every paralyzed now can actually communicate with its eyes alone or draw .
thank you .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to the temple room .
i love this picture , because it &apos;s somebody else &apos;s room and that &apos;s his room .
now , there &apos;s all of this bee in front of the big unveiling .
and after a year of planning , two weeks of programming work , nuodparties , and finished , tony drew for the first time after seven years .
and this is a remarkable picture , because this is his life support system , and it looks beyond his life support system .
we &apos;ve identified his bed so he can look outside .
we set a projector based on a wall of space in front of the hospital .
and he drew again for the first time in both his family and friends -- and you can just imagine what a feeling that was on the parking lot .
we also had to break in the parking lot of parking , so we felt like a part of the spray scene .
at the end of sand, he gave us an email with the content , &quot; for the first time , i &apos;ve drawn something .
i feel that i was fooled by water , and finally , someone moved down and pulled my head up so i can breathe . &quot;
isn &apos;t that overwhelming ?
this is something like our calendar scream .
that &apos;s keeping us on the shelf and continues to evolve .
and we need to make a lot better at this device .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s a magic board .
and somebody who has such an artist potential makes so much more .
so we &apos;re going to figure out how to make it better , faster and stronger .
since that time , we have all kinds of recognition .
we won a few prizes .
remember , it &apos;s free , nobody deserves it .
it all comes from our own pockets .
so the ones were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
armstrong # stood on us and then , in december of december , the time magazine was honored by one of the 50 best inventions in 2010 , which was really great .
the coolest thing is -- and that includes the entire circle -- that this april , in the curved moca in the downtown of los angeles , will give an exhibition &quot; way of the streets . &quot;
and there are probably going to be pretty much the toughest representatives of the street art scene -- banking , shepard &apos;s crucial , caws -- all these guys will be there .
temple is going to be part of what &apos;s going on .
so basically , if you see something that &apos;s impossible , it &apos;s possible .
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this microphone , the eyewriter -- everything was impossible .
make it possible -- you all here .
i &apos;m not a programmer , and i &apos;ve never had anything to do with augenero technology , but i just got a little bit suspicious and surrounded with amazing people so we could put something on the legs .
and this question should be all of you , and every single day you get something that has to be done . if not now , when ? and if not me , who ?
thank you .
so , i write for kids , and i &apos;m probably america &apos;s most common child bookauthor .
and i &apos;m always saying that i don &apos;t want to come like a scientist , therefore .
you can have me as a farmer , or in leather , but nobody has ever elected farmers .
today i want to tell you about circles and disagreements .
well , a epiphany is usually something for you to find because you &apos;ve lost it somewhere .
you go to the block and you take it as a revelation .
this is a painting of a circle .
one of my friends did it -- richard wolingchr.
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle i &apos;d like to tell you today .
my circle then started in the &apos; 60s at high school at high school , ohio , where i was the classroom .
i was the one who was beaten every week in the virgoms of green and blue , until a teacher saved my life .
she saved my life by using the toilet in the teacher .
they did it .
she did three years .
and i had to go out of the city .
i had a thumb , i had 85 dollars , and it proposed to san francisco in california -- i found a lover -- and then i found it in the &apos; 80s , and i found it a work in aids organizations .
about three or four years ago , i received a call from this teacher by this teacher , woman post , &quot; i have to see them .
i &apos;m a sad thing to never know each other as adults .
you can come to ohio , please come to ohio , and please come together with the guy that i know you &apos;ve found now .
and i should say that i &apos;m going to be building the builp of scratch , and that i want you to go . &quot;
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
we looked at them , we laughed , we laughed , and we knew they must be in a hospice .
we found one for them , we took them , and we sat around , and we gave them eight , because it was necessary .
it was something we knew to do .
and just as the woman who really wanted to know me as adults , they turned out to be in a box , and put it in my hands .
what happened was that the circle was closed , it had become a circle -- and the revelation of that i showed you .
the revelation is , death is a part of life .
she saved my life , and my partner and i rescued her .
and you know , this part of life needs everything that needs the rest of life .
he needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so happy that this is so often mentioned here .
it needs the same -- he needs to have love , love and pleasure . and it &apos;s on us to give these things .
thank you .
imagine a big explosion , as you climb on 1,000 feet .
imagine a plane full of smoke .
imagine a motor piece , the blade , smiley bag , creack , creack , creack , creack .
that sounds scary .
well , i had a unique place on this day ; i sat on 1d .
i was the only one who was able to talk to the airport .
so i looked at it , and they said , &quot; no problem , we &apos;ve probably caught some birds . &quot;
the pilot had already signed the machine , and we weren &apos;t far away .
you could see manhattan .
two minutes later , three things happened simultaneously .
the pilot set up the machine after the hudson river .
it &apos;s usually not the route .
he turns the engines off .
imagine a sound plane .
and then he said three words -- the smartest words that i &apos;ve ever heard .
he says , &quot; take it to the elevator . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the local staff .
i could see it in your eyes , because it was cruel to finish life .
i want to share with you three things that i learned about this day .
i learned that in a moment , everything else is different .
we have this life plan , we have these things that we want to do in life , and i thought about all the people i wanted a hand , and it wasn &apos;t done , all the fences i wanted to do , and never did .
while i was thinking about it later , a saying that , &quot; i collect bad wa . &quot;
because if the wine is as far and the person is there , i open it up .
i never want to move into life .
and that urgency , this goal , really changed my life .
the second thing i learned about this day -- and that was when we failed the george washington bridge , so that i thought , &quot; man , there &apos;s one thing i really regret . &quot;
i had a good life .
in my own humanity , and with my mistakes , i decided to become better in everything i grabbed .
but in my humanity , i gave myself my ego .
and i took the time that i wasted for meaningful things , with people who mean something .
and i thought about the relationship with my wife , to people .
and after i thought about it , i decided to put negative energy from my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
i haven &apos;t posted two years anymore with my wife .
it feels great .
i &apos;m not trying to have it right ; i &apos;m going to decide to be happy .
the third thing i learned -- while the inner clock is beginning , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 , ... &quot;
you see the water coming .
i said , &quot; please go to the air . &quot;
i don &apos;t want this thing to break up in 20 parts of how you know it from a documentary .
while we fall down , i had this feeling , human being , to die is not scary .
so , almost as if we prepare our lives on it .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and that sadness really turned into an thought , which is that i &apos;m just one thing .
i just wish i could see my kids grow up .
about a month after that , i visited a performance of my daughter -- first graders , not much artist talent .
... not yet .
and i celebrated , i like a little kid .
and in the world , everything was a sense of me .
i realized at the time , by connecting the dots to be a great father .
more than anything , everything else is my only goal to be a good father .
i became the miracle part of that day not to die .
i got another gift , which is to see in the future , and come back and live and live differently .
my call to everybody who flies today is : do you imagine the same thing happens on your flight -- don &apos;t -- but do you imagine , and how would you change ?
what would you do , you know , because they think they were always there ?
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in it ?
and more than anything else , are they the best parents you can possibly be ?
thank you .
the idea behind the pexnet computer worm is pretty simple .
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bomb .
the most important post for the development of nuclear weapons is the ancient incentives facility in natasha .
the gray boxes that you see here are real-time control systems .
now , if we can do that , the systems , the systems and the valves control , then we can actually cause a lot of problems with the centrifuge .
these gray boxes don &apos;t run with winters software ; it &apos;s based on a completely different technology .
but if we can make it that an effective windmill virus is used on a laptop that &apos;s used by a warde engineer to conprove these gray box , we &apos;re in business .
and that &apos;s the planning behind student .
so we start with a windmill drone .
the use of the data is transstructed into the gray box , damaged the centrifuge and the iranian nuclear energy program -- mission accomplished .
this is a child game , right ?
i want to tell you how we found that .
when we started our research , six months ago , it was completely unknown , which was the meaning and purpose of this engineering .
the only thing we knew is very , very complicated what the windmill -- part of the drone -- made part of it , made it from a flower -- daydigit use .
and it seemed to have something , with these gray boxes , that real-time control systems .
so this resonated our attention and we started a lab project where we infected our environment with stuxnet , and we studied this constructed .
and then something funny happened .
stuxnet complained like a laboratory rat who didn &apos;t like our cheese -- snick it , but didn &apos;t want to eat it .
that didn &apos;t make sense in my eyes .
and after having experimented with different kinds of cheese , i went to realize that this was a target attack .
all of a specific goal .
the drone strike on the gray box , when a special configuration was discovered . even if the special program , which tries to infect it on this target .
and if not , phxnet does nothing .
so , the bucking really interest , and we started working , almost around the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
it might say , for example , an american power power , or a chemical plant in germany .
so we should soon find out what the goal is .
so extrafied and decompatible , we found the attack -- and found that in two digital warheads -- a smaller and a bigger .
and we also realized that they were very professionally designed by people who were obvious to all of them .
they knew all bits and bytes that they had to attack .
they probably knew the size size of the machine interface .
so they knew everything .
and if you &apos;ve got , you know , the drone of stuxnet complex and high-tech , let me tell you , the data is a science for itself .
it &apos;s much more sophisticated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
here you see a clip from this attack -- code .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 lines code .
looks pretty much like old-fashioned logging language .
and i want to tell you how we were able to be smart in this code .
so , first of all , we were looking at systems function , because we know what this makes .
and then we were looking for tibers and data structures , trying to bring this with the real world -- potential goals in the real world .
so we needed theories about these goals that we could demonstrate or disprove .
so in order to make these theories , let &apos;s remind ourselves that it &apos;s definitely about high-speed sabotage , it has to act a high quality , and it &apos;s very likely to be in iran because most infections have been reported there .
now , in this area , there &apos;s not several thousand targets .
it &apos;s essentially going out to the bucheck nuclear power plant and the urces in natasha .
so i said to my assistant , &quot; bring me a list of all the experts for centered and power plants from our client . &quot;
and i called them up , and zapched her knowledge to compare her knowledge with what we found in the code and in the data .
and that worked very well .
so , it was possible for us to bring the little digital warhead with the rotorle controller .
the rotor is this moving part in the centrifuge , these black objects that you see .
and when you translate the speed of this robine , you &apos;re actually able to crack the rotor and finally , to let the centrifuge explode .
what we &apos;ve also found is that the goal of the attack was actually going to make it happen , and let &apos;s make it easy -- obviously in the attempt to do engineers so that they wouldn &apos;t be able to get quickly behind it .
the great digital explohead -- we got a glimpse by looking at very precisely data and data structure .
so for example , the number 164 stigs out of this code ; you can &apos;t overmiss it .
i started working with scientific literature , which is how this centrifugene was built in natasha , and found that they &apos;re structured in the cascads , and every kaskade contains 164 centrifugen .
so that made sense , put it together .
and it was better .
this centrifugen in iran is broken up in 15 called planes .
and guess what we found in the attack code ?
almost identical structure .
so again , that really drew together .
and this gave us great confidence for that we studied here .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , not just that .
these results were achieved by several weeks hard work .
and often we just ran into a dead end and we had to re-gather .
anyway , we found out that both digital warheads in reality were on one and the same target , but from different directions .
the little explohead takes a caskade , and overturn the rotors and slowed them down , and the big warhead goes with six caskads in interaction and manipulated .
so , in the great and all of us , we &apos;re really confident that what the goal is .
it &apos;s natasha &apos;s and it &apos;s just natasha .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that others could be hit by stuxnet .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we &apos;ve discovered -- really made me out of the sows .
there &apos;s the gray box down there , and you see it on top of it .
now , what &apos;s causing this thing is that it &apos;s beginning to catch up sensors -- so for example , sensors and vibrational sensors , and it turns out to be legitimate code that goes through the attack , with false data .
and in fact , this is the false data data of stuxnet before .
so it &apos;s just like in hollywood movies , where during the chase hunt , it &apos;s been fed by the surveillance of the surveillance video .
that &apos;s cool , isn &apos;t it ?
the idea here is obviously not just the machine interface in the control room .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and more aggressive .
the idea is to overlist digital security system .
we need digital security systems where a human machine can &apos;t respond fast enough .
so , for example , in a power station , if the big steam turbine becomes too fast , you have to open in of milliseconds .
of course , this cannot be done by a human machine leader .
so this is where we need digital security systems .
and when they &apos;re at risk , they can really get really bad things .
the power station can explode .
and neither the machine leaders , the security system will notice it .
that &apos;s scary .
but it gets worse .
and what i &apos;m saying is very important .
think about it . this attack is generic .
he has nothing to do with centered , with uranium wealth .
so for example , he would work so well -- in a power plant or a car factory .
it &apos;s generic .
and you don &apos;t have to -- when the attacder -- you don &apos;t have to take the data on the use of an anbk , how we saw it at stuxnet .
you could also use ordinary worm technology to disseminate .
you just have to spread it as far as possible .
and if you do that , eventually you get an cyber weapon .
that &apos;s the consequence that we have to ask .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of goals is not in the middle east .
they &apos;re in the united states , in europe and japan .
so all of these green areas , these are the richest environments .
we need to have the consequences and we &apos;re getting better to prepare .
thank you .
i have a question .
ralph , it was reported a lot of them that people assume that the mosiness is the main organization behind it .
is that yours ?
okay , you really want to know ?
yeah . okay .
my opinion is the octopus , but the driving force is not israel .
so the driving force behind it is the cybersuperpower .
there &apos;s only one and those are the united states -- luckily , fortunately .
because otherwise our problem would be even bigger .
thank you for letting us look at a marriage . thank you ralph .
i &apos;ve spent the last couple of years sitting in situations that normally are very difficult and somehow dangerous .
i went to jail -- hard .
i worked in a coal sheet -- dangerous .
i filmed in war areas -- hard and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days , nothing like this to eat -- at the beginning , a little bit difficult in the middle , very dangerous at the end .
in fact , i &apos;ve been exposed to the biggest part of my career to the terrible situations , and it &apos;s all for the attempt to study social belang that they &apos;re concerned about , and hopefully , in a way , what makes it happen to the audience and how it makes it accessible .
so when i knew that i would come here to look at the world in a tedtalk of branding and sponges , i knew i would do something different .
some of you may have heard that i had a display in ebay a few weeks ago .
i sent a few facebook messages , some twitter news , and i gave people the opportunity to stand the right rights on my tedtalk 2011 .
and , really , some happy people and companies , tb profits and venture , got the unique opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris anderson is not going to go back to the point that i &apos;m going to show you , which is not going to be a title .
so what you got was this : your name here is : my tedtalk , which you don &apos;t know what the theme is going to be , and you could ever fly the ears after the ears , especially if i &apos;m your company for your involvement .
but besides , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
you know how many people are watching these tedtalks ?
a whole lot .
this is just the workforce .
so despite that warning , i knew anyone would buy the rights rights .
if you asked me this now , i wouldn &apos;t have been able to tell you this with certainty .
but in the new project i work on , my new film , we study the world of marketing , the advertising .
as i said , i &apos;ve been doing some pretty terrible situations over the years , but nothing could prepare me , nothing to me , on anything so difficult and so dangerous with these guys in a room .
you know , i had the idea of a movie .
what i want to do is a film about the operations , marketing and advertising , where the whole film is funded by coding , marketing and advertising .
and the film is called &quot; the zepdit ever &quot; ever called the &quot; the echo . &quot;
so what &apos;s happened in the &quot; the zepdit ever &quot; is that everything from above to bottom , from the beginning to the end to the end , is totally covered by brands that you &apos;ll see in the movie , that &apos;s the brand x.
now this brand , the lighter stadium stadium , the stading center ...
these people will be connected to the film in infinity forever -- forever .
and so the film will examine this whole idea -- this is what ? in infinity , forever ?
i &apos;m a redundant person .
that was more to concrete .
it was &quot; in infinity forever . &quot;
but we will not only have the brand x as a cover , but we &apos;ll make sure that we &apos;re going to sell every category in the movie .
we may be selling a shoe , and he &apos;s going to be the greatest shoe that they ever wore ...
the greatest car that you &apos;re ever willing to do , from &quot; the rockefeller &quot; ever ever , is the greatest drink of drinks that you &apos;ve ever had , a attention of &quot; the zepdit ever . &quot;
so the idea is , besides showing you that brands are part of life , actually , to bring it to the film ?
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
the goal of the whole film is transparency .
you &apos;ll see the whole thing in the movie .
so this is the whole concept , the whole film , from the beginning .
and i would love if ceg would help to do this .
you know , it &apos;s funny because when i first heard it , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience .
i don &apos;t know how people are going to be criticized .
do you have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use &quot; perspective , &quot; because that &apos;s a negative connotation -- but you know how it &apos;s going to evolve ?
how much money will it take to realize that ?
1.5 million .
i think it &apos;s going to be hard to meet you , but i think it &apos;s definitely worth spreading , some really familiar brands .
and who knows , when the film comes out , we might see a little bit of the horliots .
what do you think the answer will be ?
the answer is very likely to be &quot; no . &quot;
but is it a difficult thing about the movie or a difficult thing for me ?
jk : both .
so ... so , not so optimistic .
so , my lord , can you help me ? i need help .
i can help .
okay .
fantastic .
we need to think about what brands are .
yeah .
if you look at the people they have to do with it ...
there are some places that we can apply to .
put the camera out .
i thought , &quot; think of the camera , &quot; that we wanted to call a background .
it turns out it really meant , &quot; we want to do nothing with your movie . &quot;
and just so , all these companies disappeared , one after another .
no one wanted to do something about the movie .
i was amazed .
they didn &apos;t want to have anything to do with the project .
and i was confused because i thought the whole concept of advertising was , you know , the idea of advertising , your product as many people as possible to see it as many people as possible .
especially in the world today , at this intersection of new and old media , and the media landscape -- it &apos;s not the idea to be in this new kind of exciting assessment tool that makes the masses .
no , that was what i thought .
but look , the problem was that my idea had a fatal error , and that was the following .
actually no , it wasn &apos;t the mistake at all .
that would have been no problem at all .
that would have been okay .
but what this picture represents is a problem .
you see , if you &apos;re an transparency search on google search , this is one of the first images that seems .
i really like your way , sergey brin . now .
this was the problem : transparency -- free from deception and door , just to discover and look through ; immediately , character characterized by sight and access to information , in particular terms of terms of business -- the last line is the biggest problem .
you know , we &apos;re going to hear a lot about transparency right now .
our politicians say it , our president says , even our ceos say it .
but when it comes to the fact that it should be implemented , it changes anything .
but why ? well , transparency is scary -- like this kind of weird bear that still cuts .
it &apos;s unpredictable -- like this strange land street .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
what else is that risky ?
it &apos;s a whole plate cool .
this is very risky .
so when i started talking to companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to narrative a story .
we want you to write a story , but we just want you to narrative your story . &quot;
you see , when i was a kid , and my father found me lying -- and there he is , and he &apos;s looking at me with this view -- he said , &quot; my son , there are three versions of every story .
there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the real version . &quot;
so you see , with this film we wanted to tell the true version .
but only one company , a agency , was ready to help us -- and that &apos;s because i &apos;ve known john bond and richard kirshentree for years -- i realized that i had to do it alone , i had to do it , i had to do it .
so what you suddenly started to understand -- or what i started to understand -- was that if you start talking with these companies , the idea of how your brand understood , is a bigger problem .
i have friends who make the big , giant hollywood movies , and i have friends that little bombtr-movies like me do .
and my friends , the great , giant hollywood movies , says that the reason their films are so successful about the brand partners that they have .
and then my friends , who are doing the little stereo movies , &quot; well , how are we supposed to compete with these big , gigantic movies ? &quot;
and the movie is called &quot; the zepdit ever ever . &quot;
so how exactly are we going to see ban in the movie ?
whenever i go to the way , and whenever i open up the medical closet , you &apos;ll see ban deodorant .
and every time i interview somebody , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ?
are you ? you see a little nervous .
i want to help you calm .
so maybe you should just put a little bit of this on the interview . &quot;
and then we offer one of these great dust .
either &quot; flwells &quot; or &quot; paradise , &quot; you will have the choice .
we will be equipped both for men as well as women -- solid , rolling or stick , whatever .
that &apos;s the short line .
now , i can answer all of your questions and give you an exit plate .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
as you talked about the smaller movies , we are a challenging .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other brands .
so doing things like this -- you know , people remember ban -- that &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested .
what words would you describe ?
ban is amputation .
this is a great question .
over-genes technology .
technology is not the way you should describe something that someone is doing under the eighth .
we talk about bold , fresh .
i think , &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word that these category really do something positive , unlike fighting odor and moisture .
it keeps you fresh .
as we can keep them fresh -- better fresh , more fresh , more fresh .
these things have a more positive effect .
and this is a million people .
what about me ? what about the prints ?
i have to talk to the man on the street , which is like me normal consumers .
you should tell me something about my brand .
how would you describe your brand ?
hmmm , my brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i really like beautiful clothes .
&apos; 80s revival on skes , except the washing day .
well , what &apos;s the brand ?
unique .
i think the genre , the style i &apos;ve got is &quot; dark glamour . &quot;
i like many black colors , lots of gray sounds and stuff like that .
but i normally have a accessories , like sunglasses , or a jewelry and stuff like that .
if dan was a brand , he would probably be a classic mercedes-hospital .
man 2 : the brand i am is , i would say , concrete fly .
two : part of a hippie , part of yogi , partly brooklyn girl -- i don &apos;t know .
man 3 : i &apos;m the smuseum guy .
i sell them all across the country , in the world .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
this is my brand in my little distorted industry .
man 4 : my brand is fedex because i was more mature .
man 5 : inconsistent alcoholans .
is that ?
lawyer : i &apos;m a banana tag .
i &apos;m tom .
well , we can &apos;t all be the guitar brand , but i often look at the interface of the dark glamour and doger .
and what happened was that i needed an expert .
i needed somebody who could walk in my head , someone who really could help me understand what &apos;s called the brand character .
and so i found a company called olson zzman in pittsburgh .
they have companies like neagra , febreze , hallmark , to discover this brand personality .
if you could do it for the , you could also help me .
they brought their pictures , yes ?
i have this . the first picture is a picture of my family .
just tell me a little bit about how with your thoughts and feelings of yourself .
these are the people who make my world view .
tell me about this world .
md : this world ? i think your world is the world where you live -- like humans around you , the friends , the family , the way you live , the work and the way you live .
all these things come and start from a place , and for me , and start with my family in west virginia .
what &apos;s next that you want to talk about .
next . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
what is the idea of the thought and feelings of themselves ?
it &apos;s like i &apos;d like to be .
i like things that are different .
i like things that are weird . i like special things .
tell me about the &quot; why &quot; period -- what does it bring us ?
what is the machete ? what ceramics are they currently ?
why is it important to start new ? what represents the red ?
tell me a little bit about this part .
a little bit more about you , not you .
what other metals are they in ?
you don &apos;t have to be afraid . what kind of achteraster are you ?
hurdy-gurdy ! no , thank you !
thank you very much for patience .
yeah . all right .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what it &apos;s going to be .
there was a lot of crazy things going on there .
the first thing that i saw was this idea that their signature personality is two separate , but it &apos;s got the same pages -- the morgan is out lololing &apos;s brand .
it &apos;s very good .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction with it .
and i think some companies are just going to focus on a strength rather than both .
many companies tend to -- and that &apos;s the human nature -- to avoid things that they &apos;re not sure they &apos;re going to be afraid , and they &apos;re going to be afraid , and they &apos;re actually doing it for themselves in a positive , and they actually turn it into something positive .
what other brands do ?
the first one is a classic , apple .
and you can also see it here , target , wii , mini coopers and jetblue .
well , there was stamps , and eight folds , these things that come and go , but a hit , eight-odd brand is a pretty strong thing .
an eight-odd , shot brand . how is your brand ?
if somebody asked you to describe your brand identity , your brand personality , how would you be ?
you have a upper attrix ? are you something that &apos;s going to bring blood into the hole ?
or are they more like a bust ?
are you something that a little bit quiet , a little bit more quiet ?
up attributes are things that play the game , fresh as the fresh prince , time-standing , adventurous , poised and loving like gandalf and mystical .
or are they more like a bust ?
are you eight / 7 and monasn like .7 ?
are they established , traditionally , foster , protecing , compassionate , like oprah ?
are they reliable , stable , family , safe , loving , directors and way like the dalai lama or yoda ?
in the course of the movie , we had more than 500 companies who were up and down and down and the &quot; no , because they didn &apos;t want to be part of the project .
they wanted nothing to do with this movie because they didn &apos;t have control , no control over the finished product .
but there &apos;s going to be 17 branders who were willing to give up on these control , who wanted to do with someone who was doing business like that , and i would like to tell you how to do the stories that we don &apos;t usually have to tell -- stories that would usually never support them .
they managed to tell us the story of the neuromarketing , as we tell the story in this movie , that nowadays you &apos;re using mris to take the lustcenters of the brain to go and make movies and films .
we went to sao paulo where foreign advertising was banned .
in the entire city for five years , there &apos;s no turning field , no posters , no shells , nothing .
and we went in school camps where companies are moving their way into schools , in all america .
the incredible thing for me is that the projects i got from the most of the feedback , or where i had the greatest success , those are where i interact with things directly .
and that &apos;s what these brands did .
because they went around the country , they went around the agencies , and they said , &quot; maybe the agencies don &apos;t really have their interest in the sense .
i &apos;m going to negotiate directly with the artist .
i &apos;m going to work with him and do something completely different , something that people bring to think that our world is challenging .
and what was it for you ? what &apos;s successful ?
now , since the film festival with sundance film festival , we can look at this .
according to burrell , in january , and since -- and that &apos;s not even the whole thing -- there were 900 million hits of this film .
this is actually just a period of two one-and-a-half weeks .
this is just online -- no press , no tv .
the film hasn &apos;t been balanced .
it doesn &apos;t even exist online . no more targeted .
it hasn &apos;t gone out in other countries .
well , finally , the film has gained a very big momentum .
and that &apos;s not bad for a project where almost every commercial agency that we talked about , their clients recommended to let them go .
something that i firmly believe is that if you get your chance to get risks , you have risks in these risks .
i think if you stop people from it , you get it closer to failure .
i believe that if you train your employees to avoid risks , you get the whole company ready to get a profit .
i feel that we need to encourage people to take risks .
we need to encourage people to have no fear that they might be afraid of .
finally , we should embrace fear .
we should put the bear in the cage .
welcome the fear . welcome the risk .
one of the big buttons , we &apos;re welcome to the risk .
and finally , we should welcome transparency .
today , more than ever before , it brings us a little bit of honesty .
and they said , with honesty and transparency , my overall talk , &quot; you &apos;ve been told about transparency , &quot; you &apos;ve been presented by my good friends of emc , who paid $ 7100 to ebay .
big data is turned into the world for organizations around the world .
emc : &quot; you welcome transparency &quot;
thank you .
now , morgan , in the name of transparency : what &apos;s happening right now with the $ 7100 ?
this is a great question .
i have a check in my pocket , in the head of the ted organization , the saplons foundation -- a check at the altitude of $ 7100 , to fund my ted performance in the next year .
my name is amit .
18 months ago , i did something else at google , and i got to do something with museums and art . my chete , which is now , gave me green light .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of fun negotiations and stories that i can tell you , with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the show .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we did this .
i think my personal view is very simple with this slide and its access .
i grew up in india .
i became a great education part -- i didn &apos;t shave -- but i had no access to many museums and this artwork .
when i went and visit this museums , i started to learn a lot .
and while i was working for google , i tried to do this desire -- making art accessible -- to bring technology together .
we then trained a team , a great team , and we started with this .
i &apos;m going to start with the demonstration , and tell you some interesting things that happened since the beginning .
so you &apos;re just going to be able projections .
you can see in all these museums around here .
there &apos;s the uffel in , moma , the hermitage , the rijks , the van gogh .
i actually come in one of my favorite , the metropolitan museum of art in new york .
you get to two because of it -- very simple .
click , and wumms , you &apos;re in this museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where they are -- bombay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t make any difference .
you go around and you freeze .
you want to engage in the museum ?
open the map , and jump with a click .
they &apos;re in there , they want to end up .
only further . fun .
check them .
thank you , but the best one is coming .
so i &apos;m now in front of one of my favorite images , i &apos;m serious workers in the met .
i see this plusmark .
if the museum gave us the picture , they click on it .
now this is one of the images .
these are all metadata .
those of you who are really interested in art can click here -- but i &apos;m clicking it away now .
this is one of the images we &apos;ve collected with the so-called gimoreixong technology .
for example , this picture has about 10 billion page points , i think .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you get for 10 billion points ? &quot;
that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to show you .
you can zoom in very easily and zoom out .
you see something funny here .
i love this guy ; his expression is unaffordable .
but then they really want deep into it .
and so i started playing around , and i realized there was something going on there .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
i went close , and i slowly realized that these kids were actually cheating .
i studied a little bit , talking to some familiar in the met , and actually found out that it &apos;s a game called curail , where a goose was beaten at the fag of tuesday with a stick .
apparently it was quite popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
to really close , you can go to the cracks .
just to give you the overview , i mean , so you can see what you get .
here we were , and this is the painting .
the best thing is , in a second .
let &apos;s go fast to moma , again , in new york .
another favorite picture of me , star night .
in the prior example , it was about finding details .
but what if you want to see the pinlights ?
and what if you want to see van gogh has created this master &apos;s work ?
you zoom in . you can actually go inside .
i &apos;m going to zoom in into one of my favorite paintings , until i really am the cracks .
this is star night , probably never seen this before .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite feature .
there are many more , but i don &apos;t have time .
that &apos;s the really cool part , it &apos;s called the collections .
each of you , everybody -- if rich or poor , whether you have a great house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
you can go ahead and create your own museum online -- from all these images you can make your own collection .
simple , you go in -- and i &apos;ve created this , it &apos;s called the power of the buddhist -- you can zoom around .
this is what &apos;s called the national record .
and you can put it on a note , send out your friends , and you can start a conversation about what you feel when you look at these masterpieces .
i think finally , for me , the main thing is that all the wonderful things here don &apos;t come from google .
they don &apos;t even come from the museums .
i should not say that .
they come from artists .
and that was an experience in humility for me .
i mean , i hope we &apos;re just going to be doing this digital medium of art , and they represent it online .
the biggest question that i asked you about is , &quot; did you do that to replicate a museum &apos;s experience ? &quot;
the answer to this is no .
it should make the experience .
that &apos;s why . thank you .
thank you .
this is a picture of your brain . your brain can be divided in two camps .
this is the left half , which is the logical side and then the right half that is the intuitive side .
if we had a measure of each hemisphere to measure each hemisphere , we could visualize your brain .
for example , that would be someone who is totally logical .
this would be somebody who is completely intuitive .
now , where would you position your brain on this scale ?
some of us may have chosen for one of these extreme , but i think , for most people in the audience , it looks like this -- with a high apered , which is in both hemispheres .
it &apos;s not like they &apos;re both exclusive or something .
you can be logical and intuitively .
and so i see myself as one of the people in common with most experimental quantum physics , which requires a good percentage of logic to bring together the complex ideas .
but at the same time , we need a good amount of intuition to actually do experiments .
how do we develop this intuition ? well , we love to play with things .
so we go out and play with it and then look like it responds , and then we start to develop our intuition .
basically , they do the same thing .
so one of the intuitive things that you &apos;ve developed over the years is probably that a thing can be at the same time .
i mean , it can sound strange to think that one thing is at two different places , but they didn &apos;t born with this idea , they &apos;ve developed it .
i remember seeing a child playing on a surface threshold .
he was a little kid , and he wasn &apos;t very good at it , and he fell over .
but i bet that playing with the soil is a very valuable lesson , which is that the great things don &apos;t just leave you , and that you stay at a point .
and this is a great conceptual model of the world , so long they &apos;re not a particle physicist .
it would be a terrible model for particle physicists because they don &apos;t play with soil , but with these little strange particles .
and if you play with your particles , you &apos;re all kind of weird things -- like you &apos;re going straight through walls , or that you can be at two different places .
and so they all wrote these observations , and they called the theory of quantum mechanics .
this was the state of physics a few years ago ; you needed quantum mechanics to describe the little , tiny particles .
but you didn &apos;t need them to describe the great everyday objects around us .
it didn &apos;t like my intuition , and maybe it &apos;s because i don &apos;t often play with particles .
well , i sometimes play with them , but not very often .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
i mean , nobody has ever seen a particle .
but my logical side doesn &apos;t really love it .
because if all the things made out of particles and all these particles are going to follow the rules of quantum mechanics , then shouldn &apos;t they just follow the rules of quantum mechanics ?
i don &apos;t see why it shouldn &apos;t be that .
so i &apos;d better be able to feel better with the whole thing if we could sort of show that everyday objects also follow the rules of quantum mechanics .
so i made a couple of years ago to do that .
i created one .
this is the first object you can see in the quantum mechanical superposition .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and you can see that green dot there in the middle .
this is the piece of metal that i &apos;m going to talk about .
this is a picture of the object .
this is bigger than me . we look at the center right here .
and here &apos;s a really big close-up of this little piece metal .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little piece of metal it &apos;s shaped like a jumcer and it stands over the edge .
so i made this thing in a similar way that you make a computer chip .
i went to a clean space with new silicon slices , and racking for 100 hours of all the big devices .
for the last bit , i had to build my own machine -- to build this like swimming pool , and get the thing .
this thing has the ability to be in quantum mechanical superposition , but it takes a little help to do it .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you know how uncomfortable it is to be in a crowded elevator ?
i mean , if i &apos;m alone in the elevator , i do all kinds of weird things , but then other people add up and i listen to all these things , because i don &apos;t really want to fix them , because i don &apos;t want to get them wrong .
so quantum mechanics says that unmoving objects are just as feeling .
they &apos;re not just people who are not only people , but the light that seems to them , and the wind that seems to them and the wind of the space .
and so we knew that if we wanted to see that this piece of metal mimics quantum mechanical activity , we had to throw out the whole thing .
and that &apos;s what we did .
we turned out the lights , we put it in a vacuum , and we put the entire air out and cooling it up until almost now , in the elevator , and the piece of metal was free to behave like it was .
so we measured his movement .
we found that it really moved really strange .
rather than that , it &apos;s just there , vibrating it . the way it vibrazed was about this kind of thing -- like an expanding and interconnected bloom .
in that we gave him a little push , we could get it to vibrate at the same time and not vibrating -- something that &apos;s allowed in quantum mechanics .
so what i &apos;m telling you is what truly fantastic .
what does it mean for an object to vibrate and not vibrating ?
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
so the first case : all the trillions of atoms that are out of the piece of metal is silent and at the same time moving the same atoms and down .
it &apos;s just too precise points of time .
they are the rest of the time .
that means that every atom at the same time is two different places , which is that the whole piece of metal is about two different locations .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
really .
it was worth making me crazy for all this year in the clean room , because , check that out of the scale between a single atom and this piece of metal is about the same as the difference between the piece of metal and you .
so if a single atom can be at the same time at two different places , that piece of metal can be at two different places , why not too ?
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logical side says .
so , imagine you &apos;re at the same time at various places , how would that feel ?
how would your consciousness handle your body in the room ?
there &apos;s another aspect in history .
when we were warming it up , the light went and looked inside , we saw that the piece of metal was always in a piece .
and so , i had to develop this new intuition that it looks like all the objects in the elevator are actually just open-source objects that together in a small space .
you hear a lot about how quantum mechanics says everything is connected to everything .
well , it &apos;s not quite right .
there &apos;s more behind that , it goes deeper .
it &apos;s that these connections , their connections with all the things around them , literally define who they are , and that &apos;s the deep and strange of quantum mechanics .
thank you .
in 2007 , i decided that we should be more reconcepts like we think about economic development .
it should be our goal that when families want to think about where they live and work , they give them the opportunity to choose between at least one hand of different cities that are all in competition around new residents .
now we &apos;re far away from this goal .
there are billions of people in developing countries who don &apos;t even have one single city that they would welcome to .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they are so much more value than it is to build .
so we could be very simple with the world , maybe even hundreds of new cities .
this may seem absurd for you , if you &apos;ve never thought about new cities .
so , just trade the building of apartments to the cities .
imagine half of the people who want to live in homes did this ; the other half yet not .
you could try to expand the capacity of existing apartments already .
but you know what they were going to do , in these homes and their environment , the laws of law to avoid weakance and to push out of the ground .
so it turns out it &apos;s very hard to look at all these extensions .
but you could go to a completely new place , a completely new housing block , and the laws are going to support one of these structures and not prevent it .
so i suggested that governments create new surfaces that provide enough space for a city and gave them a name : charter cities .
later , i discovered that , around the same time , ja4 and octavio have thought about the challenge of reform in honduras .
they knew that every year about 75,000 hondurans left their country to go to the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to make sure that these people can stay in their country and do exactly the same thing in honduras .
in this place , ja4 to octavio said , &quot; what happens if we put an undefeated surface of our country -- what if we just want to measure them a message of american embassy -- a part of the eastern botist and the people who are going to work in the eastern world , and they &apos;re going to have to work on the ground , and they &apos;re going to be able to do everything in the eastern world . &quot;
in the summer of 2009 , honduras under a hardsized dismanration .
in the next plantic elections , pepe lobo in a rehab , whose program promised both innovation and grasses .
he asked octavio to become his elbow .
in the meantime , i was ready to do tedglobal .
through improvement , and through the study of consumers , i tried to reduce this complicated concept of the charter city on the key elements .
the first point is the importance of laws , laws that determine you &apos;re not supposed to be able to do existing housing .
we give new technologies big attention , but for progress , it requires technologies and laws , and it &apos;s usually laws that keep us back .
in the fall of 2010 , a friend of guatemala sent the link to the tedtalk .
again , he showed him ja4 .
the two responded to me .
and said , &quot; let &apos;s present the head of our country ! &quot;
so we met in december in december of a hotel in miami in miami .
i &apos;ve tried to make sure how valuable cities are , how much value they are than they cost .
and i used this graph to show how valuable rohland is in a place like new york . think that a space in some cases is worth thousands of dollars .
but it was a pretty abstract discussion , at one point when there was a pause , has said octavio said , &quot; paul , maybe we might look at the tedtalk . &quot;
so the tedtalk introduced in very simple form , that a charter city is a place that is uninhabited in the beginning of uninhabited land , a green contract , the laws that represent the laws that are there , and the people who have the opportunity to decide either , or not .
that &apos;s why i was asked by the president of hong duras , which meant that we need to make this project that it &apos;s important , and that this is the way our country is going to be .
i was asked to come to tegucigalpa , and again , at the fourth and fifth , a lecture .
so i gave another one with facts , which is a graphic like this , which is trying to make sure that if you want to make a lot of value in a city , it &apos;s a very big city .
this is a picture of the city , and the sketch is the new airport that was built in denver .
this airport alone has a hundred square miles .
so i &apos;ve tried to convince the hondurans , if you want to build a new city , start with a field of at least 1,000 square kilometers .
this is more than 250 acres .
polite , everybody appled .
the faces of the audience were very serious and careful .
the director of the congrence came to the stage and said , &quot; professor romer , i thank you very much for your talk , but maybe you might look at the tedtalk .
i &apos;ve got him on my laptop . &quot;
so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk .
and i &apos;ve come to the conclusion that a new city gives people new possibilities .
there would be the opportunity to live in a city that would be in honduras rather than hundreds of miles away from the north .
and a new city is also making new possibilities for leaders .
the leaders of the government in honduras would be committed to help countries , they could benefit from their partner , they can benefit from their partner to make the law for this charter and to support the cause that everybody can trust the charter .
and the realization of president lobo , was that the confidence that i &apos;ve been thinking about as a way to get the foreign investors to come and build this city could be in hong duras for all the parties that have been suffering for many years .
we &apos;re in a field .
this picture is from this place .
it &apos;s a thousand square kilometers .
and shortly after that , on january 19th , they voted with congress for a change of the constitution , to have a seductive fight for special development areas .
in a country that has just been a huge crisis behind itself , congress was elected to a voice of 324 to a voice .
all the parties , all of the places of society , supported this .
to become part of the constitution , it has to be twice by the congress .
on february 17th , it became the second time with 114 to a voice .
right after that election , between the 21st and the 24th , february , a delegation of about 30 dog deaths in the world that were most interested in the two places that were most interested in the city of the community .
one place is south korea .
this is a picture of a large , new city , which is built in southern korea -- big than the city of bostons .
everything you can see on this picture was built within four years , after it took four years to get permission .
the other place that was very interested in the city building is singapore .
there were two cities built in china , and the third is in preparation .
so if you think handy about it , it &apos;s where we are today .
they already have a construction site ; they already consider this area for the second city .
it &apos;s already been working on a legal system that literacy allows , and it &apos;s also been working on an external legal system .
a country already has already offered its top court to provide as a dish for the inconsistenent office system .
also , urban designers and farmer are very interested .
they even bring funding to one .
one thing you already know has been seen , there &apos;s a lot of mine .
there are lots of businesses who would like to go into america , especially a place with a free-trade zone , and there are many people who like to live there .
around the world , there are 700 million people who say they want to live in a different place .
a million people come to latin america every year and go to the united states .
many of them are fathers who are forced to bring their families back to work , sometimes they &apos;re single mothers who have to make enough money to be able to eat and clothes .
unfortunately , sometimes it &apos;s even children who are trying to find their parents that they haven &apos;t seen in some cases since then .
so what is the idea of thinking about building a completely new city ?
or even , frankly , building from these cities to build or hundreds of things around the world ?
so what is it for an idea to insist that every family has a choice between several cities that are in competition around new residents ?
this is an idea worth spreading .
my friends from honduras were asked to say , thank you , ted .
you know how many choices you do in a typical day ?
you know how many choices you meet in a typical week ?
i &apos;ve done a poll recently with over 2,000 americans , and the average number of choices that make a typical american do a day is 43 .
also recently , a study has been done with ceos in which they watched the ceo for a week .
and these scientists have just documented the different themes with these ceo , and how much time they spent decisions with the issues .
and they found that a average ceo is working on the week with 139 assignments .
each of these issues , of course , was out of many , many smaller decisions .
50 percent of their decisions were made within nine minutes or less .
just for about 12 percent of their decisions , they needed an hour or more of their time .
think of your own decisions .
do you know how many choices you meet in the nine minutes of the category in the one hour ?
how good do you think , are you making decisions ?
today , i &apos;d like to talk about one of the biggest decision-making problems of our modern time , the decision problem .
i want to talk about the problem , and some possible solutions .
now , if i talk about this problem , i &apos;ll ask you some questions , and i want to know your answers .
if i ask you a question , raise it , because i &apos;m blind , just the hand if you want to burn some calories .
otherwise , i ask you , if i ask you a question , and your answer is yes , my first question is : are you ready to hear about the decision problem ?
thank you .
when i was a graduate student at stanford university , i went to this very , very exclusive life-shop ; at least he was really exclusive .
it was a store that was draeger .
this business , it was almost like a pleasure level .
they had 250 different kinds of mustard and vand over 500 different kinds of fruit and vegetables and more than two dozen different kinds of water -- and that was a time when we were actually drinking water .
i loved to go to this business , but at a time i asked myself , well , how come you never buy anything ?
here &apos;s the olive oil gang .
they had about 75 different varieties of olive oil , including those who were locked in boxes including a thousand years old olive trees .
so i decided to go to the criminals one day , and i asked the ladder , &quot; does this model work , that they really offer all these possibilities ? &quot;
and he showed up on the bus charges of tourists who came every day and usually had their cameras .
we decided to do an experiment and we chose marmelade for our experiment .
here &apos;s her marmelke gang .
they had 348 different types of marmelade .
we put a little discount right on the entrance of business .
we put six different tastes there , or 24 different tastes of flavor , and we &apos;ve looked at two things : first , i guess what would be more people and try to stop marmelade ?
there are more people left when it was 24 , about 60 percent when it was six , about 40 percent .
and after that , we looked at which people were more likely to buy a glass of marmelade .
now we saw the reverse effect .
the people who stayed there were 24 percent actually bought a glass of marmelade .
and the people who stayed when they were six , now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a glass of glass .
now , if you calculate it , people bought six times a glass of marmelade , who you had six to choice when you had 24 to vote .
now , to don &apos;t buy a glass of marmelade is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our tadal -- but it turns out that the decision-making problem is going to affect us in very competitive decisions .
we don &apos;t decide to decide , even if it comes to our best interests .
so to the theme of the day , saving savings .
i &apos;m going to tell you a study that i &apos;m going to do with gur huberman , eme kamenica , wei jang , in which we were doing the decisions for retirement plans for almost a million americans in the entire united states .
and what we were looking at was whether the number of the cafeteria officials were possible a retirement plan , the 401 plan , the likelihood of whether more tomorrow is saved .
and we found that there was a correlation in fact .
so in these plans , we had about 657 plans the people offered anything between two to 59 different funds .
and what we found was that the more funding was offered , that , in fact , the participation rate was lower .
now if you look at the extreme , the plans , the two funds , they had a subtraction in the seventh &apos; 90s -- still not as high as we want .
in the plans that are offered nearly 60 fund , the submission went to about the sixth percent of the percentage .
now , it turns out that even if you get to participate , if there were more options for choice , even then it &apos;s got negative consequences .
so , the people who decided to participate in the way that the more possibilities were available to them , the more they were able to do it , and to choose the funds .
the more opportunities they were available , the more they put their money in pure cash accounts .
none of these extreme decisions , to the decisions that someone would recommend if you care about the future financial well-being .
now , in the last 10 years , we &apos;ve observed with people three essential consequences that lead to more and more choices .
they move the decision -- push it up , even if it comes to your own best interest .
they &apos;re more willing to make worse decisions -- worse financial and bad health decisions .
they &apos;re more likely to decide for things that make them less satisfied themselves , even if they make it objective .
the main reason for this is that we may enjoy this huge rainfall of mayonaise , mustard , electrical and marmelade , but we can &apos;t draw the comparison and then actually pick up the amazing supply .
so what i &apos;d like to suggest to you today is four simple techniques -- techniques that have tested in different ways and different research sites -- they just can apply in their business .
first , careful .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it never happened to be true than that .
people are always worried when i say &quot; simple . &quot;
they &apos;re always worried about losing the area .
but in fact , we see more and more and more and more and more and more that if you &apos;re ready to be too narrow , and the unimportant possibilities are , now there &apos;s a rise of sales , it &apos;s going to reduce the cost of the cost of congress .
as a proctor and gamble , the different head and vamspecies of 26 reduced , they experienced one increase of the sales around 10 percent .
when the golden cat corporation were sold to her 10 at the worst , they were experiencing that the winning for 87 percent -- a result of selling the rise of the sales and the reduction of cost .
you know , the average supermacrt today gives you 45,000 products .
a typical walmart gives you today 100,000 products .
but the nine-foot supermarket , today &apos;s largest supermarket in the world is aldi , and they &apos;re only offering them 1,400 products -- a kind of tomato sauce in doses .
now in the world of savings , i think of one of the best examples that came out on the market recently , about how to do the best choice of manclaman , was something that david laoneson has been doing , it &apos;s a program that is offered at harvard .
every single harvard harvard , automatically , takes in a lifetime of life .
the ones who really want to make a choice will be offered 20 fund , not 300 or more fund .
you know how people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to fix it .
it &apos;s all important opportunities . &quot;
and the first thing i ask the employees is , &quot; tell me how the possibilities are different from each other .
and if their employees don &apos;t give them apart , they can &apos;t do it either . &quot;
now before we started lunch today , i had a conversation with gary .
and gary said that he would be willing to offer all the people in this audience for the most beautiful part of the world .
here &apos;s a description of the road .
and i want to read to you .
and now i &apos;m going to give you a couple of seconds to read and then i ask you to clap if you &apos;re willing to take gary &apos;s ads .
okay . everyone is willing to take gary &apos;s ads .
are they all ?
well , let me show you something more of it .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
now , who is ready for this journey .
i think i may have heard more hands .
good .
in fact , it &apos;s objective to the first time that we had more information than the second time , but i would make it a car that they found it in the second time .
because the images had it for them .
what brings me to the second technology that helps you deal with the problem of decision-making is the specitization .
it &apos;s about the fact that people to understand the difference between options need to understand which consequences are associated with the individual possibilities and that these consequences have to be vivid and concrete .
why are people spending about 15 to 30 percent more if they use an ecxy card or a credit card than in cash ?
because it doesn &apos;t really feel money .
and it turns out that if you can make it a little bit more concrete , it &apos;s a very good tool to get people to save more .
so in a study that i did with shlomo benartzi and alessandro bose tero , we &apos;ve made a study with the people who &apos;ve been working on hair -- employees , who have all worked for their pension , and these people were all in a gathering of their pension plan .
and during that meeting , we have this meeting right now as you &apos;ve been , just we &apos;ve added a small thing .
the small thing that we added was that we asked people to think about all the positive things that would happen in their lives when they save money .
in that we did this simple thing , there was a rise of participation around 20 percent , and there was a rise of the number of people who were willing to save or a rise to four percent of the amount that they were willing to pay for for savings accounts .
third technology : categorzation .
we can do better with more categories than with more choices .
here &apos;s , for example , a study that we &apos;ve done in a timeline .
it turns out it &apos;s the top of the supermarkets up and down in the northeast area , variation between 331 different kinds of magazines to 664 magazine .
but you know what ?
if i show you 600 chapters , and you put them in 10 categories , or i &apos;ll show you 400 journals , and those in 20 categories , you think i &apos;ve given you more choices and a better choice , when i gave you the 400 .
because categories tell me how to keep them apart .
here are two different hunters .
one is called &quot; jazz &quot; and the other is called &quot; eureka . &quot;
if you think it &apos;s the left ad of the left , and the ad on jazz is , you clap into your hands .
okay , there &apos;s a couple .
if you think that the one on the left is jazz and the one on the right , you &apos;re clapping , please .
okay , a few more .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
the one on the left is jazz and the right , but you know what ?
this is a high-speed unuseful categorization .
the categories have to say something to the voters , not to provide the choice .
and this problem you see often when you look at the long lists of all of these funds .
who do you really want to inform ?
my fourth technology : assumption for complexity .
it turns out we can actually handle more information than we think we need to simplify them .
we need to slowly increase complexity .
i &apos;ll show you one example of what i mean .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : the purchase of a car .
here &apos;s a german automaker , which gives you the opportunity to conprove your car completely .
you have to make 62 different decisions to design your car completely .
now these are different decisions in the number of choices that they provide per choice .
car color , foreign color -- i have 56 possibilities .
motors -- four options .
what i &apos;m doing now is i change the order in which the decisions appear .
half the customers will go from the many possibilities , 56 car colors to low possibilities , four motors .
the other half of the customers goes from the low possibilities , four motors , to the 56 car colors , many possibilities .
what am i looking at ?
how interest you are .
if you &apos;re constantly using the standard choice in the decision , it means that they will be challenged , the most sacred , i &apos;ll lose it .
what you &apos;re finding is that people who are going to go from the many to the very low choices and over and over again is the standard choice .
we lose it .
go from the little choice to the many , then you lose it .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
the only thing i did is change the order in which this information is being presented .
when i start with the simple starting , i learn how to choose .
even though the motors choose , i don &apos;t have anything about my preferences in the inner equipment , it &apos;s still making me choose .
it also puts me into excitement about the big product i &apos;m putting together , and so i &apos;m willing to make sure to be interested in that .
let me summarize .
i &apos;ve told you about four techniques that solve the problem of decision-making overpower -- -- they &apos;re going to get rid of the overliquid alternatives ; concrete -- make it real ; we can do better with more categories , less possibilities .
each of these techniques that i &apos;m going to describe to you today is to help you to support the possibilities -- good for you , you can use them for yourself , good for the people they offer service .
because i think that the key to the best possible choice is you &apos;re choosing choice .
and the more we choose picking , the better we &apos;re going to be able to practice the art of choice .
thank you .
hi . i &apos;m kevin allocca , trends-manager with youtube , i look at youtube videos .
that &apos;s true .
today , we want to talk about how videos are scattered , and then that &apos;s why it &apos;s important at all .
we all want to be stars -- celebrities , singers , friendans -- when i was young , that seemed infinitely difficult .
but web videos allow us to be able to get all of our creative activities in a part of the culture of our world .
every single one of you may be famous about the internet to the next saturday .
but on youtube , more than 48 hours of video are uploaded a minute .
it &apos;s only going to be a tiny percentage of a tiny percentage , and it &apos;s seen thousands and thousands of times and so on .
so how does this work ?
three things : tastemaker , subpity communities and the unexpected .
well , then we want to .
oh my god . oh my god .
oh my god !
woah !
whohhhh , wowwww !
last year , laparovasquez took this video that he filmed in front of his house in yosemi.
it was 23 million times looking at it .
this chart shows how it looked like the video was popular for the first time .
actually , liz didn &apos;t want to make a chemical video .
he just wanted to share one rainbow .
because you &apos;re doing this , if you &apos;re doing yosemiand you &apos;re doing it .
he had uploaded a lot of natural videos .
and this video actually had been sent already in january .
what &apos;s happened here ?
there was jimmy kimmel .
jimmy kimmel sened the tweet that made the video so popular .
because tastemaker like jimmy kimmel hire new and interesting things and show them a big audience .
it &apos;s friday , friday . gotta get down on friday on friday .
rebecca blacks &quot; friday &quot; is one of the most popular videos of the year .
it was almost 200 million times .
this is what the chart looked like .
just like &quot; double storm &quot; it seems to be nothing .
what happened to this day ?
well , it was friday , that &apos;s right .
if you want to know , these other peaks are also free .
but what about this day , this particular friday ?
well , tosh.0 lawdid , so many blogs started writing about it .
michael j. nelson , by the rockefeller science theater , was a first one who made a joke on twitter .
it &apos;s important that one person or a group of tasteworks took a point of view , with a big audience shared and translated the process .
and then this community of people who shared this great insiver joke , and started talking about it and playing it around .
now there are 10,000 remixes of &quot; friday &quot; on youtube .
already in the first seven days there was a paroder for every week .
unlike the 20th century conversation of the 20th century , the community &apos;s participation is to become part of this phenomenon -- either by spreading it or something new from it .
&quot; nyan m&quot; is animation and music in endless loop .
that &apos;s it , just .
this year was almost 50 million times .
and if you think that &apos;s crazy for crazy , your knowledge is that there &apos;s a three-hour version that has been looked at four million times .
even cats look at this video .
cats look at cats , looking at this video .
it &apos;s important that creativity , the creativity that exists in the internet culture of technology and geeks .
there were remixes .
somebody made an old-fashioned version of it .
and then it became international .
a whole new community shot out of the ground that made it from a stupid joke that we can all participate in .
today we don &apos;t just find pleasure in something we do .
who could have seen it all ?
who would be able to predict &quot; double rainbow or rebecca black or &quot; nyan m&quot; ?
what kind of books are you able to write your writing in that it is ?
in a world where every minute two days of video is uploaded , it can only be really unique and unexpected forms like the videos .
i &apos;m not a very interested , i was not really interested in having a friend , i &apos;m going to give you this great video , about a guy who protested in new york against bicycles .
i got a ticket , because i didn &apos;t drive on my bike , but often there are disabilities that don &apos;t keep driving on the bike .
and that &apos;s really surprising and humorous , casey niestonia became funny idea , and his argument five million times .
this approach is true for everything we do .
and all that leads us to one big question ...
what does that mean ?
whohhh .
what does that mean ?
tastemaker , creative community communities , completely unexpected , are the characteristics of a new kind of media and culture that everybody has access to and in the audience .
as i said , one of the biggest stars -- justin bieber -- did his beginning with youtube .
no one has to give your ideas green .
and today we &apos;re all feeling as the owners of our pop culture .
and these are not the characteristics of the old media and they &apos;re also not hitting the media of today , but they &apos;re going to determine the conversation of the future .
thank you .
how can i talk in 10 minutes about the interconnectedness between women about three generations , and how the amazing strength of these connectedness will be in a four-year girl &apos;s life , when they were about 30 years ago with their little sister , their mother and their grandmother , and they were hanging together in a small boat in the chinese , and they &apos;re going to be in a small boat , the little girl who was in san francisco and their grandmother .
the story is not over .
it &apos;s a puzzle that will be put together .
i want to tell you about some of the puzzle of the puzzle .
imagine the first piece : a man who burns his life .
he &apos;s a poet , a writer , a man whose whole life was held by the simple hope of unity and freedom of his home .
hold it on the rise of the communist in saigon , as he has to be , that his life had been a single waste .
the words , as long as his friends , spoiled now .
he moved into silence .
he died through the history .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i never met him personally .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
my grandmother never forgot my life .
i had to worry that it was not free , and it was my job to learn that the story was not trying to crush us , but we were overstanding .
the next piece of the puzzle shows how a boat in the early morning is going to look at sea .
my mother may was 18 when her father died -- already in an arranged marriage , already with two little girls .
for them , life gave her a challenge : the escape of her family and a new life in australia .
it was totally excluded that it could fail to fail .
after a four-year-old and film saga , there &apos;s a boat silent on the sea as fishing boat .
all the adults were aware of the risks .
the biggest fear they had before pirates , rape and death .
like most adults on the boat , my mother was wearing a little toxic bottle .
in a capst , only my sister would have , and i would drink it and my grandmother .
my first memories are from this boat -- stesty tuckers of the engine , the clapping of each wave on the bug , the vast and empty horizon .
i don &apos;t remember the pirate , which was a lot of times , but of the death of the death of the men on our boat , or in the case of the engine that didn &apos;t want to launch six hours .
but i remember the lights of oil platform in front of the cassini coast , and in the young man , who broke up and died , the end of the journey was too much for him , and the taste of the first x , which gave me one of the men on the platform .
no apple ever broke again .
after three months in a refugee camp , we landed in melbourne .
and the next piece of the puzzle is about four women in three generations , connecting together a new life .
we put ourselves in football ridge , one of the laborers of class , whose population of imdomtenous layers is made .
in other words , in the ancient grade class , the existence of which was completely unknown to me , there was no problem in football ray .
the smells of the grasses came from the rest of the world .
and the fat went to the english of english between people who had one thing in common : they started fresh .
my mother worked on farms , and then in a car station in a car factory , six days , double layers .
it kind of managed to find the time to get english and i.profits .
we were poor .
every dollar was divided , and it was put into another training for english and mathematics , no matter what we had to do for it , mostly the new things that came out of the second .
two strands for school , every one to cover the holes in the other .
a high school uniform to the buttons , because it had to be six years .
and there was the rare but painful chore of &quot; bad eye &quot; and there , and there &apos;s drawing paintings .
after home , where ?
something caught up in me .
there was a meeting to reconciliation and a calm voice said , &quot; i &apos;m going to go out of the way . &quot;
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
my mother was exhausted every night , but we told each other from our day , and listened to the movements of our grandmother in the house .
my mother suffered from nightdreaming the boat .
and it was my job to stay awake every night until the marmarmares came , so i could make it .
she opened a computer business , and then she made a cosist education , and she opened up a business .
and the women came up with their stories about men who didn &apos;t wear the change , angry and unflexible , and sorate children , caught between two worlds .
loans and sponsors were picked up .
centers were built .
i lived in parallel worlds .
in one of them , i was the classic asian student , who turned out to himself .
in the other , i was living in uncertain life that wore tragic scars of violence , of the drug abuse and the isolated .
but so many years of aid .
and because of this help , i was struck in my last year of judaism as a boy of the year .
and i became a piece of the puzzle for the next catapulc , and the edges didn &apos;t get together .
tan le , anonymous strangers of football , was now tan le , refugee and social activist , who was invited to talk to places they had never heard , and in homes , they never could have imagined .
i was not familiar with etiping .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the bribe .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i wanted to go back to the routine , and the comfort of life of an unknown preorts -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters who &apos;d come up with each of their days as well as 20 years by telling each other their stories and slept in the same bed .
i told my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
she reminded me that now i was as old as she had when we walked the boat .
no has been an opportunity .
&quot; just do it , &quot; she said . &quot; and not what you &apos;re not . &quot;
so i talked about jugenesis and training , and they were neglected to the marginalized and dismission .
and the more open i spoke , the more i should tell .
i met people in all life , so many of them did what they loved , living on the borders of the possible .
and although i had my degree , i realized i couldn &apos;t find myself with a career in jura .
there had to be another puzzle piece .
and i realized at the same time that it &apos;s okay to be a community , a newcoling , new in the picture -- not just okay , but something you need to be grateful , maybe a gift of the ship .
because there are so easily to collapse to collapse of the horizontal , so easily that it makes assumptions of the environment .
i &apos;ve now gone enough from my comfort to know that , yes , the world breaks apart , but not how to fear it .
possibilities that wouldn &apos;t have been allowed were damaged .
there was a energy , an unpleasant optimism , a strange mix of the humility and the awaan .
so i followed my gut feeling .
i collected a little team of people around me , which is not a resident challenge .
for a year we didn &apos;t have a cent .
at the end of every day i &apos;m a giant giant soup that we shared .
we worked into the night late .
most of our ideas were crazy , but it was a few brilliant people , and we did the breakthrough .
i met the decision to pull in the u.s.
after just one journey there .
my gut sensation again .
three months later , i moved up and the adventure went on .
before i leave the talk , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
it grew up at a time , in the confucianism , the social norm , and the local prime person was the most important person .
life had not changed for centuries .
her father died shortly after her birth .
her mother moved her alone .
with 17 , she was the second woman of a prime , whose mother she proposed .
without the support of her husband , she was worried for a hard , and she was able to put it in front of court , and she was a greater passion when she won .
&quot; it turns out it &apos;s not true .
i just heard in a hotel room in sydney when she died . 1,000 miles away in melbourne .
i looked through the shocking wall and looked at them on the other side .
i knew she came to watch .
my mother called me a few minutes later .
a few days later , we went into a buddhist temple in football , and we sat around her sarg .
we told her stories , and we told her we were still in her .
by midnight , the monk came and said he had to close the chg .
my mother asked us to grab her hand .
she asked the monk , &quot; why is your hand so warm and the rest of it is so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because you &apos;ve been holding it tomorrow , &quot; he said .
&quot; they didn &apos;t leave it . &quot;
if there &apos;s a band in our family , it goes through the women .
you see who we were , and how life evolved us , we can now see that the men who might have been in our lives , we &apos;d come to the source .
defeat would have been too simple .
now i &apos;d like to have my own children , and i still think of the boat .
who would ever wish ?
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of privilege of suffering , prior to suffering .
can i give you a bug in your life , the courageous of any wave , the unaccounted , steed tuckers of the engine , the vast horizon , nothing ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give this , and it might be safe , i would do it .
in addition , mother &apos;s mother is in the fourth or fifth row .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
is it all photography ?
because , of course , this is a picture you can do with his camera .
nevertheless , my interest in photography began when i got my first digital camera , at age 15 .
i combined it with my former love for drawing , but it was a little different , because using the camera , the camera was actually in planning .
and if you take a picture with a camera , the process ends up when you squeeze on the trigger .
so for me , photography seemed more about going right to the right place at the right time .
i believed everybody could .
so i wanted to create something different , something where the process is going to start .
photographs like this : a building site along the road a lot of a road .
but it has an unexpected twist .
and nevertheless , a realistic level .
or photographs like this -- dark and colorful , but all with the common goal , to keep a realistic level .
if i say reality , i mean photoreality .
because , of course , she &apos;s not something that you really can capture , but i want to let it look like you could have , on a photograph .
photographs where you have to think a brief moment to figure out the trick .
so it &apos;s more about catching an idea of really a moment .
but what is the trick that makes it realistic ?
is it about the details or the colors ?
is it about the light ?
what creates the illusion ?
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
but ultimately , it &apos;s about how we interpret the world , and how it can be done on a two-dimensional range .
it &apos;s not about what is realistic , but what we think is realistic .
so i think the basic ones are very simple .
i see them as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces and put it together to create an alternative reality .
and let me show you a simple example .
we have three perfect imaginable physical objects that we can identify all of us in a three-dimensional world .
but in a certain way , you can combine something that &apos;s still going to look like three-dimensional , like it might exist .
but at the same time , we know that &apos;s not possible .
so we oversign our brains , because our brain simply doesn &apos;t accept that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
and i see the same process in combining photographs .
it &apos;s really just about combining different realities .
so the things that make a picture realistic , i think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t think about , the things around us .
but if we combine photographs , it &apos;s really important to think about it , because otherwise you just see it wrong .
so i would say that there are three simple rules to follow a realistic outcome .
as you can see , these aren &apos;t three special images .
but they can combine something special like this .
so the first rule is that combinated photos should have the same view .
secondly , combinated photos should have the same lighting species .
and these two images meet these two sets -- from the same altitude , and the same lighting .
third of all , it &apos;s about making it impossible to distinguish where the individual images begin and end by connecting them seamlessly .
it doesn &apos;t make it possible to say how the photo was put together .
so by looking at color , contrast and helliness to the edges of the individual images , it explores fish , like the depth of depth , desatiing colors and disorders , we send the boundaries between the various images and the kind of a photograph , even though a picture can look like hundreds of levels .
here &apos;s another example .
you might think that this is just a landscape of land , and the bottom part was manipulated .
but this picture is actually completely interconnected , from photographs of different places .
i personally , personally , that it &apos;s easier to create a place than to find a place because you don &apos;t have to make any compromise with the ideas in your head .
but it requires a lot of planning .
and when i had this idea in winter , i knew i needed several months to plan the different places for the puzzle of the puzzle .
for example , the fish was taken on a ananerery trip .
the bank is from a different place .
the underwater part comes from a rock bottle .
and yes , i &apos;ve even wrapped the house up on the top of the island to allow it to look at sulfur .
so to get a realistic outcome , it looks at me on planning .
i always start with a deal , an idea .
it &apos;s about the combination of the different images .
and here &apos;s a piece of very well planned .
and then when you make good images , the result can be pretty beautiful , and pretty realistic .
so there are all the tools there , and the only thing that lies us is our imagination .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to talk to you about why so many electronic health projects failed .
and i think the most important point is that we stopped talking to our patients .
and one of the things that we introduced to the radboud university was to put a major audience .
it &apos;s not very scientific to do -- it &apos;s a cup of coffee or tea , and the patients , family , relatives , &quot; how does it go ?
how can we help you ? &quot;
and we think we want to think that this is one of the main problems , why all of the electronic health projects failed , because we stopped listening .
this is my wlan-waage . a very simple thing .
she &apos;s got a button .
and every morning i get out of it .
and yes , i have a job , you might recognize .
i put my job on 95 pounds .
it &apos;s going to work very simple : every time i go to the waa , you send my data on google health .
and that &apos;s where you get from my local physician , so that you can see where my weight problem is , not just in the moment i have kardiological support or something like that , but also with a look into the past .
but there &apos;s something else .
maybe you &apos;re familiar with this , i &apos;ve got over 4,000 scenarios of people on twitter .
so every morning i go to my wlan-waage , and people talk to me before i &apos;m sitting in the car , &quot; to lunch just a little bit today , lucien . &quot;
but that &apos;s the supreme thing that can happen , because this is the group compforced , group educated to help patients , because that could be used against obesity , or it could be used patients .
but it could also be used to get people out of their chairs , and to get them to play some kind of play , to control their health better .
next week , it comes to the market .
it &apos;s going to give you this little blood pressure device that you put on an iphone or something .
and it will allow people to measure their blood pressure from home to send them to their doctor and share it with others for more than 100 dollars .
at this point , the patients come into play . they can &apos;t just take control of the control , captain on their own ship , but can also help us with health care in the face of the challenge that we have , and the costs of health care , twice demand .
make ways that are easy to use and start to hug patients in the team .
and you can do that through these techniques , but by crowdsourcing .
and one of the things we did , i &apos;d like to share with you a quick video .
we have all the navigational systems in our cars .
maybe in our mobile phones .
we know exactly where all the money engines are around maastricht .
we still know one , where all the gas vessels are .
and sure , we can find food chains .
but where would the next aed to help this patient ?
we &apos;ve been wondering , and nobody knew .
no one knew where the next life-saving aed was at this moment .
so what did we do ? we did crowdsourcing in the netherlands .
we built a website , and we asked a human mass , &quot; if you see an aed , please share it with where he &apos;s closed , &quot; because sometimes he &apos;s closed during business times , of course .
and over 10,000 aeds became already in the netherlands .
the next step was to find apps for it .
and we designed an ion app .
we developed an app for layar , augmented reality to find these aeds .
and if you &apos;re in a city like maastricht , and someone collapses , you can use your iphone , and within the next couple of weeks , your micropost-cell phone can save the next aed life .
and today , we don &apos;t just want to do this as aed4u , as the product calls itself , but as aed4us .
and we want to bring this to a global scale .
and we ask our colleagues around the world , from other universities , to help us behave like kise points around the world around the world .
and if you &apos;re in vacation and someone breaks together , it &apos;s your own relatives or somebody else , you can find a aed .
the other thing that we want to ask is that companies are helping us all over the world to mimic these aeds .
these could be humorous , or technicians for example , just to make sure that the geed is still on his place .
please help us and try and make it not just to improve health .
thank you .
today i &apos;m going to report from unexpected discoveries .
i work in solar technology .
and my little startup wants us to force the environment by making ...
... it tends to crowdsource .
here &apos;s a quick video about what we do .
oh . a moment .
it may take you to be charged .
now -- we can just skip this -- i &apos;m just going to cut the video off .
no .
that &apos;s not ...
okay .
solar technology is ...
oh , my time is already over ?
okay . thank you .
so a couple of years ago , i started a program to get the stars in technology and design to take a year back and work in a environment that &apos;s so pretty much everything you hate , we &apos;ve got it in the government .
the program is called code for america , and it &apos;s a bit like the peace plant for computer geeks .
we choose a few fellows every year , and we &apos;re working with cities .
instead of sending them into the third world , we send them in rathins .
and they developed great apps , working with urban workers .
but what they really do is show what &apos;s possible today with technology .
so they meet al
al is a hydrant in the city boston .
here it looks like he &apos;s looking for a date , but what he really looks like is someone who &apos;s free to him when he &apos;s in his name , because he knows he &apos;s not very good at branding when he &apos;s covered by a foot snow .
how did he get to look at this particular kind of help ?
we had a team of fellows last year in boston , the code for america program .
they were there in february , and it &apos;s got a lot of fun last february .
and they realized that the city never weighs that hydrant window .
but a particular fellow , a man named erik newels obhe , found something else , and that was that the residents were running the sidewalks , right before these parts .
so he did what every good developer would do , he wrote an app .
it &apos;s a nice little app , where you can defeat a hydrant hydrant .
you make him free to fire , if it fails .
if you do that , you can give it a name , and he called the first al .
if you don &apos;t do that , somebody can take you away .
so there &apos;s a nice little game dynamic .
this is a modest little app .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of the 21 apps that the fellows written in the last year .
but she does something that no other government technology does .
it &apos;s spreading out .
there &apos;s this guy honolulu in the city of honolulu , who has seen that he could use this app , not for snow , but to the citizens of the tsunami .
it &apos;s very important that this tsunami works , but the people steal the batteries .
so he got the citizens to check it .
and then we decided to use seattle , to use the app to clean the citizens to clean the fishermen .
and chicago has just introduced it to the people running the box when it fails .
we now know nine cities that are planning to use this app .
and it has been self-evident , organic , of course .
if you know something about government technology , you know it &apos;s not going to happen .
the creation of software takes a few years into the rule .
we had a team that worked last year at a project in boston for three , two months .
it was about a method that the parents can find out what the right public schools are for their children .
we &apos;ve been told later that if it was going about the normal channels , it took over two years , and it would have paid over two million dollars .
and that &apos;s nothing yet .
there &apos;s a project right now in california at the moment that the taxpayer paid two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this on every level of government .
so an app that &apos;s written in a couple of days , and then it &apos;s spread from selering , is a kind of a shot of the rings on the institution of the government .
it shows how the government could work better -- no longer like a private company , how many people think it should .
and not even like a tech company , but rather like the internet itself .
and that means free access , which means open and productive .
and that &apos;s important .
but more importantly , that app is that you represent a new generation , the government &apos;s problem -- not as the problem of a sales institution , but as a problem of collective action .
and this is a very good news , because it turns out we &apos;re very good in collective engineering with digital technology .
now there &apos;s a big community of people making the tools that we need to put things together in common .
it &apos;s not just code for america , &quot; fellows , there are hundreds of people around the country who are getting up and writing government apps , every day in their own communities .
they didn &apos;t give up the government .
they &apos;re horrible frustrated with her , but they don &apos;t complain it , repair them .
and these people know what we &apos;ve lost from the eyes .
and that &apos;s when you all forget your feelings about politics and the snake office and all the other things that we really forget about , is government , in the words , in the words of tim o , which we can &apos;t do alone . &quot;
now a lot of people gave up the government .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , i want you to think about it because things change .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; government is in change .
and because the government is ultimately taking their strength out of us -- remember , &quot; we the people ? &quot; -- how we think about it will affect how this change happens .
i didn &apos;t know much about government when i started this program .
and as a lot of people , i thought it was mainly about making people go into office .
now after two years , i &apos;ve come to the conclusion that it was mostly about local communities .
this is the call center for service and information .
you usually get out of your town when you get 311 .
if you ever have the chance to work in your city in your city , like your fellow scott silverman as a part of the program -- in fact , you &apos;re doing all of that -- you &apos;re going to see that people who are calling the government for many different problems , including many different problems .
so scott gets this anfruf .
he &apos;s called &quot; thylacine &quot; in the official database .
and he doesn &apos;t really have an idea . he &apos;s beginning to start with animal vessel .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , can you just open up all the doors in your house and play very loud music and see if that &apos;s the raw skin ? &quot;
and that worked . spend for scott .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the thylacine .
boston didn &apos;t just call a call center .
it has an app , a web and mobile app , called &quot; injeture . &quot;
we didn &apos;t write this app .
this is the work very clever people in the office of the new urban .
one day -- that &apos;s a real report -- came into this : &quot; thylacines in my trash . can &apos;t say if she &apos;s dead .
how do i get them away ? &quot;
but what happens to &quot; proconnect &quot; is different .
scott understopped human beings .
but on &quot; stockconnect &quot; is all public , so everybody can see it .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
and the next slide we get was , &quot; i went over there , found the garbage garbage behind the house .
thylacine ? yes . selfish ? yap .
turned the trash on the site . went home .
good night , honey thylacine . &quot;
pretty simple .
this is great . this is the digital .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how the government is getting into crowdsourcing .
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
and i &apos;m not necessarily talking about a technical definition of the platform .
i &apos;m more talking about a platform for people to help themselves and help others .
a citizen helped another citizen , but the government played a central role here .
they combined these two people .
and you could have put them together with government services if these were needed , but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative to government services .
if a neighbor is helping the other , we make our communities .
let &apos;s call the animal vessel , it costs a lot of money .
one of the most important things is that we need to think about government is not the same as politics .
and most people understand it , but they believe that one is the input of the other .
that our contribution to the system is to vote .
how often did we choose a political leader -- and sometimes we use a lot of energy to choose a new political leaders -- and then we &apos;re going to go back and we expect the government to reflect our values , and then don &apos;t change much ?
this is because the government is more like an ocean , and politics is the top 158 .
and what is below is what we call bureaucracy .
and we use this word with such contempt contempt .
but it &apos;s this contempt , that this thing we own , and for that we pay for , is something that works against us , something else , and then we did ourselves .
people seem to think politics is sexy .
if we want this institution to work for us , we need to have bureaucracy .
because that &apos;s where the real government is happening .
we need to rely on the machine &apos;s machine .
so the accumulation movement has done it .
you saw these guys ?
it &apos;s a group of people who wrote a very detailed 325 page report , which is an answer to the sec memo about law reform .
it &apos;s not political , it &apos;s active to be active .
now , for those of us who have given up the government , it &apos;s time we think about the world that we want to leave our children .
you have to imagine the enormous challenges that you have to imagine .
do we really believe that we &apos;re reaching what we need to do without improving the institution in the names of all of us ?
a government is absolutely necessary , but it needs to be more efficient .
the good news is that technology makes it possible to dramatically indicate the function of government in a way that can actually achieve the society .
and there &apos;s a generation that has grown up on the internet , and it knows that it &apos;s not so hard to do things together , you have to build the very systems .
now the average age of our fellows is 28 , so i am , unfortunately , almost a generation older than most of you .
this is a generation that grew up with their voice as granted .
they &apos;re not fighting that battle that we &apos;re all fighting , about who gets to speak ; they &apos;re all allowed to talk .
you can make your opinion , at any channel at any channel , and you do .
so if you &apos;re faced with the problem of government , you don &apos;t care about using your voices .
they use their hands .
they use their hands to write applications that improve the government of government .
and these apps allow us to use our hands to improve our communities .
this could be broken up a hydrant window , unsowed to hunter-gathering , turning a glider with a thylacine .
and sure , we would have these hydrant trucks all the time , and a lot of people do .
but these apps are like little digital memories , that we are not only consumers , and we &apos;re not only consumers of government that pay attention to taxes .
we are more than that , we are citizens .
and we &apos;re not going to improve government better until we improve the citizenship .
so the question i have for you all here : if it &apos;s about the big , important things we need to do together , all of us are going to be a lot of voices , or are we going to be a lot of hands ?
thank you .
usually my role is to explain the people how wonderful the new technologies , which are coming up , and i thought , there i am , i &apos;m going to tell you what i really think is . and i &apos;m going to try to see what &apos;s really going on , and i &apos;m going to try and understand what &apos;s really going on .
i &apos;m going to start by showing you a single , boring slide .
... please just show the slide .
this is a slide that i happen to happen from my folder .
it &apos;s not about the details of the slide , it &apos;s rather about the general form .
this slide shows data of a analysis of the performance of risking processors with the performance of a local area networks .
the interesting thing here is that this slide , like so manp , what we often meet in our field , is a kind of a semi-logarithmic curve .
in other words , every step here is a power in the performance scale .
and this is a new fact that we need to use this type of scale on semi-logarithmic curves in technology .
something very strange happens here .
this is essentially what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
so , if you could do the lights again .
another one , because i &apos;m going to draw a little bit on the paper here .
now , why do we draw graphs in technology on 12,000 curves ?
the reason is , if i would draw it on a normal curve , where , let &apos;s say , this is the years , so the timeline of a kind , and this is a direct measure of technology that i want to represent with a graph , then the graph is silly .
that &apos;s what you see .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
now , if i want to record a different technology , let &apos;s say a transportation technology , then it would go on the semi-logarithmic scale very unreasonable , in a flat line .
but if something like this happens here , it changes qualitative conditions .
so , if the transportation technology is expanding as fast as the microprocessor technology , then we could go back into a taxi and we would be in tokyo .
but it &apos;s not that fast .
there &apos;s never been before in the history of the technology development , this kind of recursiem growth , which is going to increase the scale of all few years .
the question i want to ask you is , if you look at these exponential curves , you &apos;re not going to go on forever .
it &apos;s not possible that everything for forever and forever is evolving as fast as now .
there are two ways .
either it gets a classic curve like this , until something completely new , or it &apos;s going to happen here .
that &apos;s it .
well , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think that &apos;s what &apos;s going to happen here .
it &apos;s really like that , it means we are here in the middle of a transition .
we &apos;re here on this line , in a transition from the past world to a new kind of world .
so the question i want to ask you , and i often ask myself , is this new world ?
what is this new state that makes the world slow ?
because the transition seems very , very confusing to be in the middle of it .
when i was a kid , the future was in the year 2000 , and people often talked about what would happen in the year 2000 .
now we have a conference where people talk about the future , and you realize that the future is still in 2000 .
we don &apos;t go further than that .
so in other words , the future has fallen around a year since i &apos;m on this world .
i think the reason is that we realize that anything is going on .
the transition is happening . we can feel it all .
and we know that it just doesn &apos;t make sense to try to look at 30 or 50 years into the future because everything will be so different that a simple high-definition of what we &apos;re doing now doesn &apos;t make sense .
now i want to talk about what that could be , this transition in which we are right now .
to do this , i &apos;m going to first talk about some other things , which have nothing to do with technology or computers .
because i think to really understand this , we need to step back and look at the thing on a longer scale .
and that &apos;s what i want to look at on the scale of life of the earth .
i think the whole picture makes sense when you divide it into some billion steps .
so let &apos;s go back , and that &apos;s 2.5 billion years , the earth was a big , sterile blob of chemicals with lots of chemicals on it .
now , if you look at the way these chemicals were organized , then we have a pretty good picture of how they did it .
i also believe there are theories that begin to understand how to start with rna , but i &apos;m going to tell you a simplified story of what &apos;s going on , which is that there &apos;s a little bit of oil running around with these kinds of recycled chemicals .
some of these oil drobes had a particular combination of chemicals that allowed them to integrate other chemicals from outside and grow .
all the ones that were so , started sharing .
these little oil drods were the most primitive cell form .
but these oil drooms were not about living in today &apos;s senses , because every single one of them was just a small , random recipe of chemicals .
and every time it divided , it turned out to be infinable chemicals .
so every drop was a little bit different .
in fact , dropers grew up , which had an optical composition faster than others and integrated more and more chemicals from outside and shared faster .
so these tend to survive longer and increase them in scale .
so this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but interestingly , when these drops learned a trick about abstraction .
in any way that we don &apos;t quite understand , these drops have the ability to learn information .
they have learned to store the recipe of the cell as information , and in a certain chemical form that we call dna .
in other words , they have found in this intellectual , evolutionary way , a way of which allowed them to make what they were , so that this information could be stored and copied .
the amazing thing about this is to store this kind of information over the age of 2.5 billion years , where they were born .
in fact , the recipe is for us , which is our genes , from exactly the same code and the same writing .
and every organism uses exactly the exact same letters and the same code .
we &apos;re , as far as we can , to be able to write ourselves in this code .
and i &apos;ve got 100 micrograms of a white pulse trying to keep in the airports of security .
there &apos;s -- what i &apos;ve done is i took this code -- the code is made of normal letters , which we use to translate to the symbolic -- and i &apos;ve written my business card on a piece of dna .
so if somebody wants to do a hundred million copies of my business card , i have enough for everyone in this room and even for everyone in the world , and it &apos;s right here .
if i was really a selfish , i would have written it on a virus , and in the room .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
the dewriting dna was an interesting step .
and the nature of these cells -- that made them happy for another billion years .
but then another one happened , very interesting step where things were completely different , so these cells began to communicate and exchange information , so that communities of cells were born .
i don &apos;t know if they knew it , but bacteria can actually replace their dna .
this is the reason why it grows to antibiotics .
some bacteria have figured out how to stay from penicillin and put this information together with other bacteria in the dna and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin because the bacteria communicate with each other .
now this communication allowed the reasons for communities which were in a certain sense in the same boat ; they were synerzers .
so they either survived , or they went together . that meant that if a community was successful , all the individuals of the community are more likely to repeat and prefer from evolution .
the transition is now where these communities are so close together that they decided that they decided to write the recipe for the whole community in a string chain .
and the next interesting phase took about another billion years .
at this point at this point , we have multi-celled communities , communities of many shifts , which together as individual organism .
in fact , we &apos;re also such a large community .
we have a lot of cells that are not on their own .
your skin cells are useless without heart cells , muscle cells , brain cells and so on .
so these communities started developing , so that the level of what evolution was , no longer the single cell , but the cell community that we call organism .
the next step was happening within these communities .
the cell communities began to abstract information again .
and they developed special structures that didn &apos;t do anything else as information within the organism .
and these are the neural structures .
so the neurons are the information system that these cell communities have built .
they started to train in the community in the community , special structures that were responsible for learning and understanding information .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
this gave you an evolutionary advantage .
because at this point , an individual -- learning has happened within the course of the time of a single organism , instead of about this evolutionary period .
so an organism could learn , for example , to eat a certain fruint , because they made fun and made it sick , the last time he ate it .
now , this could happen within the lifetime of a single organism , whereas hundreds of thousands of years were needed because this information must be learned evolutionarily by the individuals that died because of these frudials , because they haven &apos;t been there .
so the nervous system actually has the evolutionary process of this particular information structure , because evolution now could occur within a single part .
it could happen within a time-mal learning frame .
what happened after that is that the individual organisms found a way to communicate each other .
as an example , the most subtle we know of this communication form is the human language .
it &apos;s a pretty amazing invention when you think about it .
i have a very complicated , fuzzy and confusion idea in my head .
i &apos;m sitting here , and i &apos;ll basically give you a funny sign of me in the hope of creating a kind of confused idea in your head , which has a certain similarity with my original idea .
so we take something very complicated , it turns into notes around , a sequence of sound , and it creates something very complicated in the heads of others .
so this allows us to work again as a unified organism .
and what we actually did , we , humanity , is we started abstracting .
we go through the same stages , which have been through multi-cell organisms -- the abstraction of our methods , how we capture data , we present .
for example , the invention of language was a little step in this direction .
telephone , computers , video , cd , cd roms and so on are all our specialty mechanisms that we built in our community to be able to have this information .
and it connects us all together to something that is much bigger , and also able to evolve faster than we &apos;ve been .
so today , evolution can happen in the time of microseconds .
you &apos;ve also seen tys a little bit of evolution where he showed a little evolution in the convolance program , right before your eyes .
so we &apos;ve regraded the timeline again .
the first step of history , which i &apos;ve told you , is a billion years per piece .
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , a few hundred million years .
then the night at night , how language and so forth , less than a million years .
and these next steps , like electronics , seem to be very few decades .
the process of itself is feeding itself , and therefore , i think car catalytic is the word for it -- if something increases its baseline .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
and i think that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing here in this explok-proof view .
we see the process that feeds itself .
i live from building computers and i know that i &apos;m going to use the mechanism that i use to build computers , not using the recently progress in the computer technology .
my current activity is to design objects with such a high complexity that it &apos;s impossible to design this in the traditional sense .
i don &apos;t know what every single transistor is doing in charge machine .
it has billions of them .
what i &apos;m going to do instead , and what the designers of thinking machines do is we think in a certain abstract level , that machine , and the machine makes it something that makes our skills far beyond us .
and she does it partly with methods which we don &apos;t even understand right now .
a way of which is particularly interesting , and what i &apos;ve been using recently , is evolution itself .
we &apos;re buying a evolutionary process in the machine which is happening in the microsecond area .
to give you an example , in the most extreme cases , we can create a program that &apos;s evolved from random inpairtions .
we say , &quot; computers , generic , a hundred million random sequences of instruction .
now i &apos;m going to take all of those randomly elected subjects , take all the programs , and choose those of you who are in the first place of mine . &quot;
so in other words , i first define what i want .
let &apos;s say , i want numbers , that would be a simple example of what i &apos;ve been using for it .
so find programs which can be found at the earliest numbers .
of course , the chance of randomly elected evidence is very small that it &apos;s just a number of numbers , so you can &apos;t actually do the incurtions .
but one of those may be lucky two numbers into the right order .
now , i say , &quot; computers , take the 10 percent of the sequences , which gave my preverse to the next .
the rest of it , the rest of it , the rest of it .
now , we &apos;re all reaching the remaining line that numbers have best sored .
and that &apos;s a way of combining recombined , analog to reproduction . &quot;
take two programs and they produce children through the exchange of their subrtintintines , and the kids are sending the characteristics of subroutintines from the two programs .
so i &apos;ve got a new generation of programs that came through combinations of programs , which have come to a little closer to the prior than others .
say , &quot; please repeat this process . &quot;
they did again .
maybe some mutations take a few .
and this is again with another generation .
all of these generations require only a few milliseconds .
and so i can go through evolution over millions of years in the computer , and in more complex cases , some hours of hours .
finally , i get programs that can give numbers perfect .
in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i could ever have written by hand .
when i look at these programs , i can &apos;t tell you how they work .
i tried to understand them .
it &apos;s denial and strange programs .
but they do the job .
i know , i &apos;m sure you &apos;re doing the job , because they come from a series of thousands of programs , which have the job done .
because your life depended on whether you did the job right .
i sat in a 747 with marvin minsky , which is a map , and he says , &quot; oh look . look at this .
there is , &quot; this airplane is made out of thousands of pieces of small pieces that work together to make your flight safer . does it make you more reliable ? &quot;
we know that a developmental process is not optimal when it becomes too complicated .
so we &apos;re starting to rely on computers for a process which is very different from the classical engineering .
it allows us to do things with a much higher complexity than it would allow the normal methods to produce .
and yet , we don &apos;t even understand the possibilities .
so all the masses of excess is the technology .
we now use these programs to make the computer much faster , so that we can make these processes even faster .
so it comes back to feedback .
it gets faster and faster and i think that &apos;s why it seems so confusing .
because all of these new technologies today are feeding themselves .
we fly off .
we &apos;re at a point that is the analog to then , as a single-cell organisms , evolved to multicell organisms .
so we &apos;re the amobs and we can &apos;t quite make a difference in the hell of the hell .
we &apos;re in the middle of this overline .
but i really think it &apos;s going to come after us .
i think it &apos;s very high to say that we are the final product of evolution .
and i think we &apos;re all part of the creation of what &apos;s next .
well , lunch is before and i think i &apos;m listening to here now before i get picked up .
my story starts right here in rajasthan , about two years ago .
i was under the star sky in the desert with sufide singer , with sufiges ali .
we talked about it that nothing has changed since the age of ancient indian era , &quot; mahabharata . &quot;
if we wanted to travel the indians at the time , we went into a car and threw over the sky .
now we &apos;re doing this with airplanes .
then , when the great indian warrior arjuna had an durst , he took a bow , shot in the floor and water .
now we &apos;re doing it with power and machines .
we came to the conclusion that magic and magic was replaced by machines .
that really made me sad .
i got a fear of technology .
it was scared that i could lose the ability to enjoy the sunset without the camera and without tweet to my friends .
i found that technology should make magic and not kill .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little silver pocket watch .
this piece of 50 years old technology became the most magical thing for me .
it became a gulf access to a world full of pirate and contaminated ships and images in my imagination .
i came up with this when we thought of our fancy clocks and cameras of it .
they were being inspired by that .
and so i went into the world of technology to see how i could use it to make magic rather than killing it .
with 16 , i started illustrate books .
when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a device to define the readers around the world .
it can know how we hold it .
it can know where we are .
it puts images together and text , and animation , sound and touch .
so storytelling always took more sense .
but what do we do with it ?
i &apos;m just going to khoya , a interactive ipad app .
here &apos;s : &quot; put your fingers on every light . &quot;
and so -- here &apos;s , &quot; this box belongs ... &quot; i write my name .
and i &apos;m going to get a character in the book .
and then a letter goes down to me -- and the ipad knows through gps where i live -- that &apos;s right to me .
the kid in me is really excited about this possibility .
i talked a lot about magic .
i don &apos;t mean a magician and kite , but the magic of childhood , those ideas that we all had as children .
fireflies in a glass , i found it pretty exciting .
so you have to blow the ipad up here and get out the fireflies .
and the illuminating way through the rest of the book .
another idea that &apos;s fascinated me as a child is that a whole galaxy can be in a single restaurant .
and so here &apos;s where every book is going to be a little restaurant that i &apos;m going to take to the magic device in the machine .
and this opens up a map .
fantasy books have always had maps , but these cards were static .
this map grows and lighting and serves for guidance in the rest of the book .
it also shows itself in other places .
i &apos;m going in here .
it &apos;s important for me to create something that is essential , but it &apos;s also very noisy .
these are the apsaras .
we &apos;ve heard all feeins and nympes , but how many people outside of india know their indian colleagues , the apsaras ?
the poor apsaras were caught thousands of years in indras camels , in an old bakery .
and we bring them back , in a contemporary history for children .
a story that goes apart with new issues as the environmental crisis .
the environmental crisis , a big problem of the last 10 years , is that kids in their rooms are sitting in their rooms , without going out .
but now with mobile technology , we can take our children into the natural world with their technology .
in an interaction of the book , you &apos;ll find a search . you have to go out and collect the camera of the ipads of natural objects .
as a child , i had collections of story , rocks , kiatoms and snake .
somehow , children don &apos;t do anymore .
this ritual ritual will come back . you have to go out to make a picture of a photograph of a flower and tag .
in another chapter , you have to highlight a piece of construction and tag .
so you actually create a digital collection of photographs that you can do online .
a kid in london shows the picture of a fusion and says , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve seen a fusion . &quot;
a kid in india says , &quot; i &apos;ve seen a monkey . &quot;
this creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photos that you actually did .
there &apos;s a variety of possibilities that make magic and technology connecting together .
in the next book , we &apos;re planning an interaction where we use the video of the ipads , and through augmented reality , an animation looks at elves that appear on a plant before the house .
at one point , the screen filled with leaves .
you have to make the sound of the wind , you remove bubbles and the rest of the box .
we all move to a world where the nature of technology is closer and closer to the magic and technology .
we use the energy of the sun .
we bring our kids closer and closer to the natural world and the magic , fun and love of our childhood through the simple medium of a story .
thank you .
this is really a remarkable honor for me .
i spend most of my time with people in research , prisons or death cells .
i spend most of my time with social weakest in social construction and places where there &apos;s a lot of hope .
to be here at ted , to see and hear how stimulating this is , i gave a lot of force .
in the short time , i got a clear one : ted has identity .
you can tell things that have influence the world .
and sometimes when something happens about ted , it gives you meaning and power that otherwise wouldn &apos;t have .
i say that because i think identity is very important .
we &apos;ve seen some fantastic presentations .
i think we &apos;ve learned that the words of an apprentice have meaning , but the words of a dedicated curriculum are special .
as a doctor , you can do good . as a physician , you can do more .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
i did not learn that in my work as a lawyer .
i learned that from my grandmother .
i became big in a family , a traditional african-american household , who was dominated by a matriarchin , and that matriarch was my grandmother .
she was a bar , strong woman , she had effect .
she had the last word in every family argument .
it was also the starting of many barriers in our family .
she was the daughter of a slave family .
their parents were born in the 1840s in virginia as a slave .
it was born in 1880 , and the experience of slavery shaped a very strong picture .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also loving .
when i met her as a young boy , she came to me and hupped me .
they got me so firm that i could barely breathe . then they let me go .
one or two hours later , when i showed her , she came to me and said , &quot; bryan , do you feel my embrace ? &quot;
and if i said &quot; no &quot; said , &quot; no , put it back . if i said , &quot; yes , let me go .
she was something that was that you wanted to be close to you .
the only problem was they had 10 children .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
sometimes when i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to get her attention .
my cousins were walking around .
i remember , i have to be eight or nine that i woke up one morning and went to the living room . all my cousins were walking around .
my grandmother sat at the end of the room and looked at me .
first of all , i thought that was a game .
i looked at them and smiles , but she was very serious .
and this was about 15 or 20 minutes , and then she stood up , and she came up to me , and she said , &quot; come on , bryan . you and i , we have to talk . &quot;
i remember it was yesterday .
i &apos;ll never forget it .
she took me out , and she said , &quot; bryan , i &apos;ll tell you something , but you have to promise that you don &apos;t go on . &quot;
i said , &quot; promised , grandma . &quot;
she said , &quot; excuse me ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
she sat down and looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to know i &apos;ve seen you . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re something special . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do anything you want to do . &quot;
i &apos;ll never forget that .
and then she said , &quot; you just have to give me three things , bryan . &quot;
i said , &quot; ok , grandma . &quot;
she said , &quot; well , first of all , i want you to always love your mom . &quot;
she said , &quot; mom is my baby , and you must be with promise you &apos;re going to take care of them . &quot;
i said my mother , so i said , &quot; yes , grandma , i &apos;m going to do that . &quot;
and then she said , &quot; next to me , i &apos;m going to say that you &apos;re going to do the right thing , &quot; even though it falls hard to do the right thing .
i thought , &quot; yes , grandma . i promise it . &quot;
and finally she said , &quot; the last thing you have to promise me is &quot; that you &apos;re never going to drink alcohol . &quot;
well , i was nine years old , and so i said , &quot; yes , grandma . i promise it . &quot;
i grew up on the land , in the old , rural south and i have a brother who is older and a year younger sister .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day , my brother came home and brought this six-year-old pack , and i got my sister and i went to the forest .
we just like it around the way .
then he took a beer beer , and he offered my sister one , and she took me , and then she offered me one .
i said , &quot; no , no , no . no . let &apos;s do it . i don &apos;t want a beer . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; now we do . today we do it , you &apos;re doing anything else .
i had something , your sister had what . go , drink a beer . &quot;
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to . just power . just power . &quot;
my brother looked at me .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s wrong with you ? well , you drink what . &quot;
and then he looked at me in the face , and he said , &quot; oh no , you don &apos;t always make you crazy because of the conversation with grandmother ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; grandma told everybody that they &apos;re special . &quot;
i was devastated by the bottom .
i &apos;m going to give you something .
i should not do that .
this may be a public transfer .
i &apos;m a 52 years old , and i &apos;m afraid i &apos;ve never washed a drop of alcohol .
i don &apos;t say that because i think it &apos;s virtuous . i say that &apos;s because identity means .
if we can create the right kind of identity , we can tell people things that they don &apos;t do first .
we can get them to do things that they thought they could not .
of course my grandmother would say all of you , you &apos;re something special .
my grandfather was during the prohibition in prison .
my uncle died of alcohoorganized diseases .
and she believed that this is the themes that we need to care about .
i &apos;ve tried to say something about our justice system .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
in 1972 , 300,000 people were in lianststone and in prison .
today , it &apos;s 2.3 million .
the united states today has the highest incarceration of the world .
seven million people rely on currency , or unconditional crimes .
in my opinion , mass incarcerations are fundamentally changing our world .
in social and black and black parts of the population , despair and hope , because of these changes .
one of three of the black black black in between 18 and 30 is in prison , in prison , or uncondited crimes .
in urban communities all over the country -- from los angeles across philadelphia , baltimore to washington -- there are 50 to 60 percent of all black young men either in prison , in prison , to discurrency .
but our system is not just shaped by questions that have to do with rasthns , and it &apos;s also caused by poverty .
we have a legal system in this country that they treated much better when they &apos;re rich and guilty as poor and innocent .
wealth , not disdebt , it affects the result .
and yet we seem to be very pleased .
a politics of fear and anger has convinced us that these problems are not our problems .
we have lost the contact .
i think it &apos;s interesting .
there are some very interesting developments .
my home state of alabama takes you permanent the election right now when you &apos;re sentenced .
here and today in alabama , 34 percent of the male black population is permanently lost their choice .
we predicted that in 10 years , the rate of the public honor is going to be so high , as we said before the census of the election law .
the silence is delicious .
i offer kids .
many of my clients are very young .
the united states of america , the only country in the world , is the only country in the world to death in prison .
in this country , there are children who live for children , without more complex prevention .
we &apos;ve already run a lot of technology .
the only country in the world .
i offer people in death cells .
the death penalty question is an interesting question .
we believe because you &apos;ve taught us that the real question is : does a human being deserve to die for one of them ?
this is a very sensitive question .
but you can also think differently about how we see our identity .
the other view is not , does anybody deserve death for a crime , but did we deserve it to kill ?
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
the death penalty in america is defined by error .
on nine people we hired , one that we &apos;ve been executed for is one that we have for innocent , who was released and removed from death .
an amazing error rate . one of nine innocent .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
we would never let anyone fly with an airplane if for nine planes , the cutting off , drop off .
but somehow , we &apos;re creating it from this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden .
it &apos;s not our struggle .
i &apos;m talking a lot about these questions .
i &apos;m talking about race and the question , whether we have the right to kill .
and it &apos;s exciting because i &apos;m going to bring my students to african-american history . i &apos;m talking about slavery .
i &apos;m talking about terrorism , time against the end of the reconstruction , until the beginning of the second world war .
we don &apos;t really know a lot about it .
but for the african-american african-american in this country , it was a time of terror .
in many areas , people were scared of lynchmobs .
or before bombs .
it was fear of terror , which shaped your life .
these older people now come to me and say , &quot; mr , stevenson , you talk , you &apos;re giving talks . you tell people that they should stop saying that we have to stop it for the first time in our nation &apos;s history . &quot;
they say , &quot; no -- tell people that we grew up with it . &quot;
and then , of course , after terrorism , the rasds came out and decades of rassistic motivated and apartheid .
and yet , in our country , there is a dynamic -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
and that &apos;s why we don &apos;t really understand what makes our actions in the historical context .
we repel ourselves .
we &apos;re always creating new tensions and conflicts .
it &apos;s hard to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to approach the truth of truth and reconciliation .
in south africa , people understood that the rasds didn &apos;t get to the truth of truth and reconciliation .
even after the genocide in rwanda , there was these willingness , but not in this country .
i &apos;ve been holding some talks about the death penalty .
it was fascinating because one of the scientists stood up after my talk , and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply disturbing , you talk to me . &quot;
he said , &quot; in germany there &apos;s no death penalty .
and of course , it can never give you to germany . &quot;
it was very quiet . then a woman said , &quot; with our story , it &apos;s impossible that we &apos;re ever killing ourselves for the systematic of people .
it would be fun for us to make sure and target people . &quot;
i thought about it .
what it would feel like is to live in a world where german state has made people , especially when they were a lot of jews .
it would be intolerable .
it would be fun .
and yet , in this country , in the united states of the old south , we &apos;re going to get people -- here &apos;s the risk to be convicted of death .
and yet there &apos;s this mental feedback .
i think our identity is threatened .
if we don &apos;t deal with it , with these difficult issues , the positive and wonderful things are also affected .
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity .
we love entertainment .
but ultimately , these realities will be overstated by suffering , abuse , compairation .
i think it &apos;s important to unite both .
because we ultimately talk about that we need more hope , more engagement , more commitment , in a complex world .
for me , it means time to think and talk about the poor , the dissolved , the damage , the ones that are never going to be at ted .
but thinking about a way that is embedded in our own lives .
we all need to believe the last thing we can &apos;t see .
we do that . so , as rational as we are , we &apos;re seriously estimate of intellect .
innovation , creativity , and development don &apos;t just come from our heads .
they come from ideas that are driven by the beliefs in our hearts .
it &apos;s this headheart connection that i believe is not just to be open to all the bright and exciting things , but for the dark and problematic .
vaclav hahar , the great chean politician , once said .
when we were fighting in eastern europe against the oppression , we wanted to do everything , but what we needed most was hope , to be an intellectual orientation , and witness to be an intellectual orientation , and witness .
this mental orientation is the core of what i think is also the ted community .
there &apos;s no distinction to be technology and design that allows us to be completely human , as long as we don &apos;t have eyes and ears , and the ears and injustice .
i want to warn you . this kind of identity requires a lot more of us than if we don &apos;t care about it .
it &apos;s going to touch them deeply .
as a young lawyer , i offered the great privilege to meet pink parks .
and the woman was coming back to montgomery , where she came back to montgomery , where she had two of her oldest friends traval , the older women , john , who organized the montgomery bus -- and virginia durr , a white , whose husband , clifford durr .
so these women met , and they just stopped .
and then , as a result , the woman called carr , and i said , &quot; bryan , wife parks comes into the city . we want to talk .
do you want to come and listen ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yes , really . &quot;
she said , &quot; and what are you going to do when you &apos;re here ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
and i went over and i just heard .
it was always so inspiring , so that it was so beneficial .
one day i was sitting there , and i heard this women , and after a few hours turned to me , wife parks turned to me , &quot; well bryan , tell me what &apos;s right to the initiative for .
what are they trying to achieve ? &quot;
i started my usual talk .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to avoid injustice .
wr people who were convicted of being innocent .
we want to fight prejudice and discrimination in criminal justice system .
we want to create life survival without specification for children .
we want something against the death company .
we want to reduce the number of crochers .
we want to create mass incarcerations . &quot;
i gave my usual talk , and then she looked at me and she said , &quot; mhmm . mhmm . mhmm . &quot;
she said , &quot; it &apos;s going to make you very , very tired . &quot;
then woman carr to me , put a finger on my face and said , &quot; and therefore , you have to be very , very taw . &quot;
and that &apos;s why i think the ted community should be taw .
we need to make ways to confront the challenges : these problems , this suffering .
because ultimately , our humanity depends on our humanity .
in my work , i learned very simple things .
i learned a couple of very simple things .
that we are all more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
i think that &apos;s true for every person on the planet .
if somebody lies , it &apos;s not just a liar .
if somebody takes something that doesn &apos;t hear him , he &apos;s not just a rebel .
even who kills someone is not just a murcrat .
and because that is , there &apos;s a fundamental human dignity to respect the law .
i also believe that in many parts of this country , and with safety in many parts of the earth , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i don &apos;t think so .
i believe that in many places , the opposite of poverty is justice .
and finally , i think , although it &apos;s so dramatic , so beautiful and inspiring , and so tititive , we &apos;re not going to be measured at the end of our technology , not in the things we develop , not in our intellect and understanding .
finally , a society is not measured by how they do their rich and powerful and privileged , but how they deal with the poor , the arrest .
because in this context , we begin to understand the truly amazing things that make us .
sometimes i &apos;ll lose the balance . a story to end .
sometimes i urge too much .
i &apos;m going to get tired of how we all do .
sometimes these ideas are going ahead of our thinking of thinking , very important and way .
i offer these kids who were convicted of very hard punches .
i go to the study prison , and i go to a client who may be 13 or 14 years old , and who is supposed to be in front of court .
then i ask myself , how could this happen ?
how can a judge turn somebody into something that is not ?
the judge looks at him as adults , but i see a child .
one night i stayed too long and thought my goodness , if a judge can turn us into something else , then he must have magic forces .
right , bryan , the judge has rupowers .
you also want to give them some wishes .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t think of it properly , i began to work on a threshold .
i had a 14-year-old , poor black boys as a lawyer .
and i started to deal with this . the headline was , &quot; any , my arms , 14-year-old black mandates like an privileged , white , 75-year-old top manager . &quot;
in my legacy , i explained that failure of the treasship and the police as well were to consider mistakes .
there was a crazy line about that in this country , that there &apos;s nothing left to do .
the next morning , i woke up , and i didn &apos;t know if i was just dreaming about this crazy thing or actually writing him .
and i had not just written him , but i was sent to the court .
a few months went ahead and i had just forgotten everything .
but finally , i decided , my god , i &apos;ve got to go to the court , and this crazy case .
i got into the car , and i was really overwhelmed -- overwhelmed .
so i went to the court .
and i thought that &apos;s going to be so hard , so painful .
finally , i went out of my car and went up to the court .
when i was going to the court , there was an elderly , black man , the janitors in the court .
when he saw me , he came to me and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
he came to me and hugged me .
he gave me the ear .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
and i have to say , there was power .
it touched something entirely deep in me , identity , the ability to contribute every single one , to a community of hope .
well , i entered the court hall .
when the judge saw me .
he said , &quot; mr. stevenson , did you put that crazy lunch ? &quot;
i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and then we started discussing .
more and more people came in , just because they were angry .
that i had written these crazy things .
police officers came in and propuiled budgets and office employees .
in the handroom , the court was full of people who were angry that we talked about skin languages , about poverty , about inequality .
from my eye , i looked at the janitors and off .
he always saw over the window and could hear the whole tohuwbean .
he went down and down .
finally , this older black man came out with a very strong facial face in the court hall and sat behind me , almost on the bank bank .
10 minutes later , the judge announced a break .
during the pause of the break , a police officer came in , that the janitors was in court .
this deputy ran over to the older black .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do in the courward ? &quot;
the older black man stood up . he looked at the deputy , and he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;ve come to say , &quot; i &apos;ve come up to say that boy , you don &apos;t lose the goal . &quot; don &apos;t give up .
i came to the ted because i think many of you have understood that the moral penduless of the universe is far beyond , but that justice .
we &apos;re not fully developed as humans , as long as we don &apos;t care about human rights and basic values .
that our entire survival is associated with the survival of every single one .
that we need to connect our visions of technology and design , from entertainment and creativity with humanity , pity and justice .
and most of all , i want to leave you with that , just say , just say , don &apos;t lose the goal from the eyes . don &apos;t give up .
you &apos;ve seen this audience , this community , a very apparent wish , and listened to you and to do something .
what else can we do ?
bryan stevenson : well , there are opportunities everywhere .
if you live in california , there &apos;s a national institution in this spring where it &apos;s about taking a lot of effort to do something about the money , which is otherwise in the politics of punishment .
here , in california , for example , you will have a billion dollars in the death row , a billion dollars .
and yet , 46 percent of all potterers don &apos;t deal with a negotiation .
56 percent of all raving cases don &apos;t come before trial .
there &apos;s a chance to do something .
this reference to suggest the money in more security and security .
i think there are opportunities everywhere .
during the last three decades , the crime rate in america is huge .
this fact will often put in a context with elevated rates .
what would you say to someone who believes that ?
well , in fact , the number of nonviolence has not changed very well .
most of the mass extinctions in this country didn &apos;t really find in the class of nonviolence .
it was the misguided cross against drugs .
that &apos;s why the most dramatic figures come to prison .
we set ourselves down from the rhetoric of punishment .
now , we &apos;ve got &quot; three beells &quot; laws that bring people on the board for a bicycle theft , for a bicycle theft , rather than that you &apos;re forcing them to return the victims .
i think we need to do more to help people become the victims of a commodity , not less .
and i think that our current punishment punishment is not helping anyone .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
bryan , you really have a string of string over here .
they &apos;re an inspiring personality .
thank you for being ted . thank you very much .
bin death is an increased risk risk .
famine in somalia . speaker : pepper spray of the police .
you know , malignant cartelle : dangerous cross ships .
social rule . prime speaker : 65 dead .
studio amiwarning : i.9 : cyberattacks
different speakers . weapon of mass destruction . dictator .
recession . arrest . doomsday . egypt .
crisis . death . disaster .
oh my god .
so these are just some of the clips i collected over the last six months -- but it could be the last six days , or the last six years .
in fact , the media may prefer to show us negative topics , because our minds are paying attention to these subjects .
and there &apos;s also a very good reason for that .
every second , our senses will start much more information than our brain can ever process .
and because we &apos;re not more important than our survival , the first stop for all of the information is part of our temporal lobe , the amygdala .
so the amygdala is our early warning system , our risk detector .
it squeezes , and it cuts all the information on the search for every threat of danger in our environment .
so if we see the news , we prefer to look for negative news .
and the old adage saying , &quot; if it &apos;s bleeding , demand is really true .
now , with all our digital devices that are seven days the week , 24 hours a day of all these negative messages , it &apos;s not a miracle that we are pessimistic .
it &apos;s not a miracle that everybody thinks that the world always gets worse .
but possibly that &apos;s not the case .
maybe that &apos;s the reality .
perhaps the enormous progress that we &apos;ve been doing in the last century is made by a series of forces that are so strong that it will be possible in the next three decades to create a world of excess .
now , i &apos;m not saying that we don &apos;t have big problems -- climate crisis , wildlife , water and energy problems -- we &apos;ve already got .
and as humans , we are much better at looking at problems in very long terms , but they eventually get to overcome .
so let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve done in the last century , so we can predict the evolution .
in the last hundred years , average life expectancy has more than doubled to inflation , average income of the world &apos;s population has tripled .
child mortality has been reduced by a tenth .
and that is that the food -- electricity , transportation -- and communication costs , and communication costs have increased around a multiscale .
steve pinker showed us that we &apos;re living in a very peaceful time of human history .
and according to charles kenny , the literacy of literacy is up in the last 130 years from 25 percent to 80 percent .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and many people forget this .
and we continuously increase our expectations .
in fact , we redefined poverty .
think that a large percentage of americans , who live under the poverty line , access to electricity , water , toilets , refrigerators , tv phones and cars .
the richest capitalists of the last century , the empires of the earth , could never have dreamed of these luxury goods .
the foundation for a lot of these technologies , and these are growing expotentially .
my good friend ray kurzweil showed us that every tool that is going to make a difference to information technology on the curve of moore &apos;s law , and the price performance is all 12 to 24 months .
that &apos;s why the mobile phone costs about a million times less and less than a million times faster than a supercomputer in the &apos; 70s .
now look at this curve .
this is the last hundred years law of the last hundred .
notice two things about this curve .
first of all , how smooth do you -- in good times , in bad times , war or peace , recession , depression and high-speed conjuncture .
this is the result of faster computers building faster computers .
it &apos;s slowed down for none of our big problems .
and also , despite her logarithmic loss on the left , she goes upwards .
so the growth rate itself is accelerating .
and on this curve , on the back of moore &apos;s law , we find a series of extraordinary technologies that are available to all .
&quot; cloud computing , &quot; something that my friends at car desk call &quot; calculus computing , &quot; sensors and networks , robots , robots , robots that allow them to democratize the personal production on our planet , synthetic biology , samgenic and artificial intelligence , the digital medicine and the institutional medicine .
how many of you have seen the victory of ibm supercomputer at risk ?
it was a superhero .
i &apos;ve been through the newspapers and looked for the best headlines i could find .
i love this one : &quot; watson enforces human enemies . &quot;
&quot; risk is not a simple game .
it &apos;s about understanding the language of language .
imagine that this artificial intelligence is available to every owner of a mobile phone .
four years ago , ray kurzweil launched , and i &apos;m at ted a new university , called singularity university .
we bring our students all to these technologies with special focus on how these can be used to solve the great challenges of humanity .
and every year we ask the students to create companies , products and services that can live within a decade of the lives of billions of people .
think about the fact that a group of students can influence the lives of billions of people .
30 years ago , this would have been ridiculous .
today we can split on dozens of companies that did exactly this .
if i think to create abundance , i don &apos;t mean a life of luxury for everyone on this planet ; it &apos;s about creating a life full of possibilities .
it &apos;s about making abundance of scarce goods .
so scarcity is in terms of consage , and technology is a resource of resources .
here &apos;s an example .
this is the story of napoleon iiini in the middle of the 18th century .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
he invited the king of siam to dinner .
napoleon soldiers got silver bribe , napoleon himself received gold bribe .
the king of siam , though , got aluminum bribe .
aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet , valuable as gold and plague .
this is why the dome of the sailing &apos;s nightmare was made of aluminum .
although aluminum takes about 8.3 percent of earth &apos;s mass , it doesn &apos;t come from pure metal .
it &apos;s connected by oxygen and illuminates .
but then the technology of the electrolysis developed and made aluminum so cheap that we use it with our way mentality .
then let &apos;s put this analogy into the future .
we think of energy scarcity today .
ladies and gentlemen , we &apos;re living on a planet of 5,000-times more energy than we use a year .
16 terawatts energy prass all 88 minutes on earth &apos;s surface .
it &apos;s not scarcity , the problem is accessible .
and there &apos;s good news .
in this year , you &apos;ve done it for the first time , the cost of solar electricity in india to 50 percent of the tn-stroms -- 8,8 rupees in comparison to 17 rupees .
the cost of solar energy dropped in the last year after 50 percent .
last month , it has been published with a study that shows that until the end of this decade in the united states of the united states of the united states , it &apos;s going to cost about six cents per biologist .
and if we have an energy overshot , we &apos;ll also have water in the abundance .
let &apos;s talk about water wars .
do you remember that when carl sagan is in 1990 , when it moved by saturn , went back to earth ?
he took a famous photograph . how did it mean ?
&quot; a lindbergh blue dot . &quot;
because we live on a water planet .
we live on a planet that &apos;s covered at 70 percent with water .
yes , it &apos;s 97.5 percent saline , two percent , and we fight for 0.5 percent of the water on the planet , but there &apos;s also hope .
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
it &apos;s new nano-gies on the way , nano-materials .
and from a conversation morning with dean kaman , one of the innovators of doing it , i want to share with you -- he gave me the permission -- his technogy , the &quot; slingshot &quot; and &quot; many of you may have heard . it &apos;s the size of a refrigerator . &quot;
it can produce a thousand gallons of clean water every day -- whether water , polluted water , finland -- and all that for less than two cents per liter .
the principal of coca-cola has just invaded , a large project project with a hundred units in developing countries .
and when everything goes well , and i &apos;m very confident , then coca-cola will apply this technology globally in 206 countries around the planet .
this is technology support innovation that is there today .
and we &apos;ve also seen this in mobile phones .
you mean , my goodness , we &apos;re approaching the 70 percent rate of mobile phones in the developing world to the end of 2013 .
just remember that a mai warrior with a cellphone in the middle of kenya has a better mobile phone communication than the president of 25 years ago .
and if you look at your smartphone on google , you have more access to knowing and information as president clinton 15 years ago .
they live in a world that has information and communication in how nobody could ever predict .
and it &apos;s better , the things that you and i have spent several thousand dollars -- gps , hd video and photograph , libraries of books and music -- are now becoming immaterialized and cheaper in your cell phone .
and the best thing about this is perhaps what we expect in health .
in the last month , i had the pleasure , with the quality foundation , which is called &quot; $ 10 million logibility for the x prize . &quot;
we challenge teams all over the world to connect all these technologies together in a mobile phone that you can talk to the device , because it &apos;s with ai equipped , you can test it in huhusts or your blood .
and to win , the device has to be a better diagnosis than a team of highly skilled doctors .
imagine this device . in the middle of a developing country , where there is no doctors , but 25 percent of the disease burden and 1.3 percent of the staff of healthcare .
if this device sequenced a rnache or dna virus that is not known , it &apos;s called the health services , and prevents a pandemic from her outbreak .
but now the biggest force that will lead us to a world of surplus .
i call them the coming billion .
the white lines are for population .
we &apos;ve just crossed the seven-billion-token brand .
and by the way , the biggest decline against a population explosion is a better education and diet in the world .
in 2010 , we had so right under two billion people online .
until 2020 , we &apos;re approaching about two billion internet users .
three billion new heads that we &apos;ve never heard before , the global communication will be present .
what do these people need ?
what are they going to consume ? what will they want ?
and instead of an economy , i see one of the largest economic objections of history .
these people represent multiple trillion dollars that will flow into global economy .
and you &apos;re going to get healthier through the use of the tricoger , and you &apos;re going to be trained by the burning academy , and that &apos;s what you &apos;re going to be able to use , 3d printers and &quot; eureka code , &quot; and so much more productive than ever before .
so what can three billion growing , healthy , educated , productive members of the human community ?
as it would be with a set of new , never before deaf voices .
how about it , the oppressed , wherever you are , is to give a voice to make attention and create change , for the first time ?
what are these three billion people bringing ?
how about beiries that we can &apos;t even predict ?
one of the things that i learned through the x prize is that small teams , that motivate by passion and focus , can create extraordinary things , things that could only create big businesses and governments in the past .
i want to end with a story that really excites me .
there &apos;s a program that some might already know .
it &apos;s a game called foldit .
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
and it &apos;s a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids to study how the protein will evolve .
according to its behavior , we can predict the structure and function .
and this is very important in medical research .
now , this has been a problem for supercomputer .
and this game was taken by university professors , etc .
and it &apos;s now hundreds of thousands of people playing the game online .
and it showed that today the human pattern recognition is better than the best superliers .
and when these people came and looked at who &apos;s the best negative folder in the world , this was not a fan professor , it was not a calchemist student , it was somebody from england , manchester , a woman who was working at the daytime hospital in a rehab hospital , and at night was the best quality of the world .
ladies and gentlemen , what i trust in our future is the fact that today we have more power than individuals to provide the great challenges of our planet .
we have access to tools with exponential technology .
we have the passion of a diy innovators .
we have the capital of techno-philanthroons .
and we have three billion new heads that we can work with online to work the new challenges , and to do what is needed .
we &apos;re expecting some extraordinary decades .
thank you .
i think we need to do something about a transformative value of medical culture .
and i think it starts with a medical doctor , and that &apos;s me .
and maybe i &apos;ve been in business for a long time , that i can give it a piece of my own fake preworth to make this happen .
but before i come to the actual topic of my talk , let &apos;s start with a little bit of baseball .
hey , why not ?
we are the seasonal ones , and we move to the world championship .
we all love baseball , right ?
baseball is full of great statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
&quot; moneyball &quot; seems soon and turns around statistics and to use a great baseball team .
i &apos;m going to relate to a statistic that i hope most of you have heard about .
it &apos;s the average performance of the bat .
we talk about a 300 when a bat is beating 300 .
that means that the player is safe for 10 beats .
that &apos;s called the ball into the outdoor field , and it &apos;s going to get stuck , it &apos;s not caught , and who &apos;s trying to throw the ball to the first base , it didn &apos;t get done in time , and it was in security .
three out of 10 .
do you know how to call a 300ter in grand football baseball ?
well , really good , maybe a real star .
you know how to call a 400ter ?
this is a guy in the rest of the line of four .
legendary -- like ted williams legendary -- the last major ruling baseball players during a regular season over 400 times .
so let &apos;s go back to the world of medicine , in which i feel a lot of good , or maybe a little bit less likely for me to talk to them about it .
suppose you have a blind radio , and you &apos;ll be overcharged to an operateur whose average performance is in terms of blind levels .
it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
imagine life in a certain remote area , and you &apos;ve got a beloved people with clogged heart vessel , and you &apos;ve got your homework overpointing this to a cardiologist whose average performance at the turn of 200 .
but , you know what ?
she &apos;s a lot better this year . she &apos;s on the rising branch .
and she gets an 257 .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
what do you think the average performance for a carrot or a nurse or a nurse or an orthopedic , should be a rescue department ?
1,000 , very good .
the truth is that nobody in the whole medicine knows what a good surgeon or a doctor or rescue assistant should be .
what we do , though , is that every one of them , including being locked into the world , are perfectly perfect .
never make a mistake , but no one &apos;s going to worry about the details of how to do this .
and that &apos;s the message i took in medical school .
i was an elder student student .
in high school , once in high school , he said that brian was going to learn goldman for a bloody test .
and so it was .
and i learned , in my little hole , in the nurses , hisz at the toronto general hospital , unfar from here .
i learned everything .
i learned the origins , and i learned the origins , and every branch of musents , every branch of every one of them , which takes away from the aorta , protective and ordinary differential diagnostics .
i even knew the differential diagnosis to classify renale tucks .
and the whole time i collected more and more knowledge .
and i was good , i graduated with cum laude .
and i left the medical school with the impression that if i knew everything , and all knew , or at least as much as possible , as close as possible , as close as possible , i can make an unfair against the mistakes .
and it worked for a time until i met a printer .
i was resistant to an instructor hospital here in toronto as a woman &apos;s printer in the emergency department of the hospital .
at this point i was pointed out the kardigic layer in kardiological service .
and it was my mission when the emergency staff of banking was looking for the emergency patient .
and feedback to my upper doctor .
i studied my wife , and she was in respiratory distress .
and when i listened to her , she made a bite .
and when i heard her chest with the stethoskopabes , i could hear a broken sound on both sides that told me they suffered under conlical heart failure .
this is a condition where the heart is failing , rather than cleaning the entire blood , and it &apos;s a part of the blood in the lung , and it &apos;s getting these gradually , and that &apos;s where the short-term might come .
and that was not a hard diagnostic .
i hired them and made me care .
i gave her an investment . i gave her her medicine to take the pressure from the heart .
i gave her her medicine that we call diuretics , water pill , so she would release the fluid .
and over a period of two to two hours , they started feeling better .
i felt really good .
and i made my first mistake ; i sent them home .
actually , i made two mistakes .
i sent them home without talking to my inner physician .
i didn &apos;t take the antenna and i did what i would have had a call to my inner doctor , so that he would have had a chance to make his own picture .
and he knew it would have been able to control additional information for her .
maybe i did it with good reason .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the aid doctor .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so able to take responsibility , that i was so worried about my patients without having to contact it .
my second mistake was worse .
so that &apos;s what i would send them home , i had a silent voice in me trying to say , &quot; goldman , no good idea . don &apos;t do that . &quot;
in fact , i &apos;ve been so focused on self-security that i asked the nurse to care about women , &quot; do you think it &apos;s okay if you go home ? &quot;
and the nurse thought about it , and he said , &quot; sure , i think it will go well . &quot;
i remember it was yesterday .
so i underdrew the library of the library and a medical car and rescue rescue and brought them home .
and i went back to work .
the rest of the day , i had this nagging feeling in my stomach .
but i worked on .
and at the end of the day i grabbed my things , the hospital , and went to the parking lot for the car , when i did something that i didn &apos;t do otherwise .
i went home to the emergency department of my way home .
and there was another nurse there , not the sister who had seen for wife , but a different three words to me and fear those three words that i know .
other medical doctors are also afraid , but the emergency medicine is particularly special because we only see the patients that fall .
three words loud : remember it ?
&quot; do you remember the patient that you passed home ? &quot;
asked the nurse .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in this particular note .
so she was back .
she was back and in die .
about an hour after you came home after i sent them home , they collapsed and the family called 911 . the rescue department brought them back to the emergency station of 50 that &apos;s a dangerous shock .
and she &apos;s barely breathing , and she was blue .
the emergency staff took all strands .
they gave her blood pressure .
they put them in the carmch machine .
i was shocked and thrown into the inner .
and i lived through this rolleraster because they went to the active care station , and i hoped they would recover .
and after two , three days , they realized they would never wake up .
she had not suffered a brain damage .
her family gathered up .
and in the course of the next eight or nine days , they gave themselves a shot .
at the new day , they were taking them -- woman printer , a woman , a mother and grandmother .
you say that you will never forget the names of who are dying .
and that was the first time i learned this .
the next couple of weeks , i gave myself confused , and i first found myself the unhealthy shame that exists in our medical culture -- i felt myself alone , not the kind of healthy shame that you can feel because you can &apos;t talk about the colleagues .
you all know the healthy shame , if you give a secret of the best friend prize , even though that one on a disposal , and then you get caught and the best friend , which leads you to never again .
if you do refine and never make the mistakes again .
this is the kind of educational shame .
the unhealthy way that i &apos;m talking about is the one that makes one in the inner ill .
it &apos;s the one that tells you that not what you &apos;re doing is bad , but you &apos;re bad .
and that was what i felt .
and it wasn &apos;t on the bottom of my doctor , he was very gentle .
he was talking to the family , and i &apos;m sure he was the iron glass and sure that i wouldn &apos;t get drunk .
but i applied to these questions .
why didn &apos;t i ask the doctor ? why did i get it home ?
and then in my worst moments , how could i make such a stupid mistake ?
why did i go to medicine ?
but slowly , it certainly took it .
i started feeling better .
and then on a clouded day , there was a hole in the clouds and the sun broke out , and i might be able to feel better again .
and i was talking to me that if i doubled my efforts to the perfection , and never made a mistake , that the voice could miss .
and she did .
and i worked on .
and then it happened again .
two years later , i had service in the emergency hospital in an communist hospital north of toronto , and i had a 25 year-old man with arrested raves .
it was much less , and i &apos;m in a hurry .
he always showed up here .
i looked at the raps and it was a little bit of pink .
and i gave him a competition for penicillin and sent him forward .
and when he went out of the door , he showed up his raps .
two days later , i came to my new emergency service , and my chedytin asked me to talk to her in her office .
and she said the three words : remember you ?
&quot; do you remember the patient with the cloned raps ? &quot;
it turns out he was a dig infection .
he had an potentially dangerous illness called gunglottis .
you can google , but it &apos;s not an infection of the wheel , but it &apos;s the top breathing way , and it causes the amount of respiratory lanes .
and fortunately , he didn &apos;t die .
he got intravenous anti-botica and ordered a few days later .
and i went back through the same torlight of shame and self-doubt , felt free and went to work until it came back and again and again .
in an emergency layer , i &apos;ve looked at two times a blind mentor .
there &apos;s a lot of that , especially when you think that you &apos;re working in a hospital that had only 14 patients per night .
in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home , and there was no man in their treatment .
at one point , i thought he had kidney stones .
i highlight the prescription of the kidney . when this was without the case of the patient , my colleague in the back of the patient would find a contract in the lower right sector and called the opergery .
the other one had strong diarrhea .
i sat at it to reress him and asked my colleagues to judge him .
and that &apos;s what he did , and when he captured an inert in the right sector , he called the opera .
in both cases , operized and it was fine .
both cases made me ask questions .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst mistake happened only in the first five years , what many of my colleagues claim , but it &apos;s common nonsense .
some of my favorites happened in the last five years .
alone , shame and no support .
so here &apos;s the problem : if i don &apos;t end with my mistakes and talk about them , if i can do the silent voice that tells me what really wasn &apos;t going to happen to my colleagues ?
how can i teach them my mistakes so that they don &apos;t make the same commit ?
if i was in a room -- like now , i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re thinking about .
when did you hear the last time of someone from misbeat about failures ?
oh yes , you go to a cocktail party and you might hear about any other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody talking about your own mistakes .
if i was in a room full of colleagues who would ask for their immediate support , and to tell them what i was telling you , i would not be able to reach the end of the second story before it really fails to give you a joke , and the rest of it was going to go to the rest .
and in fact , if i or my colleagues knew that an orthopedide in my hospital would have taken the wrong leg , you think i would have trouble looking at it in the eyes .
that &apos;s the system we live in .
it &apos;s a totally denial of mistakes .
it &apos;s a system where there are two basic positions -- those who make mistakes , and those who don &apos;t do . those who are disqualified , the ones who are disstanding with bad outcomes and with good results .
it &apos;s almost an ideological response like antibodies that are attacking people .
and there &apos;s the idea that when we get those who make mistakes out of medicine , we have a secure system .
but there are two problems .
in my about 20 years of the medical system , and journalism , i &apos;ve created a personal medical study about health errors and wrong treatments to make everything i think of as a first article for the toronto star i &apos;m doing for the toronto star .
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely unlocked .
we &apos;re working in a system where every day in which one of 10 media channels are either a false or false job , where hospital infections are always going to grow and grow , or dead , or dead .
in this state , about 24,000 canadians die in complete mistakes .
in the united states , the institute of medicine targeted the number of 100,000 .
both of these are strong subcapitations , because we don &apos;t think of the problem as we should .
and it &apos;s the crux .
in a hospital system where medical knowledge doubled all two to three years , we can &apos;t keep up .
sleep is ubiquitous .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we have an cognitive error , so we can take a perfect disease for a patient with chest pain .
then i take the same patient with chest pain , take it down and give it a little bit of alcohol breath , and then the story is a little bit of alcohol .
i don &apos;t take the same thing .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things .
and my patients are not cars ; they don &apos;t always tell me their symptoms in the same way .
all of these are mistakes .
so if you take the system , as i &apos;ve been taught , and all of the faulty health experiments , then no one &apos;s left .
and you know the glue of people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
in my show , white sandy , black art , i have the habit of saying , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; i would say to each of the rescue of the city department to the chefarologists , &quot; this is my worst mistake , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah . &quot;
and then their puils expand , they come down before the head , and they look down and hard , and they start telling their stories .
they want to tell their stories . they want their stories to share .
they want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistakes that i made . &quot;
what they need is an environment that they need to make .
what you need is a new medical culture .
and it starts with a doctor .
the new doctor &apos;s new doctor is a human , knows about its humanity , accepted , is not proud of making mistakes , but it &apos;s all about learning that it can be passed away .
they share their experiences with others .
they supported when others are talking about their mistakes .
and it shows others their mistakes , not in perfect , but in a loving , supportive way that everybody will benefit .
and it works in a medical culture that recognizes that people are filling the system with life and when that is , people do mistakes from time to time .
so that the system evolved to create backups , which will make it easier to find mistakes that make people inevitable , and make it as loving , to create more supportive spaces where anyone who &apos;s watching the health error , in fact , the things that are going to be able to look at the health error , which is actually what the potential error is going to look like , in fact , is things like that .
my name is brian goldman .
i &apos;m the new doctor .
i &apos;m a human . i &apos;m making mistakes .
i &apos;ll sit . but i &apos;m trying to learn a best way to learn it from other people .
i don &apos;t know what they &apos;re holding from me , but i can live with it .
let me close with three of my words : i remember .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny little idea .
it &apos;s about shifting aluminum values .
and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i &apos;ll tell you three stories earlier to use the time .
the first story is charles darwin , one of my heroes .
you know , he was in 1835 .
you might think that he was frocking , but that &apos;s not true .
actually , he collected fish .
he described one of these as &quot; common &quot; .
it was a groudy .
until in the &apos; 80s , it was used in great style .
now he &apos;s in the red list of dangerous species .
we &apos;ve heard this story many times from the galapagos islands or other places , it &apos;s not very special .
yet , we &apos;re still on the galapagos islands .
we still think they &apos;re originally .
the brostle are still describing them as untouched .
what &apos;s happened here ?
the second story is to make a different concept of shifting taillar .
because i experienced it when i studied a lagoie in west africa .
i went there because i grew up in europe and wanted to work later in africa .
i thought i could integrate .
and i got a terrible sunfire and i was convinced i wasn &apos;t from there .
it was my first sunfire .
as you can see , the sponences of palms and a few mangroves were surrounded by a few mangroves .
there was a number of about 20 inches of swim , schwarzkots , a kind of bunchless .
the fishes of these bunts were very lonely , and the fishermen lived well on it , and it was overaverage in ghana .
when i returned to 27 years later , the fish went down to half his size .
they grow five centimeters .
they were genetically led .
it was still fish .
people still were happy .
and the fish also had the happiness to be there .
so nothing changed , and yet everything changed .
my third little story tells me about my husband &apos;s introduction of aviation in southeast asia .
in the &apos; 70s -- in the beginning of the 1960s , europe has a lot of development projects .
fishing systems , countries that have already started 100 fish , called the industrial fish of this fairly ugly ship .
i went to it , and we set up on the entire southern south chinese sea and especially in the javasee .
we didn &apos;t have words for what we started .
i know the reason it was the ocean .
90 percent of our fangs were weaks , other animals who are connected to the reason .
the biggest part of the fish , the small dots there on the rubble , were a coral reef fish .
essentially , the reason the ocean was on the deck and then was thrown back .
these images are extraordinary , because the transition is very quick .
within a year , you get a census , and then starts with the commercial fish catch .
the reason is going to change . from -- in this case -- it &apos;s a hard reason or a soft coral .
this is a dead turtle turtle .
they weren &apos;t eaten , you threw them away because they were dead .
we started a vibrant .
she wasn &apos;t drunk .
then they wanted to kill them , because they could eat them well .
in fact , this mountain of race is collected every time you drive into areas where you &apos;ve never been served .
it &apos;s not going to document .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
we adapt our crops to the new level , and we don &apos;t recall what was there .
if you generalize it , this is happening .
on the y-axis , there are some good things : biodiversity , number of orca , the green of their country , the water supply .
over time , it changes . it changes because for the people , they are of course .
every generation looks at the images you &apos;re looking at at the beginning of your profession , as standard and becomes all of it .
the difference then is being seen as loss .
but they don &apos;t answer the previous losses .
it can give you order of changes .
and at the end , they just want to get the secondary remains .
right now , that &apos;s what we do .
we want to get things that are disappeared or things that are not like that anymore .
you could now think that the problem with people who certainly lived when they lived in predators were killing animals , killing animals only after a few generations , which they had done .
because obviously an animal is going to have a very common animal , only before it dies .
so you don &apos;t often lose animals .
you lose rare animals .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not being seen as big loss .
over time , we &apos;re focusing on the big animals , and the ocean is the big fish .
you &apos;ll get rare because we &apos;re catching it .
it &apos;s a little fish left , and we think that &apos;s the processor .
the question is , why people accept this .
well , because they don &apos;t know it was different .
of course , many people , scientists , confirm that it was really different .
they will confirm it because the evidence of how they were in a previous form , they &apos;re not like the evidence they would like to do .
so , for example , there &apos;s the anecdote that the report of a capitity of capital looked like this in this area of big fish , not being used , or typically , from fishing scientists , because it &apos;s not the scientific .
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in educated societies , because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
this shows the enormously big role of a marine reserve .
because marine protected areas are basically the past .
we come back to the past that people can &apos;t understand because the ultraviolet values have changed and very low .
so the people who see a marine marine reserve and benefit from the way that they allow us to bring their crops back .
what about the people who are not possible , because they don &apos;t have access -- people in the middle west for example ?
here , i think , the art and the film may fill the gap , and simulation .
this is the simulation of chesapeake bay .
a long time ago , there was gray whales -- 500 years ago .
and the color notes , you may remember , &quot; avatar . &quot;
if you think about avatar , if you think about why people are so touched by this -- except from the pocahonum story , why were they touched by the imagery world ?
because it &apos;s a little bit of singing that &apos;s lost in a way .
so my recommendation , the only one i &apos;m going to give you , is about cameron , so he &apos;s called &quot; avatar ii . &quot;
thank you .
in the &apos; 80s , in the communist east germany , you had to , if you had a typewriter , that you had to register the government .
they also had to register a sheet with an unprecedented text .
the reason for this : the government could follow back where a text came from .
they found an article with false thought , they could discover the creator of this thought .
and we couldn &apos;t understand how anyone could do something like that , and how much the freedom would affect .
in our own countries , we would never do that .
but if you &apos;re going to buy a new color laser in 2011 , you &apos;re buying a new laser printer from the leading laser press , and print a page , then this page is bright yellow at every page , in a pattern that makes the site clear .
this is what happens today .
and there seems to be no rain about that .
and that was an example of what our own governments the technology , the citizens , are utilizing .
and this is one of the three major sources of existing online problems today .
let &apos;s look at what really happens in the world : we can split the attacks in categories .
we have three main groups .
there are online criminals .
for example , this is mr. tortured goluong from gw in ukraine in ukraine .
and the logic of online criminals are very easy to understand .
these guys deserve money .
they use online attacks to make a lot of money , a huge pile of money .
there are several known cases of online amounts of online , multicounting , which made your money through attacks .
this is wladii tsastsin from stetu in estonia .
this is alfred gonzbellz .
stephen watts .
bjnik sundin .
this is matthew anderson , tariq al-dar and so on and so forth .
these people have come online , but they have acquired it illegal by using trojans to crack money out of our bank , while we &apos;ve done our online banking , or keylogans that have collected our credit card information , or keylogger , which we have our credit card online .
the u.s. intelligence agency , two months ago , the swiss account of mr. sam jain here , and on this account , were 14.9 million dollars , when it was frozen .
mr. jain himself is on free-feet , who is unknown .
and i want to argue that today it &apos;s more likely that we &apos;re going to be victims of a online , when one in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this will be even worse .
in the future , most crimes will play online .
the second largest ferner we see today are not motivated by money .
they &apos;re motivated by something else -- protests , one opinion , or their audience .
groups like anonymous are up over the last 12 months , and they become one of the main players on the field of online attacks .
so these are the three main funders : criminals , the money that &apos;s doing it because of the money , hackers like anonymous , which are causing resistance , but the last group are nations , governments that govern attacks .
there we are cases , like the diginotar .
it shows unprecedented what happens when governments attack their own citizens .
diginotar is a complete lexicon of the netherlands -- or it was .
in the last fall , it had to pick up , because diginotar had been hacked .
somebody was attracted to the system , and he was very sensitive to the system .
and last week in a meeting with dutch government agency , i asked one of the senior people who asked the question to be able to make it possible because of the diginotar hacks .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
now , how are people dying of such hacks ?
diginotar is a certificate .
they sell certificate .
what do you do with board ?
now , a certificate requires you , if you have a website with http , with ssl encryptes , for example .
now , we all use , or many of us , gmail or one of their competitors , but these services are particularly common in totalitarian states like iran , where dissidents can use the more trust , and that they know that they &apos;re going to be able to be able to make more trust as local personnel , and they know that they &apos;re going to be able to be able to make more trust as local providers .
but if you go into a foreign
certificate , hacking and fake certificate .
and that &apos;s what diginotar is happening .
how about the arab spring and the things that are happening in egypt ?
now , in egypt , they ploted the insurgency in april of 2011 , the headquarters of the egyptian intelligence police , and they found a lot of records .
in those records , a folder called &quot; finfinder . &quot;
and in this folder , some of the notes in germany had sold a bunch of programs that the egyptian government had sold some programs that they -- in very large frame , could catch any communication of egyptian citizen .
they had sold this program for 280,000 euros to egyptian government .
the corporate headquarters is right here .
so western governments are providing totalitarian governments to help their own citizens .
but western governments also help themselves .
for example , in germany just a few weeks ago of the so-called state of state , it was a trojer who was used by german government supplies to bend their own citizens .
if you put it in a crime case , it &apos;s going to be pretty security with your phone .
but today we are far beyond that .
they tap their internet connection .
they use resources like the state of the state to check their computer with a trojer , which allows them to monitor their entire communication , to listen to their online discussions , their spare words .
so if we think about these things , the obvious answer to people would be , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it &apos;s not because i &apos;m a brown citizen .
i don &apos;t have to worry !
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
and that argument doesn &apos;t make sense .
privacy has to be given .
privacy is not a debate .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and safety .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
and as we do today , in the year 2011 , our governments like to trust , is every right thing we &apos;re going to do forever .
and we trust , we trust the trust of any future government , a government we may have in 50 years ?
these are the questions that we have to deal with the next 50 years .
it may seem strange to you , but i &apos;m a big fan of concrete blocks .
the first concrete blocks were made in 1868 , and one of the simple ideas of a simple idea : stack from zlicance , which fit together .
concrete building blocks were very quickly taken in the world .
they put us in the position of building things that were bigger than we , buildings , bridges , a rock after the other .
essentially , the concrete building was turned into our time .
almost a hundred years later , in 1947 , lego came out of this .
it was called &quot; automatically compunding rock . &quot;
and within a few years , lego moved in every household .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion rocks were produced -- or 75 stones for every person on this planet .
you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to create beautiful houses , beautiful bridges or beautiful buildings .
lego made it possible for everyone .
lego has essentially the concrete building block , the building of the world , and made it a block for our imagination .
meanwhile , in the same year &apos;s bell labs , the next revolution announced the next revolution .
the transistor was a little plastic unit that was made us from a world of static , mixed tiles to a world in which everything was interactive .
as the concrete block , the transistor allows us to build much greater , more complex flows , a brick after the other .
but there is a major difference : the transistor was just for experts .
i personally accept that that the building of our time is for experts , and so i decided to change that .
eight years ago , i was at the media lab , and i began to explore this idea of how to do the power of engineers in the hand of artists and designers .
a few years ago , i started developing littalive .
let me show you how they work .
littalive is electronic modules that have a specific function .
they &apos;re justified , light , clay , motor and sensor .
and the best thing is that they connect with magnets .
so you can &apos;t put it wrong .
the stones are colorated .
green is a copy , blue is power , pink is input and orange is wires .
so all you need to do is , you know , a blue and a green one , and you can build it very quickly .
they put a blue on a green , and they can make light .
you can put a switch in between and have a little dimmer .
take the switch out around a pulky , which is here , and they &apos;ve made a little blind .
add this buzzese to the extra effect , and they have made noise machine .
i &apos;ll stop that .
beyond the simple game , littlive is actually quite powerful .
rather than , you know , you have to code , flop or lion , allows you to program littalive with simple , intuitive gestures .
so to accelerate the blind or slow , just rotate on this button , and it makes the impulse faster or slower .
the idea behind littlife is that it &apos;s a growing library .
we want to bring every single interaction on this world in an autonomous fashion .
lights , sound , solar elements , motors -- everything should be available .
we &apos;ve spread littalive to children and see them playing .
and it was an incredible experience .
the most beautiful thing is how you start to understand the electronics that you &apos;re developing in the everyday world and not learning in school .
like , for example , a night light works , or why the doors of how to stay open , or how a ipod responds to touch .
we &apos;ve also brought littalive to design schools .
so , for example , we had designers with no experience in electronic things that started playing with littlives as a material .
here we see with filz , paper and bottles , like georthe ...
a few weeks ago , we brought littalive to risd and gave them some designers who had no technical experience -- just box , wood and paper -- and they said , &quot; what . &quot;
so here &apos;s an example of a project that they did , a movdriven contrizer cannon .
but wait , this is really my favorite project .
it &apos;s a hummer from dough , the fear in the darkness .
for those non-engineers , littalive is another material , electronics just became another material .
and we want to make this stuff available for everyone .
so littalive is open source .
you can go to the website , all the design objections , and they make themselves .
we want to make the world of creating the inventor , the inventor , because that world , in which we live , these interactive world , belongs to us .
so , pull out and start to invent .
thank you .
