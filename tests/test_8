you know , one of the great favorites of travel and one of the pleasure in the race research is to live with the people who can remember the old days , and their past still feels in the wind , and they touch it in the rain .
just knowing that jaguar shaman still travel beyond the milky ator or the meaning of the myth of the oldest of the oldest is still significant , or that in the himalayas , the buddhist revelation of anthropology is going to take the breath of the dharma , which is the idea that we don &apos;t exist in an absolute sense of anthropology , but only as a model of reality as a consequence of a group of possibilities of our ancestors , in the same generations .
and of course , we share all the same adaties .
we &apos;re all born . we get kids to the world .
we run through rituals .
we have to deal with the indiscriminative separation of death , and so it shouldn &apos;t surprise us that we all sing , dance and art .
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique metric of storytelling , the rhythm of dance in every culture .
it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s about the commuting in the forests of borneo , or the voodoo acolyths in haiti , or the warrior in the c-ud desert of north kenya , the curate in the rift desert , or a caraseria in the middle of the sahara , or , in fact , in the middle of the qomolma , everest i traveled to the desert .
all these people teach us that there are other actors , other ways of thinking , other ways of guidance on earth .
and this is an idea that , when you think about it , can only fulfill a hope .
together , the dutch species of the world are forming a network of spiritually and cultural life , which is the earth , and for the most part , the earth is equally important , like biological life , which you know as a biosphere .
you can think of this cultural grid as an ethnosphere of life as the overall sum of all thoughts and dreams , myths , ideas , discoveries and intuitive ones that have been created for the beginnings of consciousness .
the ethnic sphere is the great legacy of humanity .
it &apos;s the symbol of all of what we are and what we know as astonishing species of science .
and just as the biosphere has been very strong , this happened with the ethnosphere -- just with greater speed .
for example , no biologist would say that 50 percent or more of all species are in front of extinction , because it &apos;s simply not true , and yet , this -- the apocalyptic scenario on the field of biological diversity -- is almost hardly the most optimistic scenario on the area of cultural diversity .
and the key indicator for this is extinction .
when each one of them was born in this room , there were 6,000 languages talking on earth .
now , a language is not only the equivalent of the vocabulary or a series of grammatic output .
a language is expression of the human mind .
it &apos;s a means to find the soul of a specific culture access to the tangible world .
every language is like an ancient forest of the mind , a turning point , an ecosystem spiritual opportunity .
and from those 4,000 languages , we &apos;re going to be sitting here in monterey as we &apos;re sitting here in monterey , right half the children .
they &apos;re not taught little kids . that means that if nothing is done , they &apos;re actually dead already .
what could be more lonely than being shocked by the silence , to be one of the last of your people who speak your language , no possibility to have the wisdom of the ancestors , or hope children ?
and yet , in fact , this horrible destiny is actually someone in the world somewhere on earth , about every two weeks , because all of the two weeks , a older man dies and takes the last sylles of an old language to the grave .
and i know that some of you say , &quot; is it not better ? &quot; the world wouldn &apos;t be a better place when we &apos;re all talking about a language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s be that language yoruba . &quot;
let &apos;s be cogi . &quot;
and then they would suddenly recognize how it would be if they couldn &apos;t talk to their own language .
so i would like to take you in a way today through the race sphere , a short journey through the race sphere to try to figure out what &apos;s actually lost .
now there are some of us who actually forget that if i say , &quot; different possibilities of his being , &quot; really different possibilities of his .
so , for example , take this kid of the barasana in the northwest of the amazon , the people of the islamic conda , believe that they &apos;d come up with a mythologically river river from the east of sacred snakes .
this is a people who don &apos;t realize cognitively between color and green , because the skies of the forest that people depend on is equal to .
you have a sense of language and a heiger writing that &apos;s called linguistic exotic , you have to marry someone who talks a different language .
all of this in the back of the mythological past , and the other of these big houses , where because of the mischew six or seven languages , are talked about , though , that you never hear somebody who learns a language .
you just listen to and start talking .
or , one of the most fascinating tribes that i &apos;ve ever lived with , the waorani in the northeast of ecuador , was an amazing people in 1958 .
in 1957 , five missionaries tried to contact and did a heavy mistake .
they threw mixed photos out of the air , which we would consider as a friendly gesture , and then they forgot that these people had never seen anything in the rainforest in their lives .
they took these photographs from the forest floor , they tried to see the face or the character , didn &apos;t find anything and aspirations that this is business cards of the devil and killed the five missional with the spears .
but the waoti didn &apos;t grow just outside of the spears .
they went through each other .
54 percent of deaths happened through power .
we went back to the genetiaology eight generations , and we found two cases of a natural death , and when we asked people to do something about it , they gave them that one of the people who had died was because of his age , and we killed it with the spears .
but at the same time they had a very clear knowledge of forests , which was amazing .
their predators could smell the urine of an animal from 40 steps away and determine what animal species of this owned .
in the early &apos; 70s , i got a really amazing task , when my professor asked me if i was interested in walking to haiti and to colonize the secret societies that were the strength of duvalier and tonton macousin , and that was the poison that was used to make zombies .
in order to give this great sense , i had to know something about this remarkable belief of vodoun , and voodoo is not a cult of the black magic .
in the contrary , it &apos;s a complex metaphysical view .
it &apos;s interesting .
if i asked them to count the great world leaders , what would they say ?
christianity , islam , buddhism , rabbits or whatever .
a continent will always be thrown out , because the guess was that in sub-saharan africa , there was no religious belief , of course , there was one and voodoo simply is this very profound religious thought that came over during the poet &apos;s season .
but what voodoo so interesting is that these live relationships between the living and the dead .
the living bias .
the ghoolyth can be swallowed by the large water , answers to the rhythm of the dance to integrate the soul of the living , so that the acolyth for a brief moment is going to be the god .
you &apos;d like to say the voodooartist , &quot; you white walks into the church and you talk about god .
we dance in the temple and become god . &quot;
and because you &apos;re obsessed with , are you going to take off the mind , how can you get damage ?
look at these amazing demonstrations : voodoo-akolyths in a transcestate , the fireend coal without bueling charcoal , an amazing illustration of the spirit of the mind to influence the body that it &apos;s holding out in a state of extreme arousal .
well , from all the people i &apos;ve met were the kogi from the sierra camps in northern columbia , the most extraordinary .
offspring , the old tyrannical civilization , the carbian coastal level of colombia , and in the series of the organization , it took this people back into an isolated volcano , which goes back on the cargue coast .
in a blood bar , these people were the only ones who have never conquered from the spaniards .
until the day , you &apos;re going to be governed by a ritual priesting , and education is very extraordinary to the priests .
the young acolyths are separated in the age of three and four years of their families , and in a warm world of the finpice , in stone hates of the glacier for 18 years . two periods of a nine years , they &apos;re dedicated to to mimic the nine months of pregnancy that they spent on their own mother &apos;s lap .
and during this whole time , they &apos;re being introduced to the values of their society , values that sustain the claim that their prayers and only their prayers , the cosmic -- or we could say the ecological -- balance .
at the end of this amazing initiation , all of a sudden you &apos;re going to look out , and for the first time in your life , at age 18 , you see a sunland , and in this crystal moment of the first light of consciousness , when the sun starts to starbucks the curtains of the amazing beautiful landscape , suddenly everything you &apos;ve learned in the abstract , and the priest goes back and says , &quot; look ? it &apos;s really like i told you . &quot;
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
they call the older brothers and say that we are the younger brothers , for the destruction of the world .
now this level of intuition becomes very important .
every time we think about it and we think of the landscape , we can either look at rousseau and the old smell of the nost-wild , which is a continuous thought , or on the other hand , and say , these people are more connected to nature than we do .
so , being born are neither sentimental , you &apos;re not going to get off the nostalgia .
it doesn &apos;t have a lot of space for the malaria in south cancer , and the cold winds of tibet , but they still have a mysterious nimbus of the earth , which is not based on the idea of being aware , but on a very subtle intuition , the idea that the earth can only be put in the human consciousness .
now , what does that mean ?
it means that a small child is growing out of the sacred , that the mountain is an apua mind , which is his or her destiny , become a completely different person , and a different relationship with this resource , and a different relationship to this resource , and this place , as a small child in montana , is that a mountain can become a bunch of rocks .
whether he &apos;s staying in a spirit of a mind or a bunch of tiats is meaningless .
the interesting thing is the metaphor that defined the relationship between the individual and the nature of nature .
i grew up in the forests of british columbia , and i believed that these forests are going to be there .
this made me a different human being as my friends under the kwakitl , believing that these forests of staying in the place of hukuk and the cannial spirits are , which are living on the north of the world , ghosts , which they would participate in in their romatsao .
now , if you start looking at the idea that these cultures can create different realities , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries , such as this plant .
it &apos;s a photograph that i just took last april in the north of the amazon .
this is ayahuca , from the many of you heard , the most powerful psycho-active pre-active deparat of the shaman .
what ayahuca makes so fascinating is not just the pharmaceutical potential of this preparance , but its processing . it &apos;s made out of two different sources . on the one hand , there are these wooden lies that have a series of betains , harclin , harmolin , harmolin , harclin , and this climbing plant alone , it &apos;s going to be about a smoke of coffee on their consciousness , but it becomes about the petals of the family .
this plant contains some very strong tryptamine to the serotonin , dimethane tryptamain-five and dedicated xydimethane trypism , very similar .
if you &apos;ve seen the yfo momi , as you have this stuff , this substance that contains you from different kinds of things , it has dedicated xydiki trypism .
this powder is about becoming about as much as a barrel of a barrel of mine , and it &apos;s grown from baroarole paintings , and the landing on a sea of electricity .
it &apos;s not going to create a distortion of reality , but the resolution of reality .
i even have with my professor , richard evan shultes , the man who led the psychedelic to the discovery of the magic mushrooms in mexico in the 30 years , talks about this . i argued that you couldn &apos;t be able to experience a hallucination .
but the thing about tryptamins is that they can &apos;t be chared , because they &apos;re in a human gut , of course , with the name of the enzyme monoamin-oxiase .
you can only be taken in connect with some other chemicals that the mao denyprier .
now the intriguing thing is that the drone is in the lies , which are in the lies , mao-rabbits of exactly the kind of stuff that is necessary to power the tryptamine . so ask yourself .
how can these people not find out of a flora from 80,000 species of adstrate plants that are not related to these two morphologically related plants that , if they put together , create a kind of biochemical version that is so much larger than the sum of its parts ?
we use this great euphemism , trying and error , which turns out to be meaningless .
but you ask the indians , &quot; the plant is talking to us . &quot;
so , what does that mean ?
so this tribe , the cofan , have 17 varieties of ayahuca , which you all recognize at large distance in the forest , that appear for our eyes as a form .
and then you ask them , for example , how they inject their taxonomy and they say , &quot; i thought you understand something about plants .
i mean , you don &apos;t know anything ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
so , it turns out you take every one of the 17 varieties of full moon and you sing them into a different position .
now , this doesn &apos;t bring you a ph.d. at harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than a tribe .
now , the problem of problem-solving is that even those of us who have symbols for the difficult situation , they &apos;re looking at as orginidal and colorful , but they kind of look at the past as the real world , which is our world , progress .
so , the fact is that you remember the 20th century , 300 years for its wars or technical innovation , but rather as an era where we were against , and the massive destruction of the biological and cultural diversity on earth are either active or passive . so the problem isn &apos;t the change .
all cultures have been involved in the dance with new possibilities .
and the problem is not the technology .
the hirshhorn indian didn &apos;t stop to be less on the sioux than they had bow and arrow , when americans stopped being americans , when they stopped the horse and horse cars .
not change and technology threatening the integrity of race , it &apos;s power . the ugly face of rule .
and wherever you can see around the world , you will discover that these cultures are not the set of people . these are dynamic living peoples , whose existence is driven by cognitive forces , and whether it &apos;s about their capacity to be humiliated by the world &apos;s capacity , or in the case of ybeck , where it has been disease , which has been humiliated during the gold logging .
or if we go to the mountains of tibet , where i do a lot of work , you will see ugly face of political dominance .
you know , the genocide , the phymetic extinction of people will generally be convicted , but the ethnidal , the destruction of the lives of life , will not only be convicted , but generally , as part of a design strategy .
and you can &apos;t understand that if you haven &apos;t experienced it on the bottom level .
i used to go with a young colleague of 7,000 miles of chstudu in western china through southeast tibet , and only when i came to lhasa , and i saw the face behind the statistics of the statistics that turned out to be killed , 1.2 million people who were killed during the cultural revolution of the ice revolution .
the father of this young man was identified as a fan of the pane lama .
that meant he was killed during the chinese invasion .
his uncle buh with her holiness in the diaspora who brought people to nepal .
his mother became inlocked as punishment for -- for the crime to be wealthy .
he was beaten up at the age of two in the prison for two years to hide under her rockballs , because she couldn &apos;t live without him .
the sister , who did this tasty , was brought into an educational camp .
and one day she came out of a wriber band of maos and for this reception she had to be a heavy job for seven years .
the suffering can be intolerable , but the psychzing spirit of people is something unforable .
and at the end , we &apos;re really facing a choice . do we want to live in a monochromatic world of monotonia or in a polychromatic world ?
margaret mead , the great anthropologist said before she died that her greatest fear is that while we go towards a thread , we can &apos;t just move away the entire range of the human imagination , we would not only see the whole range of the human imagination on a thought , but we &apos;ve got to wake up one day .
and it &apos;s humbling to think that our species may have existed for 600,000 years .
the neolithic revolution , which brought us agriculture , and in this moment , the cult of the seeds threw the poetry of the torman through the priah of the priests and the hierarchy , specialization , specialization -- just 10,000 years ago .
the modern industrial world as we know it is hardly 300 years old .
well , this shallow story doesn &apos;t tell me that we all have answers to the challenges that we are in the tens of thousands of years .
if we were to think of these circular world cultures after the meaning of human being , answers to 10,000 different voices .
and in this song , we &apos;re going to rediscover the possibility to be what we are : human beings , who are aware of the importance , that all people and gardens have to flourish a space . and there &apos;s great moments of optimism .
here &apos;s a picture i took at the northern end of the baffel islands when i went to the narspits hunt , and this man , olef , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
the eastern government is not always very good with the inuit , and during the 50d years of our host , they were forced to pull in settlements .
the grandfather of this old man refused .
the family , the fear of his life , took him all the weapons and all the tools .
now you have to know that the inuit is not afraid of the cold . they used them to their advantage .
the rail tracks were originally made out of fish , which was made in carspa skin .
the man &apos;s grandfather didn &apos;t fear himself before the arctic night or the launch of storm .
he hatched out to the outside , left his pants from mountains of mountains , and decured in his hand , and when the feces started frocking them , he shaped them into the form of a glacier .
he injected to the sides of the heel , and when it was completely frozen , he would take a dog with it .
he represented the dog , and he made a shoppy , took the elephant of the dog and improvised a slip , and he had another dog , and she would talk about the ice cream on the brakes on the brakes .
so you can &apos;t do anything that way .
and this is a symbol in many ways for the resistance of the inuit and all of the infants around the world .
the canadian government gave the inuit in april in 1999 , the complete control of an area that is bigger than california and texas combined .
it &apos;s our new housing , and it &apos;s called avey .
it &apos;s an independent area . they control all the mammals .
an amazing example of how a nation , a state that can take care of its citizens and can reach .
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who &apos;ve traveled to these distant goals of the earth , that they &apos;re not at all .
they are the countries of somebody .
they represent parts of the human imagination that goes back in recent times , and for all of us , the dreams of these children , the dreams of our own children , are the dreams of the geography of hope .
what we &apos;re trying to do at national geographic is we believe that politicians never do anything .
we believe that polemics -- we believe that polemics is not compelling , but we believe that storytelling can change the world and we &apos;re probably the best institution for storytelling in the world . our website gets 35 million every month .
156 nations send our tv channel .
our magazines are read by millions .
and we have a series of trips to the ethnosphere where we take our audiences into places like this , and hopefully , you know , they take one after the rest of the anthropology , and hopefully they will take the central revelation of anthropology : that the world has earned it in a really multi-cultural pluralist world where wisdom can contribute to our shared well-being .
thank you .
what i first want to leave you with first , as fast as possible , is the basic work , a new technology that we call microsoft as part of a year ago , ostened . this is seadraine . and it &apos;s an environment where they can either deal with super-large amounts of visual data .
we see a lot of , many gigabytes of digital photographs here , who are going to bring selos and continuously , rearrange , in any way .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how many information we look at , how big these collections are , or how big the images are .
most of them are digital photographs of a camera , but this one is a scan of congress and it &apos;s in a field of 300 meres .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference , because the only thing that the performance of a system can compute like this is the number of pixels on your screen in every moment . it also has a very flexible architecture .
this is a whole book , an example of non-visual data .
this is bleak house of dickens . every span is an chapter .
to prove that it &apos;s really about a text and not a picture , we can do something like that to really show that this one is a real representation of the scene and not a picture .
maybe this is an artificial way to read a book .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
this is a realistic case . this is a copy of the guardian .
every big picture is the beginning of a piece .
and that gives you really the pleasure and the good experience of reading a real paper , or a newspaper , or a newspaper , which is a sort of medium with multiple scales .
we also made something on the corner of this particular issue of the guardian .
we designed a false display with very high resolution , which is much higher than a normal display , and we added additional content .
if you want to see the functions of this car , you can see it here .
or other models , or even technical specifications .
and this really reaches these ideas , these limitations for the available place on the screen .
we hope that it doesn &apos;t mean a pop-up and others , that should not be necessary .
of course , the mapping is one of the really obvious applications for technology like this .
and i really don &apos;t want to spend a lot of time , except to say that we will be involved in this domain .
but these are all the streets in the united states .
over the top of nasa , the picture of nasa .
let &apos;s get something out now .
it &apos;s actually live on the internet now . you can check it out .
this is a project called photosynth , which is really two different technologies together .
one is seadraine , and the other one is a very good research about computer vision , which is a college student student university of university , under the consultion of steve roptz on the uw .
and rick szeliski from microsoft research was done . a very good collaboration .
so this is live on the internet . it &apos;s powered by seadragon .
you can see that when we create these kinds of views , where we can go through images and make this experience of multiresolution .
but the spatial orientation of the images is actually meaning by meaning .
the computer observation algorithms have put together these pictures with the real space that they all have near the grasses in the canadian rockies in the canadian rockies , and they &apos;re looking at these things of stabilized slides , and they were all in relation to each other .
i don &apos;t know if i have time to show you other environments .
there &apos;s a lot of space .
i would like to show straight one of the original data sentences of noah , and that &apos;s from a very early prototype of photosynth that we &apos;ve been working on in summer to show you what i think is really the punchline behind this technology that is photosynths of technology , and this is not necessarily so obvious , if you look at the environments that we have on the website .
we had to worry about the lawyers and so on .
this is a reconstruction of the cathedral , the only in the computer with images of flickr , and just give them an emergency lady in flickr , and they &apos;re going to get pictures of men in t-shirts and on the university site , and so , every one of these atoms is represented as this model .
so this is all patn images , and they &apos;re all in the kind of relationship with each other .
and we can navigate this very simple way .
you know , i never believed that eventually i &apos;m going to work at microsoft .
i &apos;m very grateful for the reception here .
so , i guess you can see that this is a lot of different kinds of cameras : everything is , from the camera camera to professional slrs , a pretty large number of them that have been put together in this environment .
and if possible , i &apos;ll find some of the strange ones .
many of them are covered by faces and so on .
somewhere here is a series of photographs -- here they are .
this is actually a poster from emergency dame , which was recorded .
we can shift from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
the point here is that we can do things with the social environment , and it will now be collected data from all of the collective memory of the whole collective memory of how the earth looks -- and everything will be connected to each other .
all these photos are being connected together , and it creates something larger than the sum of parts .
they get a model that comes from all over the earth .
look at this as the sequel of the work of stephen lawgaman virtual earth .
and this is something that can be used by the complexity that people use , growing and using their use to the user using the use of the use .
their own photos are being violated with metadata , which has a different person .
if someone has made the trouble , and they &apos;ve measured all these sacred , and sharing who they are , then my photo of the emergency cathedral , all of a sudden , put up with all these data , and i can use them as starting to come in to come in with this kind of metaverse , the photos of others .
and of course , side product all of these are the immense virtual models of any interesting part of the earth that &apos;s not just through flights or satellite images and so on , but through collective memory .
thank you .
do you understand it right ? your software allows you to have a certain time in the next few years , all the images that are being used in the world in common with each other in the world .
yes . it doesn &apos;t make anything else to discover .
if you want to create hyperlinks , between the images .
and she does this because of the content in the images .
and that &apos;s really exciting when you think about the amount of semantic information that many of these images have .
as you do a web search for images , where you put sentences and the text of the website contains a lot of information about what the picture is .
but how would it be associated with all their images ?
then the scale of the semantic cross and the abundance that make it really enormous . it &apos;s a classic net effect .
blaise , that &apos;s really incredible . congratulations .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m going to tell you some things from my book , which is how i hope to be in touch with other things that you &apos;ve already heard , and i &apos;m going to try to create some connections if you haven &apos;t noticed that .
i want to start with what i call &quot; official dogma . &quot;
the official dogma of what ?
the official belief of all western industrialized societies .
the official dogma works like this : if our goal is to maximize the public well-being of our citizens , it &apos;s all about the happiest of the individual .
the reason for this is that freedom is good in itself , valuable , useful premise for the human .
if people have freedom , then each of us is for ourselves to do things that our common and nobody has for us .
the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice .
the more choices people have , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , the more common you have .
this is , i think , deep in our water supply that it wouldn &apos;t come in to question .
and it &apos;s also rooted in our lives .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what makes us progress in modern progress .
this is my supermarket . no big .
i just want to say a little bit about salatdots .
there &apos;s 175 dresings in my supermarket , if you don &apos;t count the 10 extra extra olive ooor and 12 balos that you could buy to make a large number of your own pockets , in which unprobable case is not the case for you .
so that &apos;s how the supermarket is .
and then they go to the consumer electronics in order to put a stereo together -- speakers , cd player , a cascide player , radio , stronger . and in this one electronics there is so many strings .
we can put 6.5 million different stereo together from the components that are offered in this business .
you have to admit that this is a big choice .
in other parts -- the world of communication .
there was a time when i was a boy when i was a boy , and you could have every phone that you wanted to do as long as it came from ma bell .
you rented your phone . you didn &apos;t buy it .
a consequence of that was that the phone was never broken .
these days are over .
we have almost an infinite choice now , especially in the mobile phones .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
my favorite one is that in the middle -- mp3-head , nasel haar trimmer and crème brahen .
and if you haven &apos;t seen that yet in your business , you can be sure that you &apos;re going to be there .
and what it does is bring people to the business and ask this question .
now , you know what the answer to this question is ?
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
it &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
in other aspects of life , which is a lot more significant than buying things , the same explosion is going to be the same explosion .
health -- it &apos;s no longer the case in the united states that you go to the doctor and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , they go to the doctor and the doctor says , we could do a , or we could do b .
a has these benefits and risks .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
and they say , &quot; doctor , what do i want to do ? &quot;
the doctor says a has these benefits and risks and b has these benefits and risks .
what do you want to do ?
and if you say , &quot; if you were , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not you . &quot;
the result is -- we call it the patient autonomy . that sounds like a good thing , but in reality , a transition of responsibility for the meeting of someone knows something about someone knows something about someone who doesn &apos;t know anything , and that &apos;s why , in the best condition , is a decision to make -- name the patient .
there &apos;s an enormous marketing for seductive drugs for people like you and me , if you think about it , if you think about it , because we don &apos;t buy them .
why do they advertise us if we can &apos;t buy ?
the answer is : you &apos;ll expect to call us the doctor &apos;s next morning and ask for a change .
something such profound as our identity is now a question of choice , like this slide .
we have no identity , we invent them .
and we invent so often as we want to do .
that means that every day , if you wake up the morning , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time where the standard assumption was that almost every one had one and that &apos;s so fast as you could , and then kids could get like they could .
the only choice was &quot; who , &quot; not when , and not what they did after that .
today , everything is easy to have .
i teach wonderful intelligent students , and i &apos;ll give you 20 percent less work than i used to do .
and not because they &apos;re less smart , and not because they &apos;re less carefully .
it &apos;s because you &apos;re busy with other things , you ask yourself , &quot; should i get married or not ? should i get married ?
should i get married later ? should i have kids , or do i have a career ? &quot;
they &apos;re all asking questions .
and you &apos;ll answer these questions regardless of whether that means to make all the tasks that i &apos;m going to give you and not get a good note in my class .
and in fact , they should do that . these are important questions to answer .
work -- we &apos;re blessed , as carl light has , with the technology that allows us to work every minute from every single day on the planet -- until the marginaliph hotel .
and , by the way , there &apos;s a corner that i &apos;m not going to tell you about , where it works .
i &apos;m not going to tell you , because i want to use it .
so what it means is that this incredible freedom of choice we have in terms of making decisions , again , again and again , whether we should work or not work .
we can play our kids playing football , and we have our mobile phone on the one hip , and our blackberry in others , and our laptop on others , and our laptop on our lap .
and even though they &apos;re all turned off , every minute we &apos;re asking our child in the muze a football game , we &apos;re also saying , &quot; should i take this call ?
should i answer this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
and even though the answer to the question &quot; no , &quot; it &apos;s certainly going to be your child &apos;s experience very different than it would have been .
everywhere we look , big things and small things , material things and lifestyle , life is a question of choice .
and the world we lived in was looking like this .
so i want to say there were some choices , but not all was a question of choice .
and the world that we &apos;re living in now is looking like this .
and the question is , are the good news or bad news ?
the answer is &quot; yes . &quot;
we all know what &apos;s good about it , so i &apos;m going to talk about what &apos;s bad about it .
all these choices have two effects , two negative effects on people .
one effect , paradoxically , is that he &apos;s going to rip out .
so with so many options you can choose , people can get very hard to decide .
i &apos;m going to give you another drastic example of this , a study about investment in volunteers .
a colleague of mine had access to investment records of vanilla , the giant fondans of about a million employees and about 2,000 different jobs .
and what she found was a 10 investment fund that was offered the workforce to take two percent .
they provide 50 investment fund -- 10 percent less employees than if they just offer five . why ?
because it &apos;s 50 investment fund that are available to choice , it &apos;s so hard to decide what to pick up tomorrow .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow is never coming tomorrow .
you know that it &apos;s not just that people need to eat dog food when they go to retirement , because they don &apos;t have enough money to drive it , it means that they &apos;re making a lot of money that &apos;s so hard to pay for their labor players .
they don &apos;t compete until 5,000 of us per year , which would have been happy to multiply their contribution .
paralysis is a consequence of many choices .
and i think it makes the world look like this .
they really want to make the decision right when it &apos;s for all the percals , right ?
they don &apos;t want to choose the wrong investment fund , or even the wrong saline .
so this is one effect . the other effect is that even if we get the paralysis over and make a decision , we end up less content with the outcome of choice , when we had the opportunity to decide between less possibilities .
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is caused by the great selection of different salatings when you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and , you know , that &apos;s perfect -- it &apos;s just that they could have been able to make a different decision , and what &apos;s going on , it &apos;s just that they had a different choice to make the decision , and that regret is negative to the satisfaction they had from their moral decision .
the more opportunities there are , the more easy it is to regret at all , which is disappointing to choice .
secondly , what economists call expertunal costs .
dan gilbert has done a big point today by telling how much the way we evaluate things , depends on what we compare .
well , if there &apos;s a lot of alternatives to think about it , it just turns out to be attractive properties of alternative , that makes them feel less comfortable with the alternatives they chose .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not new york , i &apos;m sorry .
but here &apos;s what they should have thought .
here &apos;s a couple on the hamptons .
very expensive real estate .
beautiful beach . great day . you have everything for yourself .
what could be better ? &quot; the man thinks , &quot; it &apos;s august .
everybody in my manhattan &apos;s neighborhood is gone .
i could park directly my house . &quot;
and he spends two weeks from the thought that he missed the possibility of having a great parking lot .
oppertuning costs reduce happiness , the happiness we get through our selection , even if what we chose is fantastic .
and the more opportunities that there are for choice , the more attractive qualities of these choices are being considered in the opperasy cost .
here &apos;s another example .
now , this cartoon is a few points .
he &apos;s making a statement about it now , and maybe doing things slowly .
but a more important point that he &apos;s doing is always who you decide for one thing , not to do other things .
and these other things like a lot of attractive traits , and it will be what they &apos;re going to do less .
third , escalation of expectations .
this has struck me when i was trying to exchange my jeans .
i &apos;m wearing jeans , almost all the time .
and there was a time in which there were only jeans of a kind , and they bought them , and they &apos;ve misacted , they were incredibly uncompatible , and when they carried them long enough , they started feeling &quot; ok . &quot;
so to buy new jeans for many years of the training , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have some jeans , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
and the salesman said , &quot; do you want a snake , easy or a wide ?
do you want to wash buttons or colorful ? stone or acid ?
do you want jeans with holes ?
you &apos;d like to cut down the bottom , cuky , blah blah blah , blah , &quot; and so on . &quot;
my pine tree was down , and after i came up and told me , &quot; i &apos;d like to have the only way to be the only way . &quot;
he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour trying to try and try all these damn jeans , and the business -- and i say the truth -- with the best frabs i &apos;ve ever had .
i had better . all these choices allowed me to have better .
but i felt bad .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try and explain it to myself .
the reason that i felt bad about this was , with all these options , my expectations , what good for a good pair of jeans , went up .
i had very low expectations . i had no such expectations as it was just in a way .
when they arrived in 100 ways , they should have been perfect .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so i compared what i had to do , and what i was expecting , and what i had was disappointing compared to what i expected .
it &apos;s going to inevitably increase people &apos;s lives into the lives of the people who have increased the expectations of how they &apos;re going to be good for these options .
and this leads to less happiness with the results , even though the results are good .
nobody in the world of marketing knows this because , if you would , you didn &apos;t know what it &apos;s about .
the truth is more like this .
the reason is , that used to be better than anything that was worse than everything was worse , it was possible for people to make a comfortable surprise .
today , in the world that we live in -- we wealthy , industrialized citizens , with perfection as an expectation -- the best for you to be able to do is do things as well as you expect them .
they &apos;re never surprised because their expectations , my expectations , are high .
the secret to happiness -- that &apos;s what you &apos;ve all got -- the secret to happiness is low expectations .
i want to say -- a short autobiographical moment -- that i &apos;m married with a woman , and she &apos;s really wonderful .
i couldn &apos;t have done it better . i didn &apos;t let myself down .
but let &apos;s not always get a bad thing .
after all , a consequence of the purchase of a bad truck when there &apos;s only one way to buy that if you &apos;re unsatisfied , and you wonder why , who is responsible , the answer is clear . what could they have done ?
if hundreds of different types of jeans are available , and they buy the disappointing , and they ask why , who is responsible ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer to the question is : it &apos;s .
they could have done it better .
with 100 different kinds of jeans in the window , there &apos;s no excuse for mistakes .
and so , if people make decisions , and even when the results of decisions are good , they feel disappointed about themselves .
clinical depression exploded in the industrial world in the last generation .
i think a significant -- not the only one , but a significant clper to this explosion of depression , and also suicide , is that people have learned the disappointing because they &apos;re so high . and then , if they have to explain these experiences themselves , it would be their fault .
and so the visual result is that it &apos;s much better in general , objective , and we feel worse .
so let me remind you .
this is the official dogma that we &apos;re all holding for right , completely wrong . it &apos;s not true .
there &apos;s no question , which is a little bit better than no , but it doesn &apos;t follow the more choices than something .
there &apos;s a magical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we haven &apos;t missed this point for a long time on the scale .
now , as a policy question -- i &apos;m almost finished -- as a policy question , which is about thinking about the way that all these choices are in the developed societies , the material is wealth .
there are lots of places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard of many of them whose problem is not the big choice .
your problem is that you have too little .
so things that i &apos;m talking about are a strange problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what &apos;s so frustrating and angry is steve levitt told you yesterday about how these expensive and heavy car seats don &apos;t help . it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy to help them .
they actually hurt .
they worry about that we stand there .
if something of what the people of our society is capable of making decisions about the societies in which people have shifted too little choice , wouldn &apos;t just improve the lives of people , but our dignity will be improved .
economists call this a pareto improvement .
income distribution is that it &apos;s going to be all better -- not just the poor -- because all of these big choices are compgesting us .
finally , please read this cartoon , and , you know , a high-developed person , says , &quot; ah ! what does this fish know ?
you don &apos;t know anything possible in this gold fish glass . &quot;
shaved imagination , a very short view of the world -- and that the way i read it first .
the more i thought about it , the more i came to the point that the fish knows .
because the truth is that if you break the goldfish glass , so that everything is possible , you don &apos;t have any freedom . you have paralysis .
if you break the goldfish glass , so that everything is possible , they reduce happiness .
they increase paralysis and reduce happiness .
everybody needs a gold suit .
this is almost limited to safety safety -- perhaps the fish , definitely for us .
but the abhands of a metaphorical gold fish is a recipe for misery , and i suspect , i guess , disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects before , about the human genome and what that might mean , and the discovery of new groups of genes .
in fact , we start from a new point : we &apos;ve digitized biology and now we try to get from the digital code into a new phase of biology by designing new life and building new life .
we &apos;ve always tried to ask significant questions .
what &apos;s life ? it &apos;s something that i think many biologists have tried to understand and that on different levels .
we &apos;ve tried different approaches to simplify it to the minimum components .
we &apos;ve digitized almost 20 years . when we sequenced the human genome , the shift from the analog world of biology to digital world .
now we &apos;re trying to ask if we can regenerate , or can we make new life , from this digital universe ?
this is the map of a small organism , mycoplasma violin in order to replicate the smallest genome of a species that can replicate itself in the lab , and we &apos;ve tried to do it with a smaller genome .
we did it in about a hundred genes from the 500 or something , which are here .
but if we look at this metabolic map , which is very simple , compared to our . trust me , that &apos;s easy , but if we look at all these genes that we can eliminate one after the other , it &apos;s very unlikely to have a living cell .
so we decided that it &apos;s the only way to get forward to this chromosome , which allows us to vary what allows us to vary the components and make some of these fundamental questions .
and so we started with the question , can we have a chromosome synthetic ?
does it allow the chemistry to create this really big molecules , which has never been done before ?
and , if we can do that , we can start the chromosome ?
a chromosome is just a piece of static chemical material .
our steps at the beginning of life were exponentially .
our ability to write genetic code has evolved very slowly yet , but our last point would be now on an exponential curve .
we started with this 15 years ago .
it actually took a few years of starting with a bioethical review before we did the first experiments .
as it turns out , dna synthetic tization is very difficult .
there are tens of thousands of machines making around the world that can make small pieces of dna , 30 to 50 letters long , but it &apos;s a degenerative process , so the longer you have a piece of power .
so we had to develop a new way that we put these little pieces together and correct the mistakes .
this was our first attempt , starting with the digital information , the genome phi x 174 .
it &apos;s a small virus of bacteria .
we made small pieces , made a flaire correction and had a dna molecule about 5,000 letters .
the exciting phase came when we took this piece of informed chemical and put it into a bacterium , and the bacteria started reading the genetic code and made a viral particles .
the viral particles were released by the cells and came back and killed and killed .
recently , i &apos;ve spoken to the oil industry , and they said that this model is very simplistic .
they laughed more than they do here .
so we think that this is a situation in the software that can actually build your hardware in a biological system .
but we wanted to go much further . we wanted to build a whole bacterium chromosome , and it has more than 880,000 letters genetic code . so we thought we could build it in cassits from the size of the fish to understand what the individual components are of a living cell .
design is the key , and if you want to start with digital information in the computer , this digital information really needs to be error .
first of all , when we first sequenced the genome in 1995 , the error rate was an error per 10,000 base pairs .
we found 30 mistakes in reslight . if we had used the original sequence it would never have been possible .
part of the design of design is to make pieces of the 50 letters long and have to have pieces of other 50-letter pieces to build smaller areas that fit these together .
we &apos;ve built unique elements here .
you may have heard that we have watermarks built .
think about it : we have a four-letter code : a , c , g and t.
triplets of this letter -- these letters encode about 20 amino acids , and there &apos;s a single purpose for each of these amino acids .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , sentences , thoughts .
we just started writing at first .
some people were disappointed that it was not poetry .
we designed the pieces so that we could just break them down with enzymes , and there are enzymes that put them together .
and we started making pieces , starting with pieces of the five-up letters to the seventh of people , and to put these together around 24,000-letter pieces in order to assemble this back to 72,000 .
in every step , we have made these pieces in the overshot so we could sequence them , because we tried to create a very robust process what they &apos;re going to see in a minute .
we &apos;ve tried to get to the car intervention .
so , this looks like a basketball playoff .
if we get to these really large bits -- over 100,000 base pairs -- then these aren &apos;t going to be growing in e. , all the way over the modern molecular biology . and so we turned to other mechanisms .
we knew about a mechanism of homologist recombination , the biology used to repair dna , which can put these pieces together .
here &apos;s an example of it . there &apos;s an organism called denococcka radio radiation over the three million raunds .
you see in the upper field that his chromosome just falls apart .
12 to 24 hours later , everything brought together as it was .
we have thousands of organisms who can do this .
these organisms can be frozen , they can even live in the vacuum .
i &apos;m absolutely sure life exists in space and can move to looking for aquatic conditions .
in fact , nasa has shown that there are lots of things out there .
here &apos;s a shot of the molecule that we &apos;ve made by using these processes -- in fact , we &apos;ve only used hefed mechanisms with the right design of the pieces we have in it . yeast then cuts together .
this is not a electron microscope recording it &apos;s a regular microphoto .
it &apos;s such a large molecule that we can even see it with the light microscope .
these are footage about a period of six seconds .
that &apos;s the publication we &apos;ve just done recently .
these are over 580,000 letters of genetic code . it &apos;s the largest molecule that has ever been created by people .
it &apos;s got a molecular weight of over 300 million .
if we were to print it by a 10-to-one framework , it would be 142 pages , just to print this genetic code .
now , how do we start a chromosome ? how do we activate it ?
obviously , it &apos;s very simple with a virus . it &apos;s much more complicated dealing with bacteria .
it &apos;s also easier if you &apos;re in eukaryones like we &apos;re , you just take the nuclear out and gives you a different in , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;ve all heard about cloning .
archaebacteria is the chromosome embedded in the cell , but recently we &apos;ve shown that you can do a full transplant of the chromosome from a cell to another , and that activates .
we clean up the chromosome of a microspecies , and we &apos;ve been told about these two as far as humans and mice . we gave some extra genes to pick this chromosome , and we were able to pick it up with enzymes to destroy all the proteins , and it was very amazing as we put it into a cell -- and it &apos;s very amazing as we put it in a cell .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
in fact , we thought that this is the end , but we tried to do something further .
that &apos;s the main mechanism of evolution here .
we find all kinds of species here that have taken a second chromosome or a third of any , thousands of characteristics in just a second to a species .
so , people who think of evolution as a gene will have changed a lot of the biology at a time .
there are enzymes called the restriction senals , which actually digest dna .
the chromosome that was in the cell has no one ; the chromosomes we &apos;ve added .
it got exprited in the cell and realized the other chromosome as a stranger material , and so we just ended up with a cell with a new chromosome .
it was coloring blue because of the genes we added .
and after a very short time , it had lost all of the characteristics of species and completely in a new species based on the new software that we gave into the cell .
all the proteins changed the membranes -- when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we &apos;ve been doing .
it sounds like genome alchimie , but we can , by changing the software dna , make things quite dramatic .
now , i argued that this is not the vegetation -- that &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years of evolution .
and i argued that we might be able to create a new form of the camel explosion in which there might be massive new species of biology based on this digital design .
why should we do that ?
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
we are growing by six and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
to put it in my context , i was born in 1946 .
today , three people on this planet in 1946 has existed ; within 40 years , it will be four .
we have problems with food , with fresh and clean water , medicine , fuel for 6.5 billion people .
it &apos;s going to offer a challenge for nine .
we need about five billion tons of coal , 30 plus billions of barrels of oil . that &apos;s a hundred million barrels per day .
if we think about biological processes or some processes to replace it , it will be a huge challenge .
then , of course , there &apos;s all the co2 from this material that goes into the atmosphere .
we now have our discoveries from the world , a database with about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the design components of the future .
the electric oil industry had a dozen components and look at the diversity of it that came out of it .
we &apos;re very first on the limits of the biological reality and in those of our ideas .
we have technology today because of this fast portal of what we call combined genetics .
now we have the opportunity to build a large robot that can make millions of chromosomes a day .
if you can imagine these 20 million different genes , or to optimize this processes to create ococness or drugs , we can change with just a small team of molecular biology than the last 20 years science .
and it &apos;s just a few times of selection . we can afford to be selective , production of chemicals or fuel production production and so on .
this is a shot of effective design software that we &apos;re working on , which you actually sit down and design new species on the computer .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know how it &apos;s going to look . we know exactly how their genetic code is going to look .
we &apos;re now focusing on the fourth generation .
you &apos;ve seen corn corn recently , which is a bad experiment .
we &apos;ve got fuel of the two-ten- and third generation that will get a lot higher , the amount of sugar that we &apos;re going to have , as penelope or different kinds of butanol .
but , as we think , the only way of dealing with biology is a huge impact without the cost of the cost of food , or the restoration of their availability , if we see co2 as the initial material , and so we &apos;re working on cells that go that way .
and we think that we will be the first generation of the fourth generation , and in about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
but in our discovery of the world , we all have different ways .
this is an organism we described in 1996 .
he lives in the deep sea , about one-and-a-half miles deep , in nearly cooking water temperatures .
it &apos;s turning co2 into methane around the use of hydrogen as a source .
we &apos;re looking at if we can use carbon co2 , which could just be made up to production , to build the co2 pollution in order to do this process .
within a short period of time , we think we could be able to solve one of the fundamental questions of life .
you know , we really -- moderate goals like the whole petrochemical industry . right . if you couldn &apos;t do that at ted , where else ? a central source of energy .
but the same thing we &apos;re working on right now is using the same approaches to use vaccines .
you saw this year with flu , we &apos;re always a year back , and we have a dollar too little when it comes to the right vaccine .
i think that can be changed by creating reformation vaccines in the suburbs .
this is what the future might look like with changes , can be accelerating today with synthetic bacteria , archains , and perhaps eukaryonites .
we are made of improving people for light away , and our goal is that we have a chance to survive long enough to be able to do that . thank you very much .
on the last ted conference , i gave an introduction to the lhc .
and i promised to come back to explain how the machine works .
so it &apos;s so far . and for all those who weren &apos;t there , the lhc is the largest scientific experiment ever -- 27 miles in diameter .
his job is to create conditions that exist less than a billionth second after the beginning of the universe -- and to 600 million times in a second .
it &apos;s just breathambitious .
this is the machine underneath gene .
we take images of this mini-big all in detectors .
i &apos;m working on this . it &apos;s called atlas detector -- 44 meters in the width , 22 feet in diameter .
here &apos;s a spectacular picture of atlas in the construction system that you see the scale .
on september 10th last year , the machine went to the first time .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
it caused enormous judaism in the control room .
it &apos;s a picture of the first profuction note that put all the way back to the lhc , and then to reconnect with a part of the lhc to make a rain of particles on the detector .
in other words , when we saw this picture of september september , we knew that the machine works , which is a great triumph .
i don &apos;t know if this is the biggest jeil , or this , when someone went to the google side and found the front page .
it means that we have a cultural impact next to the scientific .
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine to do with these wires -- this golden wires here .
these wires are generating 13-thousand ampes when the machine runs on high-performance .
well , the engineers under them will look at them and say , &quot; no , don &apos;t do it . these are little wires . &quot;
you can afford that because if you put it very far , it &apos;s going to be called supersuperas .
so in minus 271 degrees , as the space between the stars , these wires can make the tension .
in one of the connections between 300 thousand magnets in the lhc , there was a circuit defect .
so , in this case , the wires clean up the wires and 13-thousand ampes all of a sudden .
this was the result .
now , all of this is even more amazing when you imagine that the magnets weigh over 20 tons and shift about 30 inches .
so we damaged about 50 of the magnets .
and they had to remove what we did .
we cover them , rerepair them .
they &apos;re all back on their way back .
at the end of march , the lhc will be able to reoperate .
we &apos;re going to put it on , and we expect to collect the first data in june or july , and we move our journey to figure out what the building blocks are of the universe .
now , of course , in a way that these accidents are again , the debate about the value of science and engineering in such boundaries . it &apos;s easy to dismiss something .
i think the fact that it &apos;s so hard to make the fact that we reach beyond our limitations , the value of things like the lhc .
i &apos;m going to leave my final words on a english scientist scientist . humphrey davy , who , as i suspect , is when he defended the abusing experiments of his teaching , his teaching michael was michael faraday , which is said , &quot; nothing is so dangerous for the development of the human mind , &quot; which is that our scientific beliefs are not so dangerous . &quot;
thank you .
i &apos;m a writer .
writing books is my job , but it &apos;s of course more than that .
it &apos;s also my big , lifelong love and fascination .
and i don &apos;t expect that to change .
but it &apos;s a little bit shorter in my life and my career , which has made me rethink my relationship to this work completely .
this particular event was that i was writing a book recently -- a biography called the mathemaids , migraine , love , love -- that , like all my previous books out of some of my previous books , went out to the world , and a big mega-event , an international event .
the result is that i don &apos;t care where i &apos;m coming from , i &apos;m going to be treated .
seriously -- the rise .
for example , are you going to worry about me and say , &quot; do you fear that you never meet this success ?
don &apos;t you fear that you &apos;re going to write your whole life and never create a book that &apos;s interested in somebody in the world ? -- is it ?
okay , that really makes courage .
however , it would be worse if i didn &apos;t remember that i was talking about 20 years ago when i first said that i wanted to be a teenager , with the same kind of fear of kindness .
people said , &quot; do you have no fear , never to succeed ?
do you have no fear that the humiliation is going to take off ?
don &apos;t you fear that you leave your life for your life and never get something that you &apos;re going to die on , and that you &apos;re going to die on a curved hall -- your mouth filled with the bitter wides of failure ?
like that , you know .
the answer -- the short answer to all these questions is : aliens .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
and i had it .
and i have a lot more of things before , which no one would recognize .
like algae -- and other terrible things .
but , if it &apos;s about writing , i &apos;ve been thinking about it , and ask me , why ?
is that sensible ?
is it logical that someone should be afraid that he was afraid to do the work he feels ?
and what exactly happened to the creative enterprise that they &apos;re making us feel insecure about mutual mental state -- in a way that it doesn &apos;t do other professions ?
my father , for example , was chemists , and i can &apos;t remember it in his 40 years as a chemist that he asked whether he was afraid to be chemists .
with your chemist &apos;s blockade , john — how about you ?
it just wasn &apos;t , you know ?
but to be fair -- the group of chemists don &apos;t have the reputation of the alcohol addictive people .
we also seem to have this kind of call to have this kind of call , but not just the writers , but the creative of all genres seem to have this call , mental unstable .
all they need to do is to look at the bitmore death rates of really great minds from the 20th century , who died and often died from their own hand .
and even the ones who don &apos;t actually commit suicide seemed to be really neglected by their talents .
norman mamore , briefly said before his death in his last interview , has killed me a little bit more on my own books , a little further .
an extraordinary statement that you can do about your life .
but we don &apos;t even know if we hear somebody like this , because we &apos;ve known this kind of statements for this long time , and somehow we have the perception of this and collective that creativity and suffering , of course , that art -- always leads to the sea .
the question i want to ask everyone here today is : is this idea for you all right ?
if you think about it ? because with just one centimeter away -- i feel that i don &apos;t think that &apos;s an explanation .
i find them cool .
and i find them dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to watch how they get taken over the next century .
i find it better if we encourage our great creative commitment to life .
and i definitely know that it &apos;s for me -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start this dark path of thought -- especially in the fact that i &apos;m in my career .
this is -- you see , i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m just about 40 years old .
i may have another 40 years in me .
and it &apos;s extremely likely that everything i &apos;m going to write from now in the world as the work of the world , that came to the front of my last book , right ?
i say it straight , because we &apos;re all kind of friends right now -- it &apos;s extremely likely that my greatest success is behind me .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
these are the kinds of thoughts that you can do to start drinking 9 o &apos;clock in the morning , and i don &apos;t want that .
i would rather continue to do this work that i love .
so the question is : how ?
after some time of reflection , i seem to realize that to continue to write , i have to design a kind of local psychological apparatus .
in some way , i have to figure out a way to write a safe distance between me and my very natural , like the reaction to the written .
while i looked at models for the last year to do that , i also looked for the past and i tried to find other societies to see if they might have better or rational ideas about whether you could help the creative risks associated with creativity .
this quest me in the old greece , and the old rome .
please follow me because the circle will come back .
but in the old greece and rome , people didn &apos;t believe that creativity comes from people , ok ?
they believed that creativity was a kind of divine spirit that comes from a distant , unknown source to the people -- from unison , unknown reasons .
the greeks called these divine dicts of creativity prisoners of creativity .
now , socrates is known that he believed he would have had a chamon , who made him out of a distance .
they had the same idea , the same kind of body of body creative mind , a prestige genius .
this is great . the roman thought didn &apos;t really think that a genius was a particularly clever individual .
they believed that a genius was this kind of magical divine creature , which was believed that it lives literally in the walls of an artist &apos;s walls -- about like dobby , the home11 -- that would come in and create the artists in the work of work .
this is brilliant -- it &apos;s because it &apos;s the distance that i talked about -- the psychological constructive , which protect you from the consequences of your work .
and everybody knew that it worked like this , right ?
the artist of aging was kind of protected things , like , for example , too much narcisissm , right ?
if your work was brilliant , you didn &apos;t look at everything for you . everybody knew you had this body genius that helped you .
if your work was packed -- not completely your mistakes , right ?
everybody knew your genius was something delicious .
so the people in the west have really been thinking about creativity for a long time .
and then the renaissance and everything changed . we had this big idea , and this big idea was : let &apos;s put the human individual at the center of the universe -- about all the gods and mystery , and there &apos;s no room more for mystical creatures , the trains of divinity .
it &apos;s the beginning of rational humanism and the people started to believe that creativity came from their own individual .
for the first time in history , people are listening to this guy or an artist -- instead of that he has a genius .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
you know ? i think to allow a blog person to think he &apos;s thinking , or it &apos;s like the cylinder , and the essence and the source of all of the divine , creative , unfamiliar , unfamiliar , infinite mysteries is a little bit of responsibility to raise a human psyche .
it &apos;s like asking somebody to swallow the sun .
and it turns out , and it warps all the egos and it creates all these unavailable expectations on success .
i think that these successes have increased our artists for the last 500 years .
and , if that &apos;s true , and i think it &apos;s true -- is the question .
can we change it ?
maybe an aging understanding of the relationship between people and mystery of creative return .
maybe not .
maybe we can &apos;t just make the thought of 500 years of human humanism in a 18 minute talk .
and there are certainly people in this audience who would express a really distorted scientific doubt about the notion of -- basically -- feen , the people and feenmagic magic on their projects and so on .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey .
but the question i want is : why not ?
why not think about that ?
because it makes a lot of sense as much as anything i &apos;ve heard of when it was about explaining the absolutely crazy capality of the creative process .
a process that -- like everybody knows that it has ever tried to do something -- so in other words , everyone here -- not always sensible .
in fact , he can feel really paranormal .
i had recently met a encounter as i met the extraordinary american dictionin ruth stone , which is now over 90 , but it was their entire life for the long life , and she told me that she was growing out in the coursable virginia , she said , &quot; she would feel like a poem about the landscape on her . &quot;
she would say it would be like an idiot of air .
the country on them would roll up .
she felt like it came , because it would bring the earth underneath her feet .
she knew that she could only do one of these at a moment , and that was -- in her words , it &apos;s -- in her words , like the devil .
they ran like the devil to the house during this poem , and it was only that they had to get fast enough to get a sheet of paper and a pen , so they had to get it through , and put it through , and put it through the sheet .
in other words , she wasn &apos;t fast enough . she ran and ran and ran , but she didn &apos;t get the house , and she went through the house , and she said it through her , and she would go on , and she would go to another poet .
and then there were these moments -- the part i &apos;m never going to forget -- she said that there were eye moments in which they had almost covered it .
so , she goes to the house , and she &apos;s looking for paper and the poem runs through her and she grabs a pencil right now as she goes through and then -- she said -- she was like this as a dignity of her other hand .
she got the poem in his tail , and she pulled it back into her body and took it to the sheet of paper .
in these opportunities , the poem came down , and intact on the paper -- but backwards -- the last word for the first .
when i was listening to that , i thought that i was really -- that &apos;s just like my creative process is going on .
it &apos;s not like my creative process -- i &apos;m not the channel !
i &apos;m a mapet animal . so to work , i have to get up to the same time every day and sweat me , and i &apos;m really uncomfortable .
but even i have that thing in my mouth , sometimes that thing .
and i guess many of you have done that too .
even i had work or ideas that came from a source to me that i really couldn &apos;t identify .
what is that thing for ?
and how do we deal with it in relation to our minds , but even to keep us in the opposite of intellectual health ?
for me , the best example of how you can do this is the musician tom waits . i was interviewing him a magazine for a magazine .
we talked about this issue , and you know what ? most of his life was tom who was the embodiment of the geigigigte modern artist who was trying to replicate this uncontrolled creative impulse in him and with them .
but then he became older and quiet . he told me that he was driving on a faster street in los angeles , and it changed everything for him .
he was driving at high speed as he suddenly heard a little bit of a melody , which , as it is in inspiration , is hard for him to be fake , and he wants to have it , and he &apos;s not able to grab it , but he can &apos;t touch it .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a pen , he doesn &apos;t have a tape record .
so he starts , and he &apos;s going to get this old frack in him , like a neanderthal i &apos;m going to lose this thing , and i &apos;m going to be separated by this song forever .
i &apos;m not good enough , i can &apos;t do it .
but instead of hiding in panic , he just stopped .
he finished all the lawmentation and did something completely new .
he just looked in the sky and said , &quot; well , excuse me , can &apos;t you see that i drive car ? &quot;
so , what do i look like as if i could write a song right now ?
if you really want to exist , come back to a more cheap moment , when i can take care of you .
if not , you have somebody else .
go and source leonard cohen .
his whole process has changed after that .
not the work itself . that was still the same as dark and ever .
but the process and the heavy yield that surrounds him was , as he took the genius out of it , where he didn &apos;t take it in trouble , and then let him go back to where he came from . he realized that it didn &apos;t have to be internally .
it could give a owners , miraculous , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and the stranger , which was not quite tom .
when i heard this story , it was a little bit like the way i worked and it has been saved .
this idea saved me when i was in the middle of the kind of mind-wandering process of sexing , parkinson &apos;s love , and i fell into one of these two of the two-rock rock that we all fall into when we &apos;re working on something and it doesn &apos;t work . it &apos;s going to be a disaster that has ever been written .
not just bad , but the worst of all time .
i started thinking , i should just take this project out .
but then i remembered how tom was talking in the free sky , and i tried it .
so i raised my view of the manuscript , and i talked to my comment towards a blank corner of the space .
i said , &quot; listen , you know , you know , you and i all know when this book is brilliant , that it &apos;s not completely my fault , right ?
because you see i have everything i have , investment . i don &apos;t have more than that .
so if you want to have better , you have to check up here and hold your share of the bottom .
okay . but if you don &apos;t do that -- you know what the hell is .
i &apos;ll still keep writing , because that &apos;s my job .
and i want to ask you to know that i was here for my part of the jobs here .
because ... at the end of it , it &apos;s like the following of centuries , in the deserts north america , to the mola of holy dancers and music , the hours they have gotten -- until dawn .
these were always great , because the dancers were professional and they were fantastic .
but back and again , very rare , something special happened . one of the daran , actually .
and i know that you know what i mean , because i know you &apos;ve all seen this kind of performance in your life .
it was when it was time , and the dancer came through a kind of pfored . he didn &apos;t do anything different than he ever did before -- 1,000 nights before , but everything combined .
and all of a sudden he didn &apos;t get in human .
it was illuminated by the inside and the bottom light and everything lit up through a divine fire .
as something happened , people knew what this was . they called it his name .
they put the hands together and they started singing : migraallah , allah , allah , god , god , god .
that &apos;s god , you know ?
interesting historic footnote : when the mockets took place in spain , they took this practice , and the language changed over the centuries of prisoners , allah , allah , olene liverolé , olé , olé , olé , that you still hear with and flencocoings .
if a single character in spain has done something impossible , a little bit of magic : carcinoallah , olé , olé , olame , allah , great , brown , brown , vo .
and that &apos;s great , because we need it .
but , the tricky part follows the next morning when the dancers wake up itself and realize it &apos;s 11 o &apos;clock on a tuesday -- and he &apos;s no longer a fifth of god .
he &apos;s just an aging predator with painful kel , and maybe he &apos;s never going to go back to those heights .
and maybe someone will never call god &apos;s name if he turns . but what does he want to do with the rest of his life ?
that &apos;s hard .
this is one of the most painful bias of a creative life .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so full of pa if you didn &apos;t believe that the most extraordinary aspects of your existence would come from you .
if you just believe that you &apos;re a disruption -- from an unreasonable source for a reversion of your life that &apos;s passed on to somebody else if you &apos;re done with it .
if we start thinking about this , it changes everything .
so i started thinking , and i think of security in the last few months , while i was working on the book , which is soon going to appear -- when the dangerous , scary , hard anticipated of my being .
what i always have to say is , if i &apos;m going to get crazy about it , i have no fear .
don &apos;t be made .
just do your job .
be there forever , whatever he wants to be .
if your job is dancing , dance .
if that &apos;s the stupid divine genius that you put on the side , you decide to show a little bit of wonder of miracles through your effort , then lexicoolé !
and if not , dance is your dance .
and lexicoolé ! diarrhea for you despite all this .
i believe in it , and i feel that we should teach the lessons .
cesolé ! diarrhea for you despite all of you , just that you have the mere human love and your sense of being there .
thank you .
thank you .
olé !
last year , i showed these two slides to illustrate that the arctic ice cream , which had nearly three million years of the size of the lower 48 states in order to tear 40 percent .
but this doesn &apos;t press enough the seriousness of this particular problem , because it doesn &apos;t show the thickness of ice .
in a way , the arctic ice caps is the beating heart of our global climate system .
it grows in winter and shrinking in the summer .
the next slide i &apos;m showing you is a time-lapse recording of what happened in the last 25 years .
the permanent ice is labeled with red .
as you can see , it &apos;s growing on the dark blue . this is the march of ice in winter ; and it &apos;s shrinking in summer .
what &apos;s called permanent ice , five years old or older , is almost like blood , which comes out of the body here .
in 25 years , it &apos;s gone from here to here .
this is a problem , because warming gives rise to the frozen bottom of the arctic ocean , where there are large amounts of frozen carbon , which , if he &apos;s picking up , is used by microbes to methane .
compared to the entire amount of climate change in the atmosphere , that amount could double when we cross this critical point .
already today , in some flat lakes in alaska , methane from itself .
professor katey , at the university of alaska , is traveled to a different set of work in the last winter of winter .
wow !
it &apos;s good . the question is , how is it going to sum us up ?
and one of the reasons is that this huge deforestation of deforestation greenland from north .
this is an annual breakwater river .
but the volume are much bigger than ever before .
this is the canary river in southern west greenland .
if you want to know how the sea level goes up across the ice ice , you &apos;re going to put it in the ocean .
these rivers take rapid rise .
on the other end of the planet , antarctica , the biggest ice mass on the planet .
last month , researchers reported that the entire continent has a negative ice shelf .
and the west antarctica , which showed up over a few sub-islands , is very strong in the melting .
this is 20 feet of sea land , like greenland .
in the himalayas , the third largest ice mass , you see new lakes in front of a few years ago .
40 percent of all people in the world get half of their fingers from this melting water .
in the dean , this glacier is the sterile water source for this city .
the amount of water has expanded .
but if you run away , most of the drinking water will fall away .
in california , there was a 40 percent reduction in california in california .
this is the storage basin .
and the predictions , as you read them , are serious .
these austrofents in the world leads to a dramatic increase in fire .
and the disasters all over the world have gone up in a truly extraordinary and unprecedented way .
four times in the last 30 years in the last 30 years .
this is a completely unsustainable fashion pattern .
if you look at this in the historical context , you can see what it does .
in the last five years , we have produced 70 million tons of co2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons every day in the oceans .
if you look at the area of the eastern pacific , the american continent , western and bystanding of the indian subcontinent , where there &apos;s a dramatic decline in the ocean .
the biggest one factor for global warming , beyond deforestation , which is 20 percent , is burning of fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the biggest problem .
the united states is one of the two largest polluters , together with china .
and the suggestion was to build a lot more carbon factories .
but we &apos;re starting to see change .
here are the ones in the last few years , with some green alternatives that were proposed .
we have a political argument in our country .
and the cohling , and the oils have spent a quarter billion dollars last year to spend clean coal , to use clean coal , which is a contradiction in itself .
this picture reminded me of something .
by christmas , i went home in tennessee , a billion tons of kohlls .
you saw it in the news .
this is in our entire country of the second largest waste of america .
this was about christmas .
one of the commercials of kohling industry was about christmas .
frosty the hydroman is a pleasure , happy burker .
there &apos;s in skin and abundance in america , and it helps to grow our economy .
frosty , the coal is clean every day .
he &apos;s affordable and loving , and men remain in puhn and bread .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
the most powerful mountain worker is the leader of massey charcoal .
let me tell you a very clear . al gore , nancy pelosi , harry riosi , you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
so the alliance for climate protection is called two campaigns to life .
this is one part of her .
in the coalergy , we see climate change as a serious danger for our business .
that &apos;s why we put it on the top stage , a sizable amount of money to spend an ad on the way to get the truth about coal .
in fact , coal is not messy .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it also smells good .
so , you don &apos;t worry about the climate change .
leave it to us .
dinosaurs , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
so let &apos;s make a tour of this modern , clean coal factory .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty loud .
but it &apos;s the sound of the clean coal technology .
and yet the burning of coal is one of the main reasons for global warming , the remarkable clean coal technology that you see here changes everything .
look at it , this is the today , clean coal technology .
finally , the positive alternative with our economic challenge and our challenge of national security .
america is in a crisis that , the national security , the climate crisis .
the red thread that connects all these together is our dependence on carbon pollution , like dirty charcoal and foreign oil .
but now there &apos;s a bold , new solution to get us out of that wrong situation .
care of america with 100 percent clean electricity in the next 10 years .
a plan to bring america back to work , make us safer and help the global warming .
finally , a solution that is big enough to solve our problems .
care of america . find more .
this is the last one .
it &apos;s about a new supply of america .
one of the fastest ways , our dependence of old , dirty fuel materials that are killing our world .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
new investments , to create good paying jobs .
health is new . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
there &apos;s an old african saying , &quot; if you want to be quick , go alone .
if you want to come far together . &quot;
we have to go far , and it &apos;s fast .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to start by asking you to think about the time of your childhood when you were playing with a builder .
as they realized how to stretch out the hands and grab the blade of sound and move it , they actually learned to think and change problems through understanding and changing interactions .
the spatial thinking is deeply connected to how we understand a lot of our environment .
as a computer scientist , inspired by the way of our interaction with real objects -- with my professional advisti and my colleagues &apos; colleagues , i began to wonder , what if we could use computers to use that instead of a mouse record that could move like a digital fingertip , and they could actually apply it to how we want it ?
this question was so profound that we decided to get the answer to the answer , and we were working .
in short , a sion-able is an interactive computer in the size of a cone .
you can be moved with your hand , you can see each other , you can detect your movements and have a screen and you have a screen .
much more importantly : are physically , physically , why you can just move it through the hands of hands and access your hands .
and the siwers are an example of a new generation of aid to manipulation digital data .
and if these tools become more of the body and create an awareness for their movements , they recognize each other and perceive the enemies of our orbit with them , we can begin to start with new and entertaining interaction species .
i start with some simple examples .
this sion-able is reviewing for the video configurization and when i put it in a direction , the video will move forward ; if i put it in the other direction , it &apos;s going backwards .
and these interactive portraits take each other true .
so if i put them side-by-side , they make interest .
if you &apos;re a straight surrounded , you &apos;ll notice that and you can get nervous .
and they also feel their movements and push .
an interesting consequence of interactions that we started to realize was that we could apply everyday gestures on data , like colors to how to deal with it .
in this case , we have three siftals as a dyid of color configurization and i can use them to pour color in the middle , where they &apos;re going to mix .
if we push it over , we can break a little bit back .
also , there are also some nice opportunities in education as languages , mathematics or logical games , where we give people the possibility of fast trial and the results immediately .
here i am -- this is a fibonacci series that i &apos;m dealing with with a very simple device .
this is a game with words , which is a kind of mixture of scrabble and boggle .
basically , you get every round on every siftable randomly random random letter , and as you try to form words , these are about a dictionary .
then , after about 30 seconds , again , it &apos;s mixed and you have a new letter combination and new possibilities .
thank you .
these are some kids who came to the media lab , and i could move them to try and try it and have a video of it .
they really loved it .
an interesting fact about this kind of applications is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
all you have to say is , &quot; are the words , &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
here &apos;s a couple of people who test it .
this is our very recent nightmare down there .
it turns out that he just wanted to stack up a stack .
so for him , they were just building .
this is an interactive spell .
we wanted to develop a tool for language learning .
this is felix .
he can bring new characters into the scene by raising the sippeable of the table that shows this character .
here he gets the sun up .
the sun goes on .
now he gets a tractor in the scene .
the orange tractor .
good work ! yes !
by the time he &apos;s shaking , and she can make the characters interact by side .
... his own story .
hello !
it &apos;s a story with open end and he can decide how to evolve .
flying cat .
the last example that i &apos;ve been doing today is to show you , it &apos;s a music sequencing for live , which we have recently developed and in the sion as notes , as leadership , bass and cratay .
each one has four different variations ; you can choose , which you want to use .
and you can put these notes into the sequence that you can rearrange in any patterns .
and you &apos;re eating them by simply holding a ton of light into a sequence .
there are effects that you can change , like hall and filters .
you put it together with a particular tone and tends to hire it .
and then more obese effects like speed and volume that you use on the entire sequence .
so let &apos;s take a look .
we &apos;re starting to feed the leadership in two sequencing siftable , and these in a series , they expand and add a bit more of the voice .
now i add a bass .
now i &apos;m going to do something about this .
and now i &apos;m making the filter with the crackers , so i can drive the effect of live .
i can go all the sequence up by having the pace in one direction or another .
and now i &apos;m making the filter with the bass ; for something more expression .
i can put the sequence in the course of it .
so , i don &apos;t have to plan them in the field , but can improvise ; they &apos;re going to get out of it .
and finally , i can throw out the whole sequence by spreading the sound of the sound to the left .
thank you .
so , as you can see , my desire is to develop new human-computer , which is better to fit , how our brains and bodies work .
and today i had time to show you a part of this new design world and some of the possibilities of what we &apos;re working on in our lab .
the idea that i want to leave you with is that we &apos;re standing on the verge of this new generation of value to interaction with digital media that brings information into our world , which is our demands .
thank you .
i &apos;m very pleased to talk to you .
yeah , good day .
i &apos;m glad i &apos;m there .
yeah , so what &apos;s going to be biohacking ?
i have to take a little out of that , and that &apos;s biohacking with the modern molecular biology .
i study molecular biology , and i &apos;ve just been studying a few years of the biohacking , and that &apos;s what i started , because i just wanted to know a little bit , and it really wanted to do whatever i learned in the study of neuroscience .
so , that was my primary motivation .
so it was a curiosity , and i wanted to kind of go closer to the matter .
i think the molecular biology in general now is in general , so in general , biotechnology , everything you count , synthetic biology and so on .
extremely important is now extremely important , and much more importantly will be in the future .
there &apos;s so controversial things like this all across the mountain plants .
there are now craig venter in the united states trying to make biofighters , so gas from algae .
and then there &apos;s a lot of things that have been stuck in the everyday life , which most people aren &apos;t aware of , for example , detergent enzymes that allow us to wash four degrees of laundry , are also genetically optimistic enzymes .
and the list can continue to continue .
and so from the interest in this technology , i &apos;m just going on there .
so what &apos;s going on ?
most people know what most people know from the software block .
computer hacking , and then it &apos;s always going to break in the media , yes , the hackers break somewhere and claws and so on .
this is a very sad scene for hacking scene , because that doesn &apos;t happen in what you actually did , and what &apos;s really behind it .
and the software hacker , in the &apos; 70s , started with computer construction , and it &apos;s also created the internet .
and it &apos;s about acting on a playful , creative , original way to solve a problem .
and problem , it &apos;s not just a technical problem , it can be a social problem , it can also be a problem of a problem , which is how things simplify , so any problem problem , to throw a question , and how you can do that differently or how you can do that .
and it turned out to be with software , but there &apos;s also in the electric area , because there &apos;s also a whole series of builsions that are doing all sorts of things with electric circuits .
and now in the direction of biology , and i want to leave this metaphor that comes from the synthetic biology , that biology is actually a information science , because the d.n.a code is an abstract code , which is yes , it &apos;s not quite the same as computers , because it &apos;s a real matter , and not just cyber .
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can also program , and you can also hack it , so you can also find it , and i found this incredibly fascinating , and i just wanted to get a lot deeper with it .
this actually has taken a two-thousand eight really eight , these networks .
there &apos;s hackers liverdot org , which is originally from switzerland , which is with europe and with an cooperation in india , but now members or active people all over the world .
this is a more artistic orientation , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers , and in collaboration with scientists with scientists , just with these technologies and asking questions about the creative , there &apos;s a museum shows and yes , there &apos;s all kinds of things .
but it &apos;s actually all about finding such a lockless access , such a playful way to have it .
and then there &apos;s do-it-yourself organic dot org , d.i.y.bio .
this is from the united states a network , which is actually more like a kind of forum , where where you get stuck and online .
these are a little bit more technical , and also a little bit of business along the way , and then they &apos;re asked to ask , yes .
and based on these networks that have done the whole popular , there &apos;s a scene that i &apos;d just like to warn you .
here in the upper left , you see biodegradation , which is a hackerspace , which is basically a school , a private school , a nonprofit institution , where everybody can come .
kids , old , all kinds of people , to just throw away with it , they &apos;ve set up a lab and look at what can be done when these lab tracks .
and on the bottom here is a group in indonesia , houame binnatural oxide called the ones that are already quite a long time .
longer than these other two networks .
they &apos;re also involved in such an artistic aspect with biological materials , and , yes , electric builders , and combine it in quite a way .
a group of ankara that i met a little while ago , which is a student group who wanted to carry on the public , what they wanted to learn in college , and they &apos;ve been trying to explain little actions and try what d.n.a is .
and i have a lecture on the top of copenhagen in copenhagen in the medical museum in combination with a show .
and this is , yes , that &apos;s the most beautiful young people , but the only thing that all the united states is , is this fascination in the technology .
and what you can do with this , and you just start to look at society &apos;s society and ask questions , so , okay , what do you know what you want to join you with you ?
so , anonyk , now , to illustrate biology , takes some material .
you need , of course , biological materials , and you need tools , but it &apos;s also a lab .
in addition , what you normally understand under a laboratory , these are kind of broken machines , extremely expensive , extremely distance , only for professional goods , dedicated academics and so on .
and our approach was to say , okay , that actually you don &apos;t have to do that .
it &apos;s actually not necessary because every single coffee car has actually developed higher technology than most lab equipment , which is really .
and it &apos;s about this premise with this premise , for example , brian degger , in england , tried to put a minimality together , and then took a steam pressure , a heat plate , and , yeah , that &apos;s what bacteria grew up with .
so each one of which is already a soup of soup that he has left for too long , even before .
and then i tried to do this in my lab , a little bit , and then i would buy so clogged of equipment on ebay and made a little bit of d.n.analysis , trying to make a father test , so that &apos;s so / d.n.a fingerprint .
now , that should actually not be a joke .
down here in the picture , you &apos;re seeing the lab , in leadership , so it &apos;s such a garage with all kinds of lab , which has fallen out in college , a group in paris , which has a group in paris , which is what was established and pretty successfully , because i want to cut a project quickly .
and this is biorabbit , which also mentioned hacking space , this one , such a kind of citizen school in principle for molecular biology .
and yes , so , you see , it &apos;s relatively relatively heterogene , so there are people who are doing it alone , until they &apos;re too large , so much larger organizations that are going to do more generally .
but always always the idea that it should stop and be accessible .
the first project that we did as an international group , when we were kind of aware of ourselves , is there now as a real scene , and we are online , and we &apos;re so familiar with the people who are there and so on .
and then came from the self-care organic landscape of the founder , and he said , &quot; well , we &apos;ve got to really meet ourselves , even in real life , and then have two events organized in london , two thousand , and shortly in the united states , in san francisco .
and , you know , that &apos;s what it was about , yes , who are we , what do we want , what do we want to say ?
and what are our values and what are we our target , our foundation ?
and then we &apos;ve been working on a code-ut portal .
it was quite intuitive , so everybody has just his wishes , and what it would take , and what it would do , then , then .
there came , i think , a very good code done .
and what we did is , we &apos;re not compassionate , but that is , i think , it &apos;s pretty good , that people are quite convinced of this .
and we even tried to get back to the academic world , but there &apos;s somehow not that way .
so i think we &apos;re from the biohacking scene in terms of even further than the academic world .
yeah , what do we do now ?
a project that i did with the hacker network in switzerland , was that we wanted to build a so-called optical trap or optical alarm .
this is , if you focus a laser beam on a room , you can catch little particles in the air , or in the liquid and then move into this focus , so that &apos;s where it &apos;s captured , so it &apos;s like a tractor officer in principle .
this works really , it &apos;s done in academia , and then we thought , anonymous , we may have a webcam , and then we might have a webcam that &apos;s made up the lens , turning off the lens , then it turns out to be about four hundred times .
you see that down there .
and then we cut away a d.v.d burning and put the torner out the laser and then tries to focus on this camera .
and unfortunately , it didn &apos;t work , but we &apos;ve yet learned a lot .
so another project that looks like the french group out of paris , this is pretty cool .
and it &apos;s like , well , it &apos;s such a brain wave device , so e.t. or something , so he &apos;s involved with neurobiology , his nickname is sam neuroscientist .
he then came up with this helmet there , and in cooperation with the museum , it &apos;s gone .
and then the visitors in the room could go into this chair , sit on this chair .
then their brainwaves were measured , and depending on what they thought or how they thought , they &apos;re different lights in the room .
was a pretty good project .
another thing from the united states , which has just to do with this dad , is the p.c.r , which is polymerase-que response , complicated word .
so it &apos;s about copying genes , to reproduce , to collect d.n.a , so you can make it visible .
so when i do that now , if i do the profiler at the scene , then there will be any hair samples , and then they make this approach , and then they can say , okay , this hair belongs to these people .
and the machines that are doing something like this are pretty expensive that you buy , the cheapest go to four thousand euros .
and that &apos;s not in hobbyn , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that can also do a lot .
so this is just an application of many , which you can do with it .
and they have two of these two builders , and they said , okay , we &apos;re going to do that simple and cheaper , and then just open up open source , so open hardware , electrical things , electric sauce , this device , and now are the cheapest venues of the world .
i think somehow so hexshread dollars or something .
but anyway , it &apos;s still not cheap now , but it &apos;s definitely in a frame where it &apos;s very useful .
so i think it &apos;s a very fine hack .
a project i had recently started to build a gene gun .
gene gun is , yes , like a kind of air pressure that shoots about that far , two centimeters or something .
you charge d.n.a on gold particles and the gold particles into these air pressure , and then i put it up on the onion and then shot the light that way .
so the device you see there doesn &apos;t work .
but this is my prototype , which is my prototype , which has looked pretty much like this , so on a branch , the thing on it , with electronics and pressure , and it was the pressure to be broken up .
and then i took a string of the wheel and put it on it .
a sappy pender , if you make the full power with water , the amount of pressure , so i think that &apos;s four to six-legged bar .
and then you can accelerate the particles very strong enough , and then you go into the onion .
and the commercial device costs about five thousand euros upwards , or something like that , the 50 .
so it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically feasible .
and so that &apos;s also the core cause of the scene , to increase these availability of technology , and also the information and the ability to increase that more people can get involved there .
because , as at the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have pretty little idea of it , and also not a chance to form that .
because , if you just read about it , from visual literature , it &apos;s not the same as if you &apos;ve done it yourself or you saw it .
and i think technology is becoming more important in our modern societies .
and if you want to be able to make sense of an informed citizen in society , and you want to talk , then you need access to knowledge and technology .
and you have to do it and understand it and understand it .
and then the chairman of the box is open and citizen science .
so , you know , as citizens in the situation , you just put apart with these scientific technologies .
and this is the core cause of the biohacker .
these are the people who have at least officially launched on the website , d.i.y.bio-org website .
that &apos;s a relatively remarkable number of people around the world .
and what &apos;s interesting is that they are also in southeast asia .
that &apos;s me , i think , are less people there than actually exist .
so i know some people who don &apos;t have it .
and these are just biohacker , the individual people .
in part , with these hacking spaces , these places put together .
and that &apos;s in the beginning .
as i said , look at it first .
and hackerspaces , the computer hackerspaces , because the c-base in berlin was the first , nine-hundreths of three .
and this is now a giant network of very good , yes , infrastructural centers that are represented around the world .
and we hope , of course , that we &apos;ll be able to extend ourselves , and then we &apos;re kind of connected , so that there are more people involved in it .
and i would invite everybody to deal with it , and even whatever .
it &apos;s not so simple now , but it &apos;s not impossible , if you have enough curiosity , and there &apos;s enough energy in it , you get there too .
thank you for listening .
that &apos;s it .
yeah , hello .
how do we actually work ?
this is a question that is very moving to me as a designer , but also in the research area of usonia and all sorts of things in the field of users .
it &apos;s about how to meet people in interactive media so that they can use these interactive media and generate them a fairly satisfying experience .
because i think that the interactive media in our archaian , cognitive models address , so paradigm patterns have been programmed in our biological memory very , very long , and that we can restore the only through interactive media .
and this is very amazing , because you actually believe that these high-technology , which you &apos;ve seen , is that you actually get into the future , but actually it &apos;s so that the future is right at us , in our archaian roots .
now , what are now archaic models ?
i &apos;ve written four words , and i want to explain to you briefly .
it &apos;s the models of archaian cognitive models , and it &apos;s the models we &apos;ve made in the pre-industrial times .
to this archaian models , we heard that we have an basically natural ratio to virtual complexity .
that sounds rather unusual for this .
but i &apos;m going to go back to this , and i &apos;m going to prove to you by trying to find that you have a natural relationship in virtual history .
the second thing is that since this archaic models , we &apos;ve been able to talk about it in a very , very visual way , even though we use a coding language today .
and the third area , which explains actually itself .
we all know that the interactive media by definition are non-linear , which is the case of the linearity , and which of course tells us that we feel the linearity today .
the fourth point is that the history of information is a place of information .
now , how about the virtual crisis , which is actually the most natural thing in the world .
i want to show you that .
how many doors do the house have , where they live ?
we can &apos;t answer them immediately , but it &apos;s going to happen , and it &apos;s happening right now .
they go in the spirit through this house , in which they live , and look at how many doors there are .
and that &apos;s what they do .
it &apos;s virtual reality , and it &apos;s absolutely without computers .
fantastic , right ?
and that &apos;s where we give ourselves the media campus , for example , the virtual reality in our v.rs lab , so we can actually see the whole time .
and this wealth that the virtual reality of reality is to have the reality , the people in the industrial industrial times , because they had nothing .
they had no books .
or they didn &apos;t have a photolitography .
they had no mass media .
the only thing they had was their head .
and in this head , the memory was off .
in this head , you &apos;ve got to know , and using these virtual images , the imagination , they &apos;ve been passed on .
and therefore , it &apos;s so strong to us that we can deal with virtuality so well .
the interesting thing about it is , if i can make a little trip .
yeah , that &apos;s going on .
the interesting thing about this is that at that time the human being at the same time , the media producer and medium itself was .
now , if you keep thinking a little bit .
what are the media today ?
then you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s a change .
but i &apos;ll talk about that again .
the main tool of information training has been since jeval stories .
shaman , priests , called the knowledge of knowledge , were so empowered to keep knowledge in stories .
and today we &apos;re still very , very strong at stories .
the author of the &quot; the world &apos;s book , &quot; jonathan gotcheall , we still refused a hundred and a half miles a year with the challenge of stories .
this means for a child that &apos;s spent it to reach the most of the time of his life with the prescription of stories .
now we think our love of stories depends on stories that we sat on the lap of our parents .
no , no , far missing .
this is a lot further back to the cultures of the industrial times .
but for me , in the field of interactive media as a particularly impressive thing , we have that in our biological memory , the ability to think of the ability to think .
i brought to you an example from the north american tribe of the nootka indian .
and life lived in the coastal region of british columbia .
and as you can see , this is a very island area and you had to navigate there , from island to island to get food .
and they did this with so-called so-called lead-land cards .
you may also know , if you &apos;re interested in this , from the australian urmen .
they have similar principles .
they don &apos;t have lead-land cards , but they have used the kind of cornanals of sunny animals or traumatic .
and what &apos;s interesting about this is that the navigation and the topography of regions could be photographed by the songs .
which is the language that was understated by subposing .
that means you have navired about sounds and about rhythm .
and this sound and this rhythm have shown the geology , the topography of a region , which is , of course , that you could defer these songs and make it different to the left , and go back to the right place , to the right place .
why don &apos;t we sing more to come from the top to b ?
anyway , not to navigate .
what &apos;s actually happening ?
what happens is that this is the gene machine age .
we &apos;ve moved in what &apos;s called the votian age .
this is the machine age , and it &apos;s happening , and it &apos;s the book , and it &apos;s the photolitography .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens to us that we have the responsibility for our memories and the own production of our individual memories .
on the book , and on the picture .
so we unfortunately have god &apos;s play a bit more sophisticated .
virtual ality has become alien for us , and it has nothing to do with reality .
bruce brown , a famous design researcher on the brighton university , is so far to say that these mass media , he means the book and the image , so not television , the internet , and so on , what we call a mass of mass media today , and our ability to mobilize .
let &apos;s make a small interaltitude .
from the valley age to the machine age .
what has matters on our thinking and our minds ?
and then these are the assets of the pre-industrial cultures .
and they &apos;ve been signed over the centuries of centuries over the centuries of the machine age .
that means , instead of remembering ourselves , we have standardized , far shared patterns of memories that we can relate to our personal memories .
we don &apos;t produce ourselves anymore .
we have a abstract language language .
we don &apos;t think of the thing more in images that are not in pictures , but we &apos;re correcting them to our language .
we have used to think that things happen linear .
and we accepted the linearity as law and there are only exceptions , like the non-linearity .
what left us is the hirshhorn .
still , we &apos;re very , very arrested to the hirshhorn as information as we do .
the question is , what &apos;s next ?
we had the age age , we had this machine age , and we now describe the &quot; cyber age . &quot;
that sounds very smooth , and it sounds very big about science fiction , i know .
but these concepts of cyber age , which brings us back to these possibilities again .
it &apos;s virtual , it &apos;s about nonlinearity , it &apos;s about parkinson &apos;s .
i want to explain that for a minute .
there are technical concepts like this , for example , the augmented reality , which is the extended reality .
so if you look at google for example , then this is a concept that allows us to recombine the virtual world with the real world that means our monkeys , which is a virtual , natural , natural , natural , nature will come back again .
another example is this called virtual reality .
so this is , of course , in the context of my talk , because we &apos;re going to move physically into not existing , virtual worlds , all the way after the skyline model .
and another example is the ambient , intelligent systems .
these are spaces that can respond to a human being .
all this needs the ability to accept our basic ability to accept virtual habitat as a real habitat .
i graduated and i hope that the video works a very , very beautiful project , which is the zabork work of michael burk , joris comedy and jan-moritz trash and jan-moritz trash .
and the two are also here today .
maybe you can stand up for a long time , so that you can talk to the two about the project .
and this project i brought as an example of how back to this archaian , cognitive models .
the whole thing is a game , i have to say .
and of course , what &apos;s going on , and it &apos;s a computer game .
and if i say computer play , then you have very likely to think that any people are happy with some people who are happy or that they play with some of the animals in the hand .
anyway , they &apos;re doing it in that .
this is a game for outside .
and that &apos;s what i thought is , i think , to discover the doors of the world , so that i want to rediscover the real world again .
and this game connects the virtual world , so the data is the data that we produce with the real world .
i apologize that i have to cut so much off .
you can explain a lot better , because there &apos;s a lot more behind it .
and it &apos;s about being able to discover a city by looking at what &apos;s positive or negative in places .
and so i get a very different view of the city , a very different impression , which is that i see negative and positive zones of a city and i get this kind of , virtual map of a very real city .
and we like to look at this now .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is a little explanation of what you &apos;re looking at .
of course , this virtual world in the walls of our cities is clear .
and with a kind of pocket light , we can make these virtual worlds visible .
so , i just like to summarize my talk , and it &apos;s in the sense that the properties and the skills that we &apos;ve acquired from the von age , and we &apos;ve gone so a little bit out of the age of the &quot; cyber age , &quot; and we &apos;ve gone back to that kind of , and actually come back to our roots .
thank you .
yeah , i &apos;m very excited to be able to be with you .
i &apos;ve been wondering if this bag is there , and i &apos;m just talking about it .
it &apos;s not going to do it .
i &apos;m also going to resolve what &apos;s inside .
but i &apos;ve just done it a little bit curious yet .
yes , kids are from the nature of curious or should be curious , designers too .
i &apos;m from house of house , so , of course , i &apos;m involved with the subject of curiosity and how the curiosity changes our thinking , and why are we going to lose curiosity and why we have to repel curiosity and so on .
this is a whole series of things that you &apos;re looking at next to the actual experience of print .
if professors are curious , they &apos;re often going in like this in the &apos; 50s .
and that &apos;s what i had last half a year .
a research ceremony for natural users interface .
now you &apos;re going to ask , why are all the windows going to start with such natural , archaic heritage of communication , interaction and so on .
and there i &apos;m just one of these little devices , because the things that are supposed to be more intuitive , more and more and more , are becoming more compassionate , and you have to look at what is natural for us , of course , what is user friendly or intuitively .
and before the background , i found myself in the realm of natural users interface , so the next generation in relation to human computers in the relationship of the human computers , so in the relationship of the human or how the computer is changing from the computer .
so i &apos;ve been doing it , of course , when , of course , or intuitively .
you may have a glimpse of it again .
why does that happen ?
so if we look at the development of our society , here soon , we &apos;re moving from the third social generation or social form .
so from modern computer society .
every society is shaped by a primary medium .
at the beginning , the tribal society through language .
that means you &apos;ve found that you talked to a common language , you could communicate with each other , in the same cave , or in other areas , cities have been created , or in other places , in cities , or villages of this .
but the primary medium was the language , something very natural , something very natural .
it was also learning that you had to learn , so not a child can talk about nature , but we &apos;re learning it , of course , sukene and discourse .
and that was solved by the ancient society and the first form of abstraction .
this was a huge scream at the time , because of course you started to manifest the living language in the form of writing , which is what liquid and alive is , and i put it in stone and so i can prove it .
depending on how i chel and when i shoot it , of course , it &apos;s a very different narrative when there &apos;s a way of living .
but sukzzel came up with this script as primary media , and he came up with it .
then the next generation , in which we actually live in primary life today .
this is just through pressure and print writing with a mountain mountain and others .
in the same time , it was just an affcher , where adel , rusty and other people said , &quot; you &apos;re really insane when people start reading , then they want to talk to them afterwards , and of course , that &apos;s totally embarrassing .
and now we come to the next generation , and the exciting thing is that it &apos;s just all the few hundred years , and we &apos;re actually in this phenomenal phase , that we &apos;re going to do this .
that confused us , of course , because we see the new media , social social media , facebook and so on .
with the total transparency , what the new thinking is , what &apos;s the old thinking , don &apos;t say that in the cragne horse , it &apos;s no more beef , or no beef , or other phenomena , which i just want to do .
and these two worlds just close to each other , new and old thinking .
so the exciting thing about this is , if you look at this , this new society , this computer society , has been rejected very many , many principles , principles and archaic thinking patterns from the tribal society .
now , no longer on the local level , but on global level .
we understood that the weather is global .
that the theme of ecology is a global .
not if i think locally green and the neighbor thinks less ecologically , then it doesn &apos;t work .
that means that from local village is actually a global village with the same principles , of course , equally intuitive , but also the total transparency .
as you knew at the time in the village who has what was with who and when it happens today , this extension of our self through these mobile devices is on global level .
whether we know that we know global clusters and faster faster and faster .
as soon as it was going on on the village .
before the background , i &apos;m just looking at what &apos;s called it , which is , of course , what we might have , of course , what we may have , but also , what is the difference ?
because often people come , they can &apos;t make it friendly , so everyone can deal with it .
so you have to deal with what &apos;s called the , and not just easy that it &apos;s different , but it should be better .
and of course , when , of course , there &apos;s something intuitive and how i can take advantage of it , and just look for things like that , that they &apos;re a user friendly , so they &apos;re very intuitive , because then they &apos;re fun and just use .
and then you &apos;re working on the study of perception , with the theme of perception and the perceptual system .
and that , of course , is also what you &apos;re starting to do and look and say , okay , now i just look inside the inner self .
and what does it actually look like in there ?
so how do we work when we look inside there ?
and what does really mean , of course , intuitively and how do we work our channels of perception and how it works ?
because steve jobs have said to you , you know , you have to be a stranger .
so you really have to look at the detail when i want to make a little bit of user friendly or intuitive , which means that in the core .
and there &apos;s already that you can see a group of our seven senses that most people think we have only five , since they &apos;re actually seven , there &apos;s certainly seven , there &apos;s probably the next , eight sense of it , and as an extension of our self .
and to see , how do we process information , how do we take information ?
to say , what is information ?
information is every difference that makes a difference .
many use the word , you know , not what it means .
but i have to understand in the core , in the essence , when it becomes information to information , when the data comes from data and information , so i know how i can make things even more intuitive or of course , of course .
and of course , how take design impact on perception .
and what we see here is , when i make things , i can make them confusing like on the right , where i don &apos;t know what &apos;s salt and pepper , or i can sort of make it intuitive by showing things .
so a lot of natural , much , in a vessel , but i look directly at where salt is and pepper .
and when i say someone , give me salt or pepper , then he will think about the right , where is it in it ?
and on the left , just intuitive , and then hopefully i hope that no sugar is in the middle of it .
but also our perception itself , how does it deceive us .
for example , this perception in context .
the right circle looks bigger than the small , even though it &apos;s not the case , but they &apos;re just just the same way , and yet our perception changes after what we put things in .
anybody know what that is ?
come on .
cesmation should work .
there &apos;s going to be more to my glasses .
so it &apos;s &apos; n circle .
a second circle begins to correlate certain similarity or associate .
and when i stop putting another halval on it , you &apos;re not going to see a unit , which is a circle , circle and , but we see a unit , we don &apos;t see a circle , a circle , a circle , another .
this is what you call a design law , or you can see psychology that affects us again in perception .
important for the print , the most frequently in the first semester , the great law laws .
the law of the competition near the continuity and so forth .
and i often forget back in the third one .
but this is a food component , if you want to design things very carefully as well .
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting , is the vision of vision .
sounds very banal for the first time , but it &apos;s so exciting if you &apos;re getting closer .
so we have the eyes , and now you think we see from the back to the back .
that &apos;s wrong .
you look at the front of the back .
because they &apos;re proring to the front that they &apos;re seeing something they recognize , unprecedented circle .
that means we &apos;re just looking at our vision before we see it , bringing it back back to the back of our system , to say , okay , okay .
so i &apos;ve got this cognitive retreat back , you &apos;ve got what you want .
it &apos;s also there , which then comes back .
then we go back to the front , because the back of the tree doesn &apos;t go and say , now , look at the front and i &apos;m sure it &apos;s really , you know , what you want to see .
and then it goes back to back and then it &apos;s going to be .
so a very , very exciting process , how certain things happen , and in what for milliseconds , these things happen .
i don &apos;t know who you know this picture .
it &apos;s exactly the same thing that i just described .
now everybody &apos;s trying to recognize this pattern .
i don &apos;t know who you see .
does somebody see something else ?
a dalmatiner , right .
if i saw that that there &apos;s a dalmatiner inside , you know .
you &apos;ll never forget it more , because i &apos;ll show you where the dalmatiner is .
now you see the dalmatiner .
and further , you see it always .
that is , i actually put it down right now that you don &apos;t see any patterns in it , but i &apos;ve done it in a very short time , to see this dog in the blink of the picture .
and this is the projection of vision , feedback , feedback .
now i know it , and now i &apos;m proposing that i see the dalmatiner .
i see the dalmatiner .
so , very exciting processes , which then in this , yes , gray is actually not , but here in this rosanen mass , just just close to this .
does anybody know what three seconds are ?
long , yes .
that &apos;s our present .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as designers .
if i know something takes three seconds , until i kind of get out of the present loop in the past , i can also have a very good job ever , in which i do it by doing somebody with three seconds .
it has to process it as a presence .
and then it goes into the past , and so i can get very elegant waiting for example of the computer when i know this phenomenon .
what &apos;s the equivalent of 20 milliseconds ?
yeah , milliseconds .
it &apos;s also a very exciting phenomenon .
this is the time where you &apos;re in love .
what that means is , if you know that now , look at who you look at how long you can see , because i &apos;m not going to take a school for what &apos;s going on .
and six milliseconds , also a very exciting phenomenon .
this is the time of most of the perceptions we have .
that means this first impression happens in a rasant fast speed , as we perceive things .
and as we see things , what we &apos;re looking at and how we kind of make ourselves on our environment , so we can think about it .
of course , it &apos;s not just to deal with the issue of perceptions and neural processing or cognitive processing , but primarily with the subject of human-objective relationship .
so how does a human deal approach things ?
there &apos;s a product language , which is practical functions , so kind of formal aspects or formaesthetic aspects .
there &apos;s a bond , where i know exactly where i &apos;ve got to reach .
but there &apos;s also symbolic functions , why is there a little bit of a little bit of , where does it hardly fit at any time , so horror of money , even though it &apos;s not so precious ?
we &apos;re more likely to be on the symbolic , which is what we &apos;re doing , of course , as a wave age .
back to my real topic of natural users interface , and the subject , which is , of course , uepness , is ustrand .
uszon means the way i can get a certain amount of goal , or how to get an users in a certain fashion context , effectively efficient and dangerous a goal .
that &apos;s more like the norm .
how do i make something more important ?
i can use that directly , or i need &quot; n handbook , &quot; or i need to do this .
and less rabbits or user friendly is it .
that i just make this different and beautiful , doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s better handable .
you also have to understand that .
and then , if you look at the software that we just saw , you &apos;re going to understand why ninety-nine percent of our modern software is very intuitive or not at any level , which is in many parts of the software , including reading it , even though it &apos;s more intuitive than classical software .
and this is intuitive users not only have a fundamental economic factor for the most elementary economic factor , of most elementary success , when i just want to make technology use to people .
why ?
because in the rule of using this new type of use , the natural user is íting , for example , five times faster in the average of our goal .
you have to imagine that if you make some of the classical sods , five hours , and with this new kind of natural software , just an hour .
that doesn &apos;t mean you can probably go home four hours to go home , but your employer or somebody will fall , you know , how it works with the four hours .
but i want to say that , of course , it &apos;s a leading increase for us , as well .
so when we go back to the software , here &apos;s the first blockline of interfaces that were very abstract , where you needed months to deal with these systems .
and then the next , the next thing that we &apos;ve been dealing with with &quot; is &quot; neural neural model , or mental model like software eergonics , &quot; which is , you know , have an idea of something that is metaphor , the metaphor of a desktop to make the computer useful .
so no longer zeroes and ones or claws , but just a metaphor .
so that made a lot more significant , but it &apos;s also a lot better .
the next generation of graphic users is working very much more with behavior .
so there i am a lot more often the behavior as a wave .
this is also a paradigm shift .
that i think it &apos;s always unimportant to the success of success , which is just an app .
and when i go further into this natural user user interface , where i am by voice , by language , per touch , by the gesture and not a mouse and a mouse , i &apos;m not going to have to drive the things , i &apos;m more quickly and more immediate .
but that leads me to the point again , when are things going to be more intuitive ?
if you &apos;re more intuitive , and then i have to put my little friend out of here and see what does that mean , because of the view of cognition , when is it really intuitive now ?
and this is always a little bit intuitive for us to think of when i have to think about it as little .
so it seems that he doesn &apos;t seem to think , but it just makes a difference .
the less i kind of think about it , the more intuitive it is .
and what does that mean for the designers ?
that means that if we look at existing computing models of one on something else , for example , the metaphor , then i can use that as an age .
that means i can put this sort of intuitive , human model on a software and make it much more important to the software .
now , of course , the question is , what is the most intuitive feature of human beings and now i &apos;ve been calling it .
this is what &apos;s called the visceral model .
this is using each of us and the ozone is an aconym and stands for guidance , selective , transbreaks .
that makes each one of you all the time , but it &apos;s an unconsciously kind of intuitive or yes , or something very intuitive .
the model is already going to be in the womb and is culturally cultural , so it works in the world with young and old , and it &apos;s used by us all the time without the fact that this model is present .
it &apos;s about 50 to 80 thousand times each of us ever after activity , so you &apos;ve noticed that it &apos;s going to be less often more often than the day .
i can now implement this mental model , selective , transfers , transbreaks on a interaction system .
and through this kind of transmission , similar way with the metaphor of the despipe , now not a metaphor of a physical object , but it &apos;s not a metaphor of a physical object , one of the gloves .
and this is on a higher degree of the user kindness as the transmission of a classical metaphor , which is the discord .
and now , if i overwear that , for example , in which i &apos;m more engaged than overlooking , as a choice , in the case , it comes up to me , i can look at it in detail , and yes , it &apos;s called , i can throw it somewhere or buy somebody or buy it , and so on .
then i can transmit the whole thing .
i &apos;m trying to do this by an unprecedented .
yeah , everyone has eaten a cake .
overlooking : now i &apos;m interacting with the object , again , zoom back .
i &apos;m going to get all the reference , now , to filter up , and can say , let me just show all of you about chocolate for example .
and once in a while , i have an interface which is significantly more intuitive and very much natural .
because , you know , i can reach the pieces like the bits , touch , and they come to me , it &apos;s much natural than if you can do it across hierarchical websites or other mechanisms .
imagination is more rabbits than mind-wandering , and i want to end with this sentence , a and again , to give you a hint , also designers have to think differently about new solutions , and in this sense , thank you very much for your attention and please .
i want to help you a very specific aspect of curiosity .
the first one , when you become a child as a child , as a baby , is that you take care of the divorce that you have , yes ? and depending on whether your parents have allowed you to play more or less in the pottery of your mouth , the more , of course , it &apos;s going to paint your curiosity .
and curiosity doesn &apos;t get learning .
and that &apos;s all the ones that are here and curious , actually people who have a property that you can &apos;t learn .
i &apos;m going to talk to you now , basically all this environmental debate , global set , four years of club , in quality .
and there &apos;s a central point here .
and that depends on phosphorus .
give a chance .
every day , they give them plywood to about two grams phosphorus , and every day you have to take two grams phosphorus .
otherwise they can &apos;t have teeth .
they can &apos;t store energy .
you can &apos;t have bone .
we could cover only as a one-way mollusk through the oceans .
if we did not get a phosphorus and make it .
astonishingly , we &apos;re so concerned that we &apos;re here with something , which was actually self-replication , but not that way .
because everyone talks about energy , but nobody talks about the phosphorus problem .
the phosphorus problem is much more critical .
we depend on two countries .
we only have for two years of phosphorus , and already now by the phosphorus mining , much more uranium in the environment , when it &apos;s used in all nuclear facilities .
in the last 20 years alone , five thousand tons of uranium are distributed to our fields in germany .
and that &apos;s what we take .
it makes leukemia in children .
and we think we would protect the environment if we &apos;re a little less harmful .
so , for example , the environment , push less car .
the environment , make less waste .
and the environment , they need less energy .
it &apos;s not protection .
this is like if i would say , pop your child , it just drops three times .
it &apos;s just a little bit less destruction .
if we think of the way to the bage , then our whole earth used to be a peaceful station or later .
that &apos;s why to think about it .
and the most important thing is to look at the ground as the first .
in the ground , over six percent of the carbon dioxide is stored .
right now , we &apos;re building corn and losing between 11 kilograms of food tons per hect0-pound , or on the square square meter .
that means we lose about five times more than being reformed .
so , of course , we can look at the waste problem .
and everything is packaging or content .
in touch , for example , at home are 20 percent of the waste of garbage now .
and because we get older , the wind gets bigger .
it &apos;s kind of like all of you in the suburbs .
yes ?
a baby needs about six or behold wind .
we could reduce that , of course , about 10 percent , but what does that do ?
this will be balanced in china for a second .
this is completely trivial .
so the question is , how do we deal with this wind ?
and one of the evidence , by the way , is that men are not pigs .
i want to tell you .
because the phosphorus is attracted to the solid components .
people over the urine .
yeah .
so they can &apos;t be pigs .
because that &apos;s actually what it shows , right ?
traditionally , we think in the environmental debate , we &apos;re too much on the world .
and if you &apos;re talking to people if you &apos;re talking to people , if you &apos;re talking to people , that would be better , you &apos;re not going to be there , you &apos;re going to be qualified and sweet .
and so someone like al gore says , one of our great heroes , there &apos;s nothing more important than stabilize human population .
in israel , you say , if you rescue a human life , you save the earth .
here &apos;s what the more you are bringing around , the better .
yeah .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
if you look at the ants , the weight of the ants on earth , then the ants weigh about four times more than we humans .
i could also take a termites , but in the united states , nobody likes termites , so far , even though they &apos;re vegetarian .
that means the ants weigh a lot more than we do .
and because they work much tougher than we do and because they live only three to six months , they &apos;re in their weight , in the energy consumption , something 30 billion people .
that means we &apos;re not too many , we &apos;re too stupid , right ?
and where you &apos;re looking away from what we really wanted to do , and we could , and how sad we are that we are at all , you can see that , for example , in the earth , we have a program to see that it has a program to be neutral , right ?
you can only be wet , if you don &apos;t exist , right ?
the only chance .
have you seen a carbon-neutral tree ?
yes ?
one ?
that means our whole intelligence means that we want to be stupid than the trees , right ?
yes ?
no tree is carbon neutral .
luckily , right ?
there &apos;s no over-population problem .
there are still six hundred trees in the amazon in the amazon .
you &apos;ve heard of it a little bit overpopulation problem of trees ?
that means all of our intelligence means that we want to be stupid than the trees .
and where you see , even something like demeter , the most strikest bio-- agriculture , doesn &apos;t allow our own metabolic products to go back .
every year we lose so three million tons of phosphorus , which would have to go back in circular .
and we &apos;re too many .
just about it .
that &apos;s what we feel so guilty about the earth , that we say , there &apos;s no bio-land , no organic , no creation avenue , and how they all are , that allow our creation to go back .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
so we are too many .
it &apos;s certainly useful to be less harmful , in terms of oil consumption .
but where are we useful ?
we &apos;re trying to minimize our ecological footprint , but it &apos;s about having a large footprint that is useful .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but if it comes to the environment , it &apos;s the highest , not being , yes ?
nullemissions , yes ?
you can only have nullemissions when you &apos;re not there .
even when they shoot themselves , they would have emissions .
so you can &apos;t solve that .
we can do it differently .
we can extract our nutrients back .
we do agriculture in brazil from where we extract nutrients back .
very directly , we can get back to that kind of nutrients in agriculture .
for example , we do this in china , for example , where we take the end of it .
in china , this is one more anonymous today in china , so you can see , right ?
and in our western world , we were always too stupid to bring our nutrients back .
that means the whole western civilizao story is that the city has always taken , but never gave the farmers back .
by doing that , the cities used to grow more , because the farmers were going to the cities , and the cities always had to go away their nutrients .
all of the western empire is always expanding , until you haven &apos;t done the infrastructure , and then you &apos;re immune .
yes ?
in china , it was different .
you &apos;ve been able to handle civilization over five years because you &apos;ve always been able to bring nutrients back .
even today , if you &apos;re invited to dinner in china , you expect to be the food that you &apos;re going to stay in until you &apos;re looking for the toilet .
because it &apos;s unfriendly to go and increase nutrients .
you &apos;ve got them to eat them , not for food theft .
that means you can see in the internet , you can get the nutrients back .
actually , the beautiful thing is , if you do that , so agriculture is creating biogas , on a square country with five people in favelas , can make a farmer about a hundred and a half foot economy , and the plant is going to grow the chickens and the bucks and vegetables and fish and fish .
and the great thing is that the crime rate is back in the favelas around 300 percent .
so we don &apos;t need to control people , as little as we are .
we can support them , to be good .
this is of course high-tech agriculture , but the plants carry themselves .
the side product is clean water .
and they &apos;re so designed by design that can just raise a farmer .
that means to go back to the criminals .
and none of these facilities , we &apos;ve now built over a hundred percent in the last 20 years , none of these facilities has ever been resolved .
they could easily throw a liter of algae , and then the plant would be ruined over years .
don &apos;t happen instead .
that means we don &apos;t need to control people , as little as we are .
we can support them , to be good .
that means we need to get phosphorus back .
and by the way , if you want to do what you want to do it , in germany , it &apos;s best for all of the rest of it in france .
unfortunately , not in touch , but maybe you can help a little bit of help in the southwest .
because the frankdian facility could get the phosphorus back .
and it has to go back .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
and we see that it can be done .
we &apos;ve been using it over three years now .
the dutch government has explained you &apos;re going to be the first country in the world , which is phosphorus .
but we need this overall .
you know , there are two countries that control almost 80 percent of the phosphorus in the world .
there &apos;s opec a bunch of orphanages .
these are six countries that control four percent of the oil supplies .
and the oil will replace us through other energy systems .
but the phosphorus will not replace .
that &apos;s not about making the existing a bit less bad , but it &apos;s about making something right .
and it &apos;s especially for questions about what the right thing is .
that means it &apos;s about efficiency , not about efficiency .
in holland , you understand , of course , because in holland , the country is built on flowers .
yes ?
imagine if your wife &apos;s sad , for example , if you &apos;ve got it , and you come with 50 roses .
completely inefficient .
but very , very effectively , yes ?
or take a pen pen .
a woman in germany eats about six thousand pounds of their life .
so .
this isn &apos;t very scientifically accurate , because we don &apos;t know how much away it is .
but a liw pen , even at this lighting , i can tell you , is completely inefficient , but at all , right ?
one thing that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
that &apos;s not the resource efficiency , but efficiency efficiency .
to ask , what is the right ?
not to burn a little bit better , and put it into it , and to lose it and lose it all the materials for circular levels , but first of all , how do you divide in orbit ?
imagine mozart efficient .
yes ?
if i invite you to dinner and say , yes , there &apos;s a pill with open flaps and a glass of water .
wonderful , right ?
that &apos;s efficient .
everything in life is not efficient .
if you fall in love with somebody , efficient ?
yes ?
that means everything that counts in life is not about saving , to reduce .
all the environmental debate .
we tell people , oh yes , you don &apos;t have an environmental awareness in the south .
no , the throw away is exactly the right thing , right ?
at every point , where you throw away from , yes , you can get back to life .
but the wrong things .
if you throw the wrong things away , you have a waste problem .
as we think from north .
there &apos;s every foot print .
if you walk , yes , everybody destroyed the floor .
because the bottom is going to die the mosse , and the wind and the water and the water goes away .
but if you &apos;re in italy , everybody means footprint , that the water remains longer in the meadow .
so , it &apos;s about creating a large footprint that becomes a wetlands .
not school management .
we say in germany .
yes ?
but if i ask you how to do it with your wife ?
so what do you say ?
sustainable .
and then i say , heart torture , yeah ?
that &apos;s just the minimum .
so not saving , free , avoid .
each waste is nutrient .
and it &apos;s an lust , if you look in italy , like people in the high bow of the colacan out of the car .
because you know , that &apos;s a fun process .
it &apos;s a form of rejuvenation , right ?
you can show , i was there .
but with the right design , please .
so , for example , we &apos;ve developed a sheet of ice , which is in space temperature .
they can take away where they go and stand .
in two hours , they build all over .
and it contains seeds of rare plants so that they can contribute to biodiversity .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
so it &apos;s two circular cycles .
not all of them is supposed to be different .
a television or a washing machine that uses you just to use it .
just the things that smile , like shoe soles , like brazharan , how cars have to be so that they go to biological systems .
things that are only used are going into technical systems .
but today we &apos;re only talking about the biological systems .
yes ?
for example , the sneaker , yes ?
very direct advertising , not for the company &apos;s company , but that they &apos;re now helping this company to make these products successfully .
because we don &apos;t do things more freely .
yes ?
so , if i invite you to eat and say , it &apos;s free , it doesn &apos;t help you .
no , we find what &apos;s inside .
positive .
so not like detox .
not toxic in it .
it &apos;s all useful in it . it &apos;s useful .
these are the first shoes that you can put down the cavaliental launch on the pedestrian path , and the rubber in biological orbit can go , yes ?
all of it is weird .
and when it comes to us , of course , it will be , of course , for nike , for dean , for hennes and the whole text industry .
and that &apos;s half of all the water problems worldwide , which are caused by the texture industry .
that &apos;s why it helps you to ask questions about people .
hey , puma , is you really serious ?
because they &apos;ve already got twice the principal &apos;s head .
and i &apos;m not sure if you really leave .
so , help me a little bit .
but it &apos;s .
yeah .
that &apos;s what &apos;s been shown .
that &apos;s going on .
we can do things like this now , that if they smile , if they get broken , they can submerch in biological orbit .
now , technical degradation is the same .
there &apos;s a direct return system for this .
this is the first green backpack , actually , to go back in the circulation .
so , in every store , you can get things back .
if you come to that , yes ?
do you remember the windmill again ?
when the waste is right now .
all around these wind lines are around , almost .
in the countries where people come to money .
on top of the south pole , but also in the landscape , yes ?
if we change the plastic , so it can go into biological systems , if we change the water , inside that you can just go back to cellulose , you can plant with a baby in israel , or in tunisia , 100 percent trees .
yes ?
if you take these winpers , they destroy them , sterile and the powder to plant trees .
so that &apos;s the baby carbon positive for the whole life , from beginning .
so , we don &apos;t need to be neutral , we can be climate positive .
it &apos;s sort of a prestige operation .
yeah , so .
yes ?
we can do that .
we can reinvent everything even again .
i started an institute .
now there are many people working with them and they can all be engaged .
there &apos;s extra one to get cradl to cradl , where everybody can join .
so no longer save , free , avoid , no school management , but intelligent waste .
does that curious ?
thank you .
the work of the interpreted .
music as a language .
in the description of my talk , i said that as a symbol , i was writing as a magician , so in the english lexicon , i understand .
interpreted is the written notes in clinical music .
that as a translator , you don &apos;t just have to put word for the text in a different language , but also the deeper sense of the words and the word of words , so that it has to make a meaningful translation , you know , to do it with strangeness .
in fact , from german to english , more knowledge can require more knowledge when you &apos;re going to do it , if you &apos;re about poetry .
but it &apos;s very alien for salmon , which we do with musicians with our music language .
as a result of a music club , i first have the written notes .
you think , you know , the composer are written in the notes exactly everything he imagined .
in fact , the notes are very vague and unaccurate .
these notes are about the same , or not exactly , like a verbal , and also very seemingly appropriate , description of a landscape .
because in this verbal land of land , the smell of flowers is not to smell the flowers , the level of the green just to be able to hear the seuses of the windmill not to feel .
that means the interpreting needs to be in a different way , which is , listen , concrete , non-verbal music language .
today , i want to share with you what else i &apos;m doing , so the animals behave in a verbal language .
so basically , a translation of translation .
that &apos;s why i prefer to do the whole thing on german , because if i had to translate it into english , it would be equally significant for me to translate .
so , the music works for me as much as the spoken language .
the note notes have the function of the letter of a writing .
so it &apos;s not enough to read , just to read notes and get the answers to the piano or the right place on a violin string .
because that &apos;s just the letters you &apos;ve learned to paint .
the point of letters is you can only see if you can do the language .
so , for the learning process of music , the music needs at least as long as the spoken language .
and then there &apos;s too much , if you learn to do it , just passive understands , or you can talk to you , until the musical language language language .
the work of the interpreted starts similar to how one theater director .
after first of all , you &apos;ve chosen a piece of play , because you &apos;re excited about , you know , exploration for the beginning of the discovery .
you collect information about the piece in your visual literature .
you read in the letters , taessers , notes , or whether there are words , thoughts of composers themselves .
you study the works that he used to write before .
you compare comparison .
the reasons to write it .
how and what did he find ?
how did his lives occur , like the society and the politics ?
all interest me .
you think of yourself in this time by looking at contemporary images , for example , or reading literature .
now , with the time you have a real knowledge , you also have a very rich knowledge to the composers that you &apos;re playing , and it will always be easier to think and feel in it .
the composer is always going to be more and more the friend that you live with .
his cause to write the piece is always more and more and more my personal concerns , to play it .
now , there &apos;s all the notes as an accurate record of the composer , but only one framework , i &apos;m going to turn it back to this framework to make it sense and meaning meaning .
i then say to my own words , which could be written between this framework .
i play what these notes might mean .
now for me and for the composers then , and what they could now mean for him .
every tone , every phrase , gets a sense , because i feel it myself because it comes out of my personal language .
it has to be in here , and now i can &apos;t convince my audiences that this is my cause .
it &apos;s always a very happy concert , if i have to have the experience , that i &apos;ve done so long in advance of how to experience .
as you re-experienced a happy new day , even though with the same ritual of life , you get up , early pieces , you go to work , so on , i &apos;ll go back to the new .
i got older one day , the seasons , my pulse goes slower at night when the morning , in a concert hall , it takes longer that the sound comes back as home .
i &apos;m taking the breath of the audience , consciously , or unconscious .
all of that influenced me and all of this also influenced my experience with the composition .
quite wonderful , if i stand with a duo-mate on the stage , and we have the same wavelength .
then the same thing happens in a good set of entertainment .
you get a new idea in it , and it &apos;s going to answer that answers with a reaction .
it &apos;s exciting , because then things happen to us that we don &apos;t have , and what you can &apos;t do as well .
it makes great fun to do this kind of music , and then you &apos;ve experienced it as the audience communicates alive .
so every concert is a different concert .
i &apos;m never going to play more like this .
i can &apos;t play this way in 20 years today .
because i &apos;m going to have more life experience than today and i &apos;m going to have a lot more color in my palette of music , to emotions and emotion as today .
sure , i &apos;m also going to have a couple of colors of paint , but for doing new ones .
have a nice example of that .
it was on a piano plate for music students in my beloved old teacher , professor jyene ude , a known beethoven vender , concert gates and slow professor of music here in stuttgart .
unfortunately , i was a lot to be young , so that he was more disqualified than i finally started studying .
but i had the great fortune , it was very early with three years to meet , and i &apos;ve been at my high school time .
i was at the time when i went back to one of his courses and played the last of the four balshop of chopin , a little bit later .
he asked me what this ballet was for me .
that &apos;s such a training part .
and in my youth , i said , expectation .
there he goes , and he said , okay ?
that has to be difference .
because for me it means memory .
he was already about six .
well , at the age of 10 , you just have dreams , but no major memories .
i &apos;ll play the piece of every few years , and it has changed for me , although not a single note has changed .
every time it &apos;s exciting , i &apos;ll always read something new again .
one example of this is a whole different area . monet has painted the mermaid times .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but at different daytime , in different light .
he translated the seerotic shifts , as he saw it , as he saw it in this moment .
his personal impressions of the seerotic .
the x-line interpretation of a piece it &apos;s like this .
now i &apos;m also also older than chopin , when he wrote the piece .
he lived only 300 years .
and it &apos;s important to look back into the notes , even when i mean , you can adjust it .
to keep the twin , right with composers .
because the notes are the only connection to him directly .
especially if he died already .
now , how do you start talking about the language of music ?
i said yes , you need something like that for about the spoken language .
often the music class is that you learn to read the notes .
you learn the first thing to read before you just talk one word .
you learn to find the notes on the instrument .
if all of the fingers in time and so much like it is in the notes , they come , they come out , they sound like music .
when the error is happening , the student gets the next difficult piece of the picture .
i &apos;m not talking about interpretation in the first place .
well , all right , then this is a fast piece .
lento , slowly .
and if you look , you can see , and b and b , etc .
you know the most here .
but even if you put this angle , it &apos;s still just a technical technology .
and it &apos;s still not a interpretation .
i wonder .
i wonder that you often eat something very basic .
because , in order to make music on the instrument , your musical and feeling should be there before .
that &apos;s the singing .
a child that doesn &apos;t learn how to sing it , because the parents didn &apos;t make it happen by themselves .
it &apos;s like learning learning .
it &apos;s necessary to have its own experiences and the idea of music to get it through another possibility , so to make it sound on an instrument .
people who have never imagined , they never felt immediate with their own bodies , as it is to form a tone .
a phrase to design with its own breath .
the musicians , however , is the extension of our body .
our vocal prints to sing , our hands and feet to dance .
so , the hammerheads in the piano are the sequel of my fingers .
the melody comes from the real-time and the rhythm from the dance .
the continlation of music today is not involved .
you don &apos;t need to do any music if it &apos;s going to be boring .
no longer required to whistle a lovers or singing .
each of your own music is made a plate , if you &apos;re in the outside with music .
sure , there are some of you who say , yes , but what do you do when i can &apos;t sing ?
the question i can &apos;t sing you , a , because you think you can &apos;t sing ?
or b , because they didn &apos;t learn to sing ?
in both of them , it &apos;s not too late to begin to figure out whether you can &apos;t , or learn to learn how to put these little muscles , the vocal prints , right ?
because you can train .
or c , because you &apos;ve told them that they &apos;re undeaf .
i &apos;m asking , how much was the skills that this diagnosis was ?
do you have a second or a third opinion , how to say it now ?
or d , you don &apos;t like music , and you want to have nix to do so .
but then what i &apos;d like to do , because music is a beautiful , hands-on thing .
but maybe you can also change them .
well , you see , you don &apos;t have to be on all the cases , nobody needs to be out of noise .
but also , please don &apos;t say , i don &apos;t understand the classical music .
i can &apos;t say whether it &apos;s good or bad .
i said , well , i can tell you , but i can tell you if it doesn &apos;t like you .
because i don &apos;t think it says somebody , i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s me , because i can &apos;t cook .
so , they don &apos;t pay for food , just because they can &apos;t cook .
so you don &apos;t have to get rid of classical music , because you don &apos;t play an instrument .
listen to them and say whether it tastes to you or not .
whether the music is to be enthusiastic or too sweet .
say what they feel .
at the time , you also get spray and you want a little bit more spins there , or taste even fine differences .
now why do i challenge from my audience that it also is active ?
because the music is a language and a language is to communicate .
a piece of artwork you never look at has no force to work .
the food that was cooked by a chef chef or a chef has got to be eaten , and not just looked at recipes or recipes .
so please listen , if a music is played .
it &apos;s not just a nice sound paper .
if in an environment , where the adults are active , or at least they hear music , a child growing up , it &apos;s easy for a music teacher to ask , what color has your flower ?
now can you play it in blue ?
and the child is playing after a memorial , rather than a red flower .
and this sounds very different than this .
and that was the very first start of a musical expression .
so the first step to a interpretation .
and what happens when you &apos;re playing a piece today that has been written by a hundred hundred , two hundred or a half years ago ?
now the instruments are evolving .
there was no piano in time than an instrument yet .
it wasn &apos;t just invented .
i think that the bach would have been excited if he would have had the sound possibilities of the modern compass .
i can see the sound of sound today that would have the stream on the modern wing to sound what a barolic cembalo can &apos;t do .
also from beethoven , you know that he heard more than he had already gotten deaf .
today , a modern orchestra in the situation is able to play everything that a orchestra has predicted at the time .
that &apos;s why composers are responding to us , which are recreating the pieces again .
so they &apos;re going to listen to what they &apos;ve just thought of in the spirit .
and also , what they would think of today in the spirit .
or , what i &apos;m thinking about today is what they might have thought .
thank you .
do you know what envy is ?
have you ever been humble ?
and how did that feel ?
suck .
i have a friend who drives a passerati .
when i come up with my little v batesel and i get out of it , this feeling comes on .
i &apos;ll shoot something through my head .
i say , ultra-f , what do you need a big car ?
it &apos;s already about half the value of its value .
and at all , you work a lot less than i am .
why do i have to afford a little car ?
and then immediately , i &apos;ll say that &apos;s uneasy .
it &apos;s against justice .
and as i say the word justice , this unpleasant feeling is gone .
our organism has invented a great way to get these inpleasant feelings like envy just to disappear .
you can also try this with words like revenge or profit or whatever .
i want to tell you a little bit about this mechanism today , or something that &apos;s likely to be unconscious to you .
the mechanism comes from lying .
but don &apos;t think of the lie as you may have heard , if people say , no one has the intention to build a wall .
and then hit rocks so that he &apos;s beaten up the vision .
in such a lie , you see that the liars don &apos;t believe what he says .
it makes it easy to verify that it &apos;s completely different .
it just smells you and not yourself .
no , the lie i &apos;m talking about , which has to do with it , that you deceive yourself .
they need this lie to get a life lie to maintain a self-delusion .
they can make them less easy , yes , check or get to fall .
they need time .
from that time , an anecdote that you may be familiar with .
and the spanish painter , i guess , demonstrated a woman .
this woman then complained that the portrait would not look like her .
picasso says , wait for it .
it will always be more like this .
at this point , if you laugh , you realize how important this lie is , and how much time you need it to learn something that artists can tell us very well .
because artists have a broken relationship to lie .
the artist tells you something about , and especially this lady , what she doesn &apos;t see when she just looks in the mirror .
the artists share them in such a portrait of something they &apos;re only going to be familiar with when they look at this piece of artwork .
then this unpleasant feeling disappears , it may not look like you , and it will always be more like this .
here you have this mechanism , which we can use the lie as a great invention of our lives .
and not only in art , even in the people in the mythology , in the mythology , come back to stories .
you may know this idea of the lady who looked in the mirror every morning and asked him who is the most beautiful in the country ?
one day , this mirror says yes , there &apos;s a beautiful one .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
and you also know how much hostility from this true place , even the mirror can &apos;t lie , from that true place .
but we should just be familiar with the fact that you can &apos;t tell a woman that there is a more beautiful somewhere else .
here &apos;s it necessary to get what we understand under extratercorrectness , again .
we need this lie that holds us on deception without the ones we can &apos;t live in .
we don &apos;t just have in art , in the people &apos;s minds , but in science , such great lies .
and there &apos;s this story of the bischester of worom .
she heard about this book from charles darwin , the origin of species and the people .
that the man from the monkey is supposed to come and , yes , at least there was a common ancestor between people and apes .
and then she ran her to her husband , and she said , &quot; well , that &apos;s not true , what charles says . &quot;
the man &apos;s supposed to come from the monkey or have a common ancestor .
no , no , it &apos;s not .
and if it &apos;s true , then we have to prevent that people are making knowledge of it .
why do we need to prevent people to know from something if it &apos;s true ?
because we cannot live without these life-lying lives .
because we have this self-deception , this sense of being great , from the highest creatures , not from any such success , of something like this , of something that has no computation , such as one organism that exists to us , and otherwise that &apos;s unstoppable .
so , we can &apos;t do these things at all .
we need to prevent people to make sense of things , especially when they &apos;re true .
so you can see how slowly this mechanism solves , and how the traces look , that he leaves on something else as on this great picture of ourselves , i want to give you another story .
a particularly beautiful story , like i am .
my wife told me it .
she came from school one day , she &apos;s a teacher , and she talked about a student .
a autistic student .
it likes to be particularly like it , because he &apos;s got a tilt to it .
and she asked him , what are your hobbies ?
and he says , well , i &apos;m at the fire council .
and because i &apos;m at fire , i &apos;m interested in paro-engineering things .
yes , you feel it if you &apos;re a heer at that point . it &apos;s not true .
i told my wife , whenever a human being in a moral legal crisis is using the word , because we should try to replace it through the charter even though .
do that once , and then you experience the sentence .
although i &apos;m on fire , i &apos;m interested in paro-engineering things .
you feel that it &apos;s the real truth behind the emergence .
this is a little bub that &apos;s not interested in fire .
the interest in the fire .
but there is no one that we can look around , where you learn how to make fire .
there &apos;s only the second best one , the fire defense .
there he is .
and this , you don &apos;t tell his teacher that you &apos;d like to put fires somewhere and be happy when the fire goes up afterwards .
no , it looks really much better if we show that we &apos;re in charge of reducing the risks that others can only do when they put fire .
here you have this little mechanism .
this suggests that in the inner of the bub , he knew that he &apos;s actually related to the fire , but he can &apos;t say that .
here they have this censor between the unconscious and the conscious , the immediately hanging , without that they can do something about it , and the things that they know that they can look very differently , so they can sound much better for them and others .
so , just like that , these words that we &apos;re using in the language of the politically correct speech .
actually , we know something else is the case .
but we know that when we talk about it , social media is very sensitive .
we can &apos;t just do that .
it &apos;s impossible to do things like that in a society that &apos;s supposed to work .
i want to show you now what we found in my institute .
after what logic is this deception , these self-deception , the willingness to be a different reality than the ones that we actually know in the unconscious fact is to spread out the outside .
i want to show you two , maybe three examples .
the first example is , what many of you are familiar with and some of you appreciate , very few of you at all .
i mean the soul .
what is the soul ?
the soul is so fragile , say about leibniz .
it &apos;s something that &apos;s not about stop materials , materially , nature .
and if you have people who are affected , that they have a soul , or you can say , the belief that they have had come from the soul to live , then the way that the soul would have such an intellectual framework about it , is not matter of matter , it &apos;s just from matter , and blood , and blood , it &apos;s a little stone record of the earth .
and from that soul , you think that you &apos;re kind of in this cloudy nature , in this air , anima , it &apos;s in the latin , the air .
and then , if this windhall goes over the people , he &apos;s filled with dignity , with nature , with nature that can only live with soul .
and then he can walk away .
that &apos;s how the soul works .
so she &apos;s supposed to come from the outside to people .
so we should be able to think of it as something that needs to be present for our lives .
and if you have this premise of eyes , then you understand the logic that we can experience that happiness through a lie of our world .
because now you can use a three-sentence .
you know , three , you know , from school .
now this is a three-sentence , which tells us a logic .
this is the hardest part in my talk , by the way .
here you need some logic , but also the willingness to lie .
and so to lie that they can simply use this logic wrong .
in this three-sentence , three sentences .
the first sentence is , there &apos;s no soul , there &apos;s no soul .
so the second sentence is , if dung is right , then he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
i put it in particular .
a third sentence that immediately comes up with people who have a strong sense of soul .
they say who doesn &apos;t have a soul , which is dead and can &apos;t say anything .
and here you feel it .
here &apos;s the logic coming in , yes , in this deception talk .
you see it immediately .
the first two sentences who are logically correct .
because i can say everything .
the logic doesn &apos;t make any argument about reality .
i can say the canary is a man .
and when i was right , the canary is a man .
if i don &apos;t right , then the canary is not a man .
the logic doesn &apos;t make a clue about what &apos;s true .
i can claim everything .
but the key is , if i have right , it &apos;s just true .
so if dung says , there &apos;s no soul .
secondly , when he &apos;s right , he has no soul .
these things are logical .
and now our fake consciousness feels immediately , you can do something .
it &apos;s a third sentence in which nothing has the first two sentences to do with the first two sentences , and it &apos;s like the opposite of the first sentence already proved and predicted .
because in fact , we have to prove if there &apos;s the soul or not .
but with this logic that just uses it , two sentences are powerful , and a third thing is that it looks like he had something to do with that , so we can save our lives .
so , we do as if it &apos;s actually impossible without having a soul .
and we &apos;re very happy about it .
we can continue these things for different examples .
in the present moment , we have a very modern example , which keeps the daynewspaper newspapers .
you have to have another philosophical topic , a permanent burning of philosophy , present .
this has to do that we go back into the four-century century .
there was a scholars called johannes buridanus , and after that , the buridanan esel was named .
the buridanan esel is an esel that consists of a nature .
it doesn &apos;t have that soul .
that &apos;s a natural thing .
and if you place exactly the exact same in the middle between two major mammals , it &apos;s starding .
because he doesn &apos;t know what to go to a eureka lot .
so he stands in the middle .
so the natural things are presented .
and the other big forces to solve each other .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
and only if you take a different example , so if you make the one a lot bigger , then it doesn &apos;t need any reason and nothing .
automatically runs to the right thought .
so if you have this idea that in nature you &apos;re kind of being driven in nature , it will be interpreted by the larger pile that put a moment , then you have to feel that there must be something like a free will .
and if we &apos;re in france , the main one , then i remember the max-planard institute for brain research .
there &apos;s a scholars called the wolf , and by telling you , you sometimes say , wolf , there &apos;s no freedom of freedom .
now we can form the second sentence , and we can say , &quot; if wolf is right , then he does not have freedom . &quot;
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
and what we can now read almost every day in the daynewspaper , find them in this third sentence .
it &apos;s something that looks like who doesn &apos;t have any freedom of freedom , it can &apos;t be pulled for its actions and claims for responsibility and it &apos;s so wrong .
here you have it again .
in fact , you have to prove if there &apos;s something like willcare .
but the logic of deception allows us to do that as if the first sentence of suburnine is wrong , for granted , to adopt the opposite without proof .
and now you can just , if you want to do anything , if you want to test anything and you want something , especially if you want to make people happy , that courage to lie .
you practice that , for example , if you &apos;re looking at a person that you can say , there &apos;s no precedent .
and please don &apos;t use the german word for previous , which means prophet .
you can &apos;t call it , that would be a little bit more politically wrong .
you know , there &apos;s no precedent .
immediately you &apos;re going to have one for those of you who are for granted , you can &apos;t prove that .
and you have a problem .
because while you &apos;re working with it , you can &apos;t prove that you can &apos;t prove it , it &apos;s a man &apos;s husband .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he agreed .
because he led them to a ride that he doesn &apos;t even retain himself .
because , in fact , this man is not interested in evidence .
he &apos;s just interested in being free of the need to prove that there &apos;s predicted .
so , in the way of the evidence of the evidence , you can see the great force of lying .
and once again , if you have an opportunity to feel this three-sentence in other people , you do it , because you &apos;re going to make other happy people if you don &apos;t remember that kind of self-lying .
thank you for your attention .
yeah , good day .
i asked myself if i could mention it .
she &apos;s one of the more participatal here , and she asked me if i gave a lecture here and give my idea .
i have to say , you know , you &apos;ve got it , it got hard to talk to me about my idea .
and maybe i want to introduce my island project that i &apos;m trying to imagine .
but , of course , it &apos;s the sum , very many ideas .
i &apos;m probably , you know , the two nice girls there , i &apos;m probably going to be the generation for the bad oco image , because i &apos;ve been studying a nine-inch nine-meter , studying machine construction in karlsess , technical college , which is today , i believe that kit .
and it turns out to me , in the middle of the eighd years , because i wanted to make renewable energy and didn &apos;t have it .
there was the core research facility .
they were all at the time , including jewish .
the names of project today .
because a good engineer has either built some great cars or nuclear power power .
but this kind of doofes like &quot; n solar pendel , &quot; which is sort of a hundred watts from the square square meter , that was a toy .
and in berlin , there was a crazy engineering collective .
i &apos;m grateful to the governor , that he has taken the word again again , because after the mouth , you didn &apos;t use the word anymore , because everything left the left was bad .
but it wasn &apos;t that much known in the adents years .
there was this way that there was an alternative alternative business , and one of them was sitting in sideways in the courtyard where you thought it was evil .
the terrorist of terror , but that was called hartronics and has made wind and solar energy , and i started in the mid-80s .
and yes , a lot of what was said today , i feel very , very , very , a lot of beautiful spostings that i &apos;ve also been through .
i &apos;ve been working in the workforce for 11 years that was basic .
we were 20 people .
if one didn &apos;t say , that was the perpetopbestorm zip , which has a completely disposal . i &apos;ve got a lot of time to do it , if i could really do my great engineering study , because all the colleagues of my father , you &apos;ve got out of the window for the window of your child .
it &apos;s busy .
and that was really , really , very gently , and then you get in the middle of it , just showing a picture of where i was asking for 10 years , a thousand mark mark , of course , that it should be really the great .
and i then have to hold up to six and six , and then we got together with friends of solon , and then i became the founder of solon the company , which became one of the largest cellmakers of the world .
a huge implication story , but also , of course , we have the problem of a growing company and then we have two-and-a-half six , a small group , decided that we &apos;ll start back and to go back and think about the next topic of the future , which is , again , that it &apos;s not all , we talk about store .
and i brought you a project that i &apos;d like to introduce you to now .
and the title of the talk was , yes , how to get a hundred percent renewable .
and we just started asking with a relatively simpler story where you could make a sense of memory today .
on this island , this is the island graciosa on the azors .
yeah , that &apos;s the data .
there are four and a half thousand people .
you have a renewable energy percentage of five percent today .
and the question is , why don &apos;t they have more ?
it &apos;s not just technological .
if you build more wind power , it starts to fail .
and i always tell the politicians when they &apos;re in berlin-adene , our facility .
they &apos;re always saying , why ?
we already have 20 percent in germany .
can &apos;t be a problem at all .
but not , we have seven percent in europe , and our net is the european .
if we had 20 percent , we &apos;d have the same problems that people have on this island .
the question was simply , it was a one-thousandth of 2006 , the first contacts started with the island , but just through .
how big would you have to be a battery so you have a battery on 20 , 30 , four , 50 , maybe even 70 percent renewable .
and yeah , i &apos;ll go back to a slide again .
the conventional system looks like this throughout the world .
by the way , a hundred gigawatts of electrical performance will be built on yin base in the world .
that &apos;s the performance of a hundred nuclear power plants because it &apos;s very fast everywhere .
the energy hunger in the world that &apos;s going on , because you don &apos;t need permission .
that &apos;s quick .
you think of it .
and then it looks like this in the rule .
in the run , three of the ones are always going to be waiting .
yes , this is what it looks like down there .
we also have very carefully data .
and the wind force , or the solar apparatus , or whatever it is , is in the rule of a brick system , which can only put a system in small quantities here .
our goal was just to say , okay , okay .
and the one that &apos;s going to come up and the wind , the sun , the load so they can form the bigger percentage .
and if you want to go over 20 , 30 percent renewable energy , energy per year , not the performance at the moment , you have to turn off the one .
that means that at the moment you have to worry about the renewables that are kind of going to take over the whole web .
that can be , of course , only if you &apos;re here in any kind of and way .
so nobody did that in the world .
there &apos;s this in little style , so you can also control your shading over a little transformation .
people always ask me , what do you do in adliteracy ?
that &apos;s going on .
but if you want to combine several of these transformaters , and you want to build a net , it will be extremely complicated .
and our goal was , we wanted to come to the seventh to 60 percent renewable , and then there &apos;s this rest of the last , the last 10 , 20 percent renewable , which will become very , very expensive , that it &apos;s going to power out of batteries .
this is going to be an energy utility , which then , hydrogen , methane , power power to gas , you know , it will be .
you have to go to a seasonal memory , and winter summer and not just tag night .
we just wanted to know what &apos;s going on with a normal , louder electrochemical battery .
how far do you get there ?
and then a whole bunch of simulations did .
and have wind and sun and the burden simulated and came to the conclusion , a very exciting outcome that you have to have a middle of the conventional system that comes out after 20 cents a pound of about 50 cents an hour .
these were the very first calculations of six years ago .
and then we said , okay .
is that great , then we have a business model .
we &apos;re cheaper like the paralyzed system , when the duck comes up five percent a year .
and then we started to negotiate with the rabbits .
what should everything be done ?
in fact , with investors , i &apos;ve been looking for new play-doh .
we were only five people at the time to rebuild the society again .
and here again , the representation .
the brown is sort of the conventional system , the green is our system .
that our system has increased a prize , it &apos;s because we &apos;re doing 20 percent with this one , and there &apos;s a price increase to the other things .
and the power-cop , which is the power of electricity business on the island , has meant that we &apos;re very great .
we also want to support , but we don &apos;t think you can solve the technical problem .
and so we decided to build a hall in berlin where we can sort of form the electric equivalent of the island in scale to three very precisely .
that means we looked for the biggest battery to find the world &apos;s greatest battery .
here she is .
it comes from asia from asia to the trap of japan .
and most of all , she &apos;s in the seventh years in bbc teamheim , right now , today , and he was licensed to the japanese .
you can see it &apos;s a very , very large battery .
it has a megawatt , and it can take six hours for this power and that &apos;s the battery that we have sort of simulated .
and then they set up .
we also have one of these cloning portal in the same size , as it says there , in the hall to actually see the entire dynamic behavior of this network , so in the hall , it looks like this , in the back , there &apos;s the big battery that we can simulate with the net .
over here , we &apos;re simulating the whole communication system , which is the miles of the satellites in order to form the vibration behavior in the net .
and you can see that again .
we can also shift two hundred kilowatts of photovoltaics on the net .
so here we see this again , again , again , the whole single rabbit .
and what we &apos;ve done since two thousand was the hall then , until today , two hundred twelve of everything that was between the single system of electronics , we did .
so we are not makers , but we define ourselves as a company that is only between the topic of battery and the subject of everything in between .
you have to communicate , of course , to communicate , you can also communicate in the net , and that &apos;s very complicated .
the nice thing about the subject is that , in this island , you can basically take away everything that we get to the problems that we get when we &apos;re going to increase our proportion of renewable .
so this whole discussion , what is going to happen at the moment and it &apos;s moving , energy change , how to go , in the island , we have five to 30 percent accuracy energy , so we &apos;ll keep the wind and the sun .
natural light then provides smart grid .
so smart grid , a huge topic everywhere .
we can start to integrate electromobility on the island , to be able to be able to integrate the burden .
that means that if you &apos;re at seventh percent renewable , you can &apos;t do it without any memory .
you can walk through &apos; n smart grid , you can build through the nets , yes , that should be done in any case , but you will never be able to hear the percentage , but you will never get rid of memory .
and that &apos;s what the message is .
so a lot of people come and look at this , because you can see what the problems you get .
if we turn down the one , you just don &apos;t have that rotating mass , which causes a certain kind of inertia in the web .
and our european resource is essentially just out of louder mass stations of big power , where the wave is all about europe .
we look in this web , and we look at the 50 hertz , and when it &apos;s 300 thousand miles , we &apos;re starting to make a pair of sch , then a little merh , we come back up again .
that &apos;s the system .
and of course , that &apos;s incredible stuff .
if you tear it down somewhere , it takes a long time .
the hirshhorn reserve has at least 10 seconds to keep the web stable .
and in time , you can react to other people .
if you don &apos;t have that anymore , this rock mass , you have to replace it with the power caps and electrochemistry .
and we can turn out with this big battery two milliseconds .
and then you see the enormous speed of speed there .
and the message is , we need to be able to end up with these roilend masses , if we kind of like our goals 20 , 20 , 20 , 20 , 30 percent , 30 percent and so on , if we want to get to all the time .
then we have to break our way down the web .
must-run is simply called the power station to keep the frequency .
yes , that &apos;s a huge debate right now , from the coal power , because we don &apos;t otherwise , or gasturbines , because it &apos;s not .
and we &apos;re just trying to figure out that , you know , you can break the capacity , that must-run capacity , by getting the electrochemical storage into the net .
so , fortunately , there &apos;s a whole lot of studies now .
and to that purpose , people will always come and look at our research on the , sort of our island test .
and yes , the discussion is always about the question of how far you can take a chunk of the future .
and a lot of discussions that i had in the last six years were similar to the discussion that i had in the last 30 years in the last 30 years .
it &apos;s not clear , it &apos;s a child &apos;s game , we &apos;ve never calculated anything .
we have 30 gigawatts of photovoltaics in germany today .
this is precursor .
and i just get out of it that in the next 30 years we have the same capacity of electrochemical store all over the world .
very simple , it will come .
there &apos;s going to be a whole bunch of inconsistentions that are going on .
the beauty is that i &apos;ve sort of experienced the last two years in the last two years that scientists imagine my site .
we &apos;ve now got over 10 million funding projects , also in about 10,000 megawatt-battery &apos;s battery to lower the german net .
this is going to happen in the next april .
so from that , you also realize that there &apos;s a change in there , and it &apos;s just about this decline , to the notion , 100 percent renewable is true .
and if you have a hundred percent renewable , it &apos;s like an oyft system .
so far , in arguments , they &apos;re always trying to do this sediment , which they are doing , which have a very small grid , which has to do with our resource and nothing .
the question is very simple , if you make yourself completely independent from any fossil energy or ancient energy , that will be drifted out somewhere in the world , and then you &apos;re an island .
then they only use what &apos;s on the sun and wind there , where they live .
and this is a little bit of our vision of a preaching energy supply , and i &apos;m also grateful to cradle that they used to use solar energy .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing , and as soon as it comes to the talk of tasa , that you can be a collective and use solar energy , here &apos;s a little bit together .
and yes , i just want to encourage you , in the sense that you can be quiet a little bit , and you can have a vision .
and you really have to stay quite tough , but i think it &apos;s .
thank you .
when steve lopez , colomnist is the los angeles times , one day through the streets of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , an african-american american , rau , rau , homeless , who played only two strings .
many of you will know the story , because from steves articles about it later , there was a book that was refiled with robert phpez , as steve lopez and jo , as a nathaniel doladson , who was in the clearer , which was very promising by the juilliary conservatory , and whose favorite career was schizophrenia early by his paranoids .
nathaniel left juilliard , suffered a breakdown and 30 years later , he lived as homeless on the streets of the skid row in the center of los angeles .
so i suggest to you , to read , or to look at the movie , so that you don &apos;t just understand the wonderful connection between these two men , but also how the music was making these connection , and how they ended up being the instrument when this match is allowed to get it , nathaniel gone away from the street .
i met mr. ayers in 2008 , two years ago , in walt disney &apos;s parohall .
he had just heard a demo of beethoven &apos;s first and fourter symphony and came behind the stage to imagine .
he was talking to a very , very , and he talked about yo-yo clinton , and hillary clinton and about how the dodgers would never create it in the baseball world series , and all of this because of the adverse passage of the first year of beethoven &apos;s .
we were going to talk about music , and a few days later , i got an email , which said that nathaniel was interested in gwarf education .
i still have to say that nathaniel was taking care of a medical treatment , because he was already with electroshocks and with softaine and purposings , a trauma that has been tracking his whole life .
as a result of it , it &apos;s particularly prone to these schizophrenic stages , which are sometimes so bad , and it disappears away , in the streets of skid row , and being exposed to this horror row of its own mind .
and in exactly this kind of lovely stage , nathaniel was when we started with our first grade hour in walt disney , and he had lost this insane flum in his eyes and worked completely .
he talked about invisible phonmons and smoke and about how somebody wanted to flourish in sleep .
i was afraid , not because of , but i was afraid that i could lose him in one of his states , and that i could destroy him his relationship to the violin , if i started talking about audio and arpegios and other exciting forms of the didatic .
so i just started playing .
i played the first sentence of beethoven &apos;s violin concert .
and while i was playing , i realized that in nathanian eyes , there was a complete mission of change .
it was as if he was under the impact of an invisible doctor , a chemical reaction , his catalytic .
nathanicke manman &apos;s anger turned into understanding , in a calm curiosity and encourage .
and as it took him through a miracle , he took his violin , and he started playing a few clips of violin , and then asked me to play them , and then , mendelscowski , siyiwcoski .
and then we started talking about music , starting by bach about beethoven , brams , bruying and all the other bs , from bartók to esa-peons .
and i realized that he didn &apos;t just know just a encyclopedia about music , but it had a tight personal relationship with it .
he talked about her with a passion and an understanding that i only know from my colleagues in the stadium of los angeles .
by playing music and talked about music , it was made of this paranoid , confused man , who was just drawn through the streets of los angeles , a loving , educated musician .
music is medicine . music is changing us .
for nathaniel means music seelian health .
because the music allows him to shape his thoughts and delusions with help of his imagination and creativity in something real .
and so he &apos;s getting his fake states .
i understood that this is exactly the nature of art .
this is the reason why we make music : so we do something that is in all of us , deep inside , our feelings , through our artistic lens , to reality .
and the reality of that expression is that all of us , and move , inspired and united .
what nathaniel anwent , so he brought him back into a community of friends .
the prescription force of music brought him back into a family of music , who understood his talent and he realized him .
and i &apos;m always going to talk to nathaniel music , whether in the walt disney , or in skid row , because he reminds me why i got musicians .
thank you .
bruno giussani : thank you . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play a little bit , which i stole the celliest stolen .
i hope you forgive me .
so i did a lot of fish in my life .
i just loved two .
this first one , that was more like a passionate affman .
it was a beautiful fish , well-tasty , good consistent , a well-known seller on the menu .
what a fish .
even better , he was raised in aquakulv to the highest standards of sustainability .
so you could probably feel like selling it .
i had a relationship with this beauty about several months .
one day , the boss of the company , and asked whether i could talk about the sustainability of the farm .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
there was a company that was trying to solve what this incredible problem is for our cooks . how do we keep fish on our menu ?
in the last 50 years , we &apos;ve wiped out the ocean as we &apos;ve beaten forests .
it &apos;s hard to overevaluate the destruction .
90 percent of the big fish that we love , the tuna , the cure , the cure , the lax , the brix , they have collapsed .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
so , probably , or not , it &apos;s going to be fisaculsive , a part of our future .
a lot of arguments on it . fishing polles , the environment , most of them , and they &apos;re inefficient , we take tuna . a big disadvantage .
he has a stockscore of 15 to one .
that means that 15 pounds of wildlife is necessary to get a pound tuna .
not very sustainable .
it doesn &apos;t taste very well .
so here was a company trying to do it right .
i wanted to donate them .
the day before the event , i called the boss of public labor for the company .
we call it don &apos;t .
&quot; don &apos;t i say , &quot; just to have the facts right , you &apos;re famous to build so far out in the ocean , that you don &apos;t contaminate the environment . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s true , &quot; he said . &quot; we &apos;re so far outside that the waste of our fish will be distributed , not concentrated . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; we &apos;re basically a world .
this is the feed of 94 to one , &quot; he said .
&quot; the best in industry . &quot;
94 to one , great .
&quot; 94 to one thing ? what feed her ? &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . put on .
and at this evening i was in bed , and i thought , what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so i called the next day , shortly before the event , don &apos;t go .
i said , &quot; do you know what for example are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said he don &apos;t know . he &apos;s going to ask .
well , i had a phone with a couple of people in the company , and no one could give me a proper answer , until i finally did with the biologists .
we also call it don .
&quot; don &apos;t i say , &quot; for example , what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some algae and some fish mebs , and then he said , chicken pellets .
i said , &quot; chicken sylets ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , feds , skin , bone , bone flbs , yellow , dried and food . &quot;
i said , &quot; how much percent of eexpensive food is chicken ? &quot;
in the assumption of maybe two percent .
&quot; well , these are about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t , what is sustainable about eating chicken on fish ? &quot;
there was a long pause in the line and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken in the world . &quot;
i loved this fish .
no , not because i &apos;m a self-intendent and good man .
that &apos;s actually me .
no , i actually cheated from this fish because , in fact , i swear to god , the fish of this conversation after chicken .
this second fish , this is a different kind of love story .
it &apos;s the romantic way that you know the better you know your fish , you love the fish more .
i was eating him first in a restaurant in southern spain .
one reporter had spoken for a long time since this fish .
it &apos;s a kind of sump .
he came to the table with a bright , almost overwhelmed white color .
the chef had cooked him .
wait twice .
amazingly , he was still delicious .
who can so taste a fish so well after being cooked ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
let &apos;s call him miguel . actually , he &apos;s called miguel .
and no , he didn &apos;t cook the fish , and he &apos;s not a chef , at least in the way that she and i understand .
he &apos;s a biologist at fine-a la palma .
this is a fish of fish in the south western corner .
it &apos;s near the mouths of the river river .
until the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of argentinians .
they grew meat cattle on what was basically wetlands .
they did that by discleaning the country .
they built this complicated consequence of channels , and they press water from the country and out into the river .
well , they couldn &apos;t make that that worked , not economically .
and ecologically was a catastrophe .
it brought about 90 percent of the birds , which are a lot of birds .
and so in 1982 , a spanish company bought the country .
what did they do ?
they have the flow of the water around .
they literally laid down the lever .
instead of using the water , they used the channels to pull the water back .
they were running the channels .
they created a 11,000 acre fish -- barsch , marine mermaid , garal , aal -- and then miguel and his company the ecological destruction completely converge completely .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
they stare out on the horizon , which is a million miles away , and everything you &apos;re seeing are curved channels and those dense density .
i didn &apos;t have a long time ago with miguel .
he &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts charles darwin and part of &quot; a crocodile to a kiss . &quot;
okay ? because we were and fought through the wetlands and the wetlands , and i dress up , mava to my knees , and miguel keeps a biology lecture .
here he takes a rare rail .
now he mentioned the mineral needs of phytoplankton .
and here , here he is a pattern of concentrations that remind him of the production giraffe .
it turns out that miguel is spending the biggest part of his career in mikumi national park in africa .
i asked him how to become a fish expert .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish .
i &apos;m an expert for relationships . &quot;
and then he goes and fall into more of rare birds and algae and strange water plants .
and don &apos;t get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the biotic community , in the way .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
and my head became weak about this piece of delicious that i had at night .
so i cut him down . i said , &quot; miguel , how does your fish get so good ? &quot;
he showed up the algae .
&quot; i know boy , the algae , the phytoplankton , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible .
but what do your fish eat ?
how is the forations ? &quot;
well , he goes to tell me that it &apos;s such a rich system , that the fish eat what they would eat in the wild .
the plant biomass , the phytoplankton , the zooplankton , that &apos;s what the fish feeds .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely self-assembling .
there &apos;s no food .
depending on a farm that &apos;s not feeding their animals ?
later , i went around on this site with miguel , and i asked him , i said , &quot; for a place that seems to be so natural , &quot; unlike any farm i &apos;ve ever been , &quot; how do you address success ? &quot;
in the moment it was like a movie director required a stage .
and we broke around the corner , and we offered the most incredible sight , thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of incentives , literally enough the eye .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at your sword , pink .
they suck . &quot;
worse ? i was completely confused .
i said , &quot; miguel , does it not make your fish ? &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and fish eggs to the birds .
well last year on this site was 600,000 birds , more than 250 different species .
it has become the largest and one of the most important private reserves in all across europe .
i said , &quot; hey , is it a good good bird , isn &apos;t that the last thing you want to get to a fish ? &quot;
he passed his head , no .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re going to be in denial , not intense .
this is an environmental network .
the floms eat the shrimp .
the shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
so the angiogenesis is the better the system . &quot;
okay , let &apos;s rethink this . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals and a farm that measures their success to the health of their predators .
a fish of fish , but also a bird reserve .
oh , and by the way , they shouldn &apos;t even be there .
they breed in a city of 240 miles away where the ground is better for nest maintenance workers .
every morning they fly 240 miles to the farm .
and every night they fly 240 miles back .
they do that because they can follow the subject white line of the land street .
seriously .
i introduced a journey of the penguins , so i looked at miguel .
i said , &quot; miguel , fly 240 miles to the farm and then fly back 240 miles on the night ?
do you do that for the kids ? &quot;
he looked at me when i was just a song of whitney diagnosed .
he said , &quot; no . they do it because the food is better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my loved fish , which was delicious , and i don &apos;t like fish skin . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it .
it &apos;s this sort of desafing taste .
i almost never do it .
and yet , when i tried to do it in this restaurant in southern spain , she didn &apos;t look at fish at all .
they liked sweet , and they were going to take a stick of the ocean .
i mentioned to miguel and he &apos;s nicked .
he said , &quot; the skin acts like a sponge .
it &apos;s the last fight before something in the body .
she has evolved over the course of evolution to get unlocked . &quot;
and then he added it , &quot; but our water doesn &apos;t have an alien . &quot;
okay . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their fish , a farm that measures their success successfully .
and then i realized , if he says , a farm that has no inmediable , he &apos;s powerful , because the water that goes through this farm is coming in from the river from the river .
it &apos;s a river that leads all the things to it , and these days of rivers tend to lead to them , using chemical pollutants , the flow of pest .
and if it was fighting through the system , and this leaves is the water clean , as it comes from .
the system is so healthy , it clees water .
so not just a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals , not just a farm that measures their success to the health of their predators , but a farm that is literally a water supply plant , and not just for those fish , but for you and me .
because if the water flows out , it goes down in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;m going to take it , and i want you to do that , because this kind of love story , as romantic is always , is also underend .
you could say that you &apos;re a recipe for the future of good food , whether we talk about barsch or meat cattle .
what we need now is a radical new concept of agriculture , from one , in which food actually looks good .
but for many people , this is a little bit radical .
we &apos;re not a realistic , we enjoy it . we &apos;re lover .
we love weeks . we love little family businesses . we talk about local food . we eat organic .
and if you claim that the things that are in charge of the future is someone somewhere in the future , and says , &quot; hey people , i love pinchill , but how are they going to feed the world ?
how are they going to feed the world ? &quot;
can i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like this question .
no , not because we &apos;re already producing enough calories to feed the world more than just to feed .
one billion people are going to starve today .
one billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of the predators in the distribution , not the overall production .
well , i don &apos;t like this question because they have the logic of our food system over the last 50 years .
it &apos;s a grain of grain of plants , maligulating monopoly of monocultures , chemicals on the earth , chicken fish , and the whole time has simply asked the agricultural industry : &quot; if we feed more people , how awful can it be ? &quot;
this was the bottom cause . it was the legal plan . it was the business plan of agriculture .
we should call them what she is , an industries in abnates , an industry that enables fast environmental capital to make this production .
this is not an industries , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
our cornv is threatened today , not due to rise , but due to the resources of the resources .
not through the latest wounds and tractor invention , but by fertile land , not by pumps , but using fresh water , not by lighting , but through the forests , but not by fishing and nets , but by fish in the sea .
they want to feed the world ?
let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that are capable of feeding themselves ?
to do that , don &apos;t look at the agricultural model for the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
capital , chemistry and machines are on top of it , and it has never really made a good job to eat .
let &apos;s take a look at the ecological model .
this is what reaches up on two billion years of labor .
look at miguel , farmers like miguel .
businesses , that are not worlds for themselves , businesses , the recreating rather than need to use businesses , rather than just intense , farmers who are not just powerful , but experts for relationships .
because they &apos;re the ones who are also experts for taste .
and if i &apos;m really honest , you &apos;re a better chef than i will ever be .
you know , that &apos;s right , because if that &apos;s the future of good food , it will be delicious .
thank you .
if i want to give you one thing today that the entire data that we consume is larger than the sum of their parts and instead of thinking about information overload , i want you to think about how we can use information that otherwise wouldn &apos;t be visible .
so , what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical dying graph of age .
the program i use here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called spades and what i can do with pivot , that i can filter after a certain cause of death .
and immediately i see a different pattern that makes it .
and that &apos;s because in the middle of the middle here , people are most active and they are over here .
we can go one step further and then rearrange the data and see that rebreapping disease and cancer are the usual suspects , but not for everyone .
now , if we go on and close to age , we &apos;ll see 40 years or younger , that accidents are even the main cause of the people .
and who &apos;s exploring is that this is particularly true in men .
so , you can see that this is a lot of information and data in this way in a living information graph .
and if we can do this for raw data , why can &apos;t it be for content itself ?
now what we have here is the title of every single sport illustrate , which has ever been printed .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
you like to test it for my talk in your rooms .
with spades , you can dive into a decade .
you can dive into a particular year .
you can jump directly to a certain copy .
now , if i look here , i see the athletes that appear in this copy and the sporting species .
i &apos;m a lance armstrong nerd , so i &apos;m going to show you all the spending in which lance armstrong is mentioned .
now , if i want to get a handle , i could think , &quot; ok , what if i look at everything about bicycle bike ? &quot;
so i go back to one step and further the perspective .
now i see greg lemond .
and so you get an idea of that , that if you look through this kind of information , you can zoom in , broader , zoom out , zoom out , you &apos;re not just looking at it , or not just .
you do something that &apos;s actually a bit different .
it &apos;s something between , and we think it changes the way information can be used .
i want to make this idea a little bit further with about what a little bit is crazy .
what we &apos;ve done here is we &apos;ve taken every single recording , and they put it down on a small summary .
the summary contains a little overview and a symbol of the area that you come from .
i just show the top 500 of the popular graphics .
but even in this narrow view , we can do a lot of things .
immediately , we get an idea about the issues that are popular at wikipedia .
now i &apos;m going to choose the government .
now , after i voted the government , i know that the wiki action acategums that most of them are at the time .
this is really important , because this is an insight that is not in a single wiki act .
it &apos;s just to recognize if you take a step back and look at this .
at a certain one of these summaries , i can go into the subject magazine , &quot; people of the year , &quot; and all together .
now , if i look at all these people , i know that the majority of government are members of government . some of them come from science . some , even less , come from the economy . here &apos;s my boss , and one comes from the music area .
and interestingly , bono &apos;s also a ted prize .
so we can jump and look at all ted prize winners .
you see , we &apos;re surfing in the net as if it &apos;s really a net , not just side of side , but much more abstract .
and so i want to show you what a little surprise might be .
i just show you the new york times website .
pivot , this application -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not a browser , but you can look at websites with it -- and we bring that zoom technology into every single website like this .
so i can go back to one step and jump directly into a specific section .
that &apos;s why , because you just look at it by looking at websites in this way , the whole internet trajectory can look at the same way .
so i can zoom in in a particular time frame .
here &apos;s the one of the whole demonstration i gave up to here .
and i can sort of get anything i looked at today , again .
and , again , if i came out and look at everything , i can rearrange my course , maybe i can rearrange the course of my search . here , i looked for &apos; netitistic , here after bing , or here after the live labs .
and from here , i can go into the side and call it up again .
it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s used over and over again , and every time it makes the bigger picture bigger than the sum of data .
right now , in this world , we think that data is a flight .
we &apos;re talking about the fluidich of information .
we talk about &quot; drowning in information . &quot;
what if we could turn this situation and put the internet on the head so that instead of going from one to another , we can start to go from many things to many things , and see patterns that were otherwise hidden ?
if we can do that , then this past data trap , perhaps a new source of information .
and , instead of just moving into information , we can get knowledge of it .
and if we know , maybe we can pull out of it .
i mean , thank you very much .
i grew up with an idiot portion of science fiction .
in my school time , i went to school with the bus every day every day .
and my nose would always put in a book , a science fiction book , which led my thoughts in other worlds , and in a sense of naruric , my deep curiosity .
this curiosity also showed that when i was not in school , i was traveling through the forests , traveling and &quot; samples , &quot; frogs and snakes and the snakes and beetles and beetles and circuits , all home and looked at the microscope .
i was completely thrilled , you know .
it was always about trying to understand the world and the limits of the possible ones .
and my love to science fiction appeared in my environment , because back in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and examined the deep sea .
jacques cousteau came into our living rooms with his fascinating shows that animals and places showed a world of wonder that we could never have imagined before .
and that probably has a very good idea of that science fiction role .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and there &apos;s no other video games , and there &apos;s still all the video games with computer-generated films in the media landscape , and i had to create the images in my head .
we had to do that at the time . when we read a book , we took the description of the box and we launched them on the canvas in our heads .
my response to that was drawing and painting of aliens , alien worlds , robots , space ships and all this stuff .
in math , i was always caught from the teacher , and i was hiding in the back of my book .
creativity had to go out .
and something interesting happened to me , which , in fact , was fascinated by jacques coustefrom shows , the thought of a completely unknown world here on earth itself .
i certainly would never reach a alien world with a spaceship . that seemed quite unlikely to me .
but here was a world i could actually walk up here on earth , and she was just as fascinating and exotic as all that i had always imagined when i was reading these books .
so i decided that when i was 15 , i was going to get to become 15 .
the only problem was that i lived in a small village in canada , 1,000 miles away from the next ocean .
i didn &apos;t let myself get sick of that .
i touched my father , until he finally had a flood school in buffalo , new york , just on the other side of the border where we lived .
i was in a pool of charca in the middle of the winter in buffalo , new york .
but the ocean , a real ocean , was only two years later , when we moved to california .
since then , in the 40 years , i &apos;ve spent about 1,000 hours under water , and i spent 500 hours of water in submerbles .
and i learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the flat oceans , is so rich in fascinating life as we can really hardly imagine .
the imagination of nature doesn &apos;t know borders , in contrast to our own , packed human imagination .
until today , i feel deepest awe for what i see on my refrigerator .
and my love for the ocean is with the same intensity as well as ever .
and when i was looking for it as an adult , it was a filmmaker .
that seemed the best way to tell my inner imagination to tell stories with my need to unite images .
as a child , i always drew comic books and so forth .
so movies were the way to lead pictures and stories . that fit together .
of course , the stories i looked for was the science fiction area : &quot; terminator , &quot; &quot; aliens , &quot; and &quot; abyss . &quot;
i was able to do my preference for the underwater world and do this with a filmmaker .
so , basically , my two passions .
something interesting happened to &quot; marginss , &quot; to solve a narrative in this film -- and we had to create a kind of liquid water creature -- we &apos;re going to create a computer-generated animation , cg , back .
what came out of this was the first computer nonprofit user interface , which was ever in a movie .
the film didn &apos;t get any money , in fact , he just played his production costs , but i noticed something fascinating : the audience on the whole world was like mesrazed by the magic of it .
according to arthur clarke &apos;s law , you know , advanced technology and magic is not different from others .
so they saw something magical .
and i found that incredibly exciting .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that must be involved in the movie art . &quot;
so we went into &quot; terminator 2 , &quot; my next film , much further .
together with ilm , we built the guy out of liquid metal . the success depended on how this effect would come from .
and it worked . we had created something magical , and the effect in the audience was the same , but we &apos;ve played the film a little bit more money .
from these two experiences , it was a whole new world , a whole new world of creativity for film .
so i started a company , with my good friend stan winston , who was the best make-head and creomy designer , called &quot; digital theft . &quot;
the basic idea of this company was , the period of analog processes with optic printing press , and starting to start to start with the digital produced .
we also did and we managed to have a competitive advantage .
but in the middle of the 1990s , we realized that we were in the creatuable and tagging of design -- which we actually started the company -- went slowly forward .
i had written this piece , &quot; avatar , &quot; which should move the bar into visual effects and computer generated effects in all new heights , with realistic human , more realistic human being produced by cg , and the world should be cg . and the world should be cg .
but the bar is very beautiful . and the people in my company said that we &apos;re not able to be able to do that .
so i shifted that and i made this other film about the big ship that goes on .
i &apos;ve been selling this as &quot; romeo and julieon on a ship . &quot; it became a love movie , a passionate movie .
but in fact , i wanted to go down to the real truck of titanic .
that &apos;s why i made the film .
this is the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know .
but i &apos;ve convinced you , by saying , &quot; we &apos;re going to get out of the board . we &apos;re doing the real crack .
we &apos;re going to show it in the opening sequence of the film .
this is incredibly important . it &apos;s a good set of marketing . &quot;
and i talked to them , an expedition .
sounds crazy . but again , that &apos;s back to the fact that your own imagination can create a reality .
we actually created six months later , in which i found myself in a russian submerboat , four miles under the surface of the nordatlantics , and looking at the real titanic through a naked eye .
it wasn &apos;t a movie , no , it was real .
so , that really blew up me .
and the preparation of it was enormous . we had to have cameras and headlights and all kinds of things .
and i noticed how much these profound nights , a space mission looked like .
well , they were also highly engineered , and they were abundant planning .
you go up into this capsule , then you go down into these dark , awkward environments , where no hope has no hope for saving , if you don &apos;t get it back .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s just like i &apos;m in a science fiction film .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
i was quite obsessed with studying the deep sea .
anyway , the part of doing that with curiosity and science , it was all . it was adventure , it was curiosity . it was imagination .
and it was an experience that i couldn &apos;t give to hollywood .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature that we could design for a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i would see outside of the window .
in some of the following expeditions , i &apos;ve seen creatures in thermal sources , and sometimes things that i &apos;ve never seen before , sometimes things that nobody had seen before , and for the science at the time , when we saw them , had no words at all .
so that really blew me up , and i wanted to do more .
and so i met something unusual .
after the success of the titanic , i said , &quot; okay , i want to put my main career as a filmmaker in hollywood , and i &apos;m going full-time researchers for a while . &quot;
and then we started up to the bismarck , and we started exploring them with robotic witnesses .
we went back to push the titanic .
we took little robots that we had built a fiberglass cable .
our intent was to come in and look at the inside of the ship , which has never been done before .
nobody had explored the inside of the board . you had no means for it , so we developed the technology .
and so i &apos;m sitting there on the deck of the titanic , in a flood boat , and you see planks that are quite similar to this bredge and i know that once the band has played there .
and i fly with a little snapshot of insight through the shipping of the ship .
i mean , it &apos;s really , but my consciousness is within the vehicle .
it felt like i was physically inside of the titanic train of the titanic .
this was the most surreal form of a déjd vu , which i &apos;ve ever experienced , because before i get a corner of a corner , i always knew what was going to show up in the light of the vehicle , because i went through the film set when we did the film .
because the set was an accurate copy of the shipping plans .
so that was a very strange experience .
it made me consciously realize that you use this telepresence of robotic systems , and that &apos;s the kind of consciousness in the vehicle , in these other forms of existence .
it was really profound .
and maybe a little look at what might happen in some decades , if you have ibuprofen &apos;s body to explore something or do things , in all kinds of post-morums that i can think of as science fiction .
after these expeditions , we started what we saw down there , really appreciate learning , for example , this deep sea level , where we saw this incredibly amazing animal . that &apos;s sort of alien , but here on earth .
they live with chemosynthesis .
they don &apos;t exist in a sunlight based on sunlight , as we do .
and so you see animals who are right next to a 500 degrees centigrade that they can survive .
at the same time i was also very interested in space fiction , which was the science fiction effect from my childhood .
and so i ended up with the people who are interested in space , and to do that with nasa , sitting in the nasa , and plan to plan real space emissions , and they drive to russia , walking through the mission , and they go through the international space station .
that was fascinating .
but at the end , it was that i took space scientists into the deep sea .
i took them with them , and i encourage them access to the world down there : astrobiologists , planetary scientists , people who are interested in such extreme situations -- i took them to the sources that they could take , and test the instruments , so on .
in fact , we did documentary films , but actually science , more specifically , of science .
so the circle of my existence , as science fiction fantasy , was as a child , and the implementation in reality .
in the course of discovery , i &apos;ve learned a lot .
i learned a lot about science , but now i &apos;m sure you have to think a director needs to be , a leader as a ship , or something like ship .
i didn &apos;t understand a lot of leadership before i joined these expeditions .
because at a certain point , i had to say , &quot; what am i doing here ?
why do i do that ? what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
these silly films make us not a cash .
we &apos;re going to play the cost of production . from glory no trace .
everybody &apos;s thinking i went away between &quot; titanic &quot; and &quot; avatar &quot; and i would have pulled away somewhere in a towel on a beach .
i &apos;ve all taken these films , these documentary films , for a very small audience .
no glory , no honor , no money . what do you do ?
you are doing it for the sake of the challenge -- and the ocean is the most challenging environment , which is there . you &apos;re doing it because of the discovery of discovery , because of the strange connection that happens when a small group of people form a team .
because we did all this with only 10 to 12 people who have worked uninterrupted for years , sometimes we were two to three months back to the sea .
and in this community , you can see that the most important thing is that the most compelling thing you have in front of each other is because you have a challenge to overcome that you can &apos;t explain anything else .
if you go back to land and say , &quot; we had to do it , the fiberglass , the sound of sound , and all the way around , the whole technology , and the difficulty , the human performance , if you &apos;re working on lake , &quot; then you can &apos;t explain the other . it &apos;s like police or soldiers who have done something in common .
there &apos;s a connection , a reciprocal respect .
so when i came back to turn my next film &quot; avatar , &quot; i tried to apply the same leadership , which is that you self-respect your team and make it respect .
it really changed the dynamics .
so again , i stood back with a little team on unfamiliar terrain , and we wrote &quot; avatar &quot; with a new technology that didn &apos;t exist before .
incredibly exciting .
an enormous challenge .
and we became a four-and-a-half years of a four and a half years old .
it changed my way to make films completely .
there were people who said we were really doing this ocean animal , and on the planet on the pandora .
for me , it was more banal to do my job , which has changed in the outcome .
so what can we do from all of this ?
what lessons have we learned ?
i think the first is curiosity .
it &apos;s the most powerful human feature .
our imagination is a force that can even create a reality .
and the warning of your team is more important than all lorine of this world .
to me comes young filmmaker saying , &quot; give me a advice like i can do something like this . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t break yourself .
you get to others . don &apos;t do it yourself , don &apos;t bet against yourself . but take risks on you . &quot;
nasa has such an favorite sentence : &quot; failure is not an alternative . &quot;
but in the art and the study , failure has to be an alternative , because it gives you trust .
not an important undercatch , the innovation was approved without risk .
you need to be ready to take those risks .
this is the thought that i &apos;d like to share with you on the way . failure is an alternative , fear is not . thank you .
today i &apos;m talking to you about energy and climate .
and that may be surprising , because my full-time engagement at the foundation of the foundation is mainly about vaccines and seeds , to make things that we invent and provide to provide the poorest two billion a better life .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , even more important than anyone on the planet .
climate disagreement means that their sabs are not going to grow over many years , and it &apos;s too much or too little . the things are going to change how it can &apos;t stand their fragile environment .
that leads to hunger . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to uncertainty .
so , a climate change is going to be terrible for you .
also , energy for them is very important .
in fact , if you could only reduce the price of one thing , the poverty would reduce energy in far the most effective way .
well , energy is over time .
in fact , the progress society is based on energy advances .
the cohlerevolution of the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a very rapid case in the electricity and so we have refrigerators , climate change , we can make modern materials and do so many things .
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but , if we reduce the price -- let &apos;s cut the price of halve -- we &apos;re going to meet a new barrier and the barrier with co2 .
co2 is the planet , and the equation for co2 is actually quite clear .
they stretch that out of carbon , which leads to temperature elevation and has some very negative elevators , and effects on the weather and maybe worse , the indirect result that the natural ecosystems are not able to adapt to the changes and so on .
well , the exact exact relationship between a carbon increase and the temperature of temperature and where their other outcomes are , there are some disadvantages , but not very much .
and there &apos;s certainly unclarity about how bad these consequences are , but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad !
i &apos;ve asked the top scientists several times : &quot; do we really have to come down near zero ?
isn &apos;t there half or a quarter ? &quot;
the answer is , until we get close to zero , the temperature will continue .
so it &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different to say , we have a three-foot truck that has to go under a four-meter bridge , and then you can just put it underneath .
this has to go down to zero .
well , we have a lot of carbon dioxide every year , over 26 billion tons of carbon .
everybody &apos;s about 20 tons . people from poor countries , less than one .
in average , it &apos;s about five tons for everyone on the planet .
and somehow we have to create changes that reduce the zero .
it &apos;s still gone .
only different economic changes have influenced , and we have to go from rapid to reducing the rise to zero .
this equation has four factors . a little bit plancation . you have this thing on the left -- co2 , which you want to take away from the number of people , and it will depend on the number of people that everyone &apos;s using in average , the average energy for every service and carbon unit per unit of co2 .
so let &apos;s look at every aspect of every aspect and think about how we get it on zero .
probably one of these numbers has to come very close to zero .
now this is basic algebra , but let &apos;s go through it .
first we have the population .
today , 6.8 billion people .
and it &apos;s based on nine billion dollars to move .
if we are very successful with new vaccine elements , the health care and the recreation of medicine , we may be down by 10 percent to 15 percent , but at the time we see a slope in order for 1.3 .
the second factor is the services we use .
it includes everything that we eat , clothing , television , heating .
these are very good things and poverty reduction , which means to make these services accessible to each other on the planet .
it &apos;s great that this number goes up .
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we may be able to turn off and use less , but in average , that number will rise every year and so far more than double , the number of services that are being put into a person .
here we see a very basic service . is there light at home so you can read the homework ?
and these students don &apos;t have it , so they go out and read their school tasks under the street .
well , at efficiency , the e , the energy per service , is finally good news .
we have something that &apos;s not rising .
because of different successes in the light sector , through other ways , through new ways of building the city , there &apos;s a lot of services that are going to reduce some individual services by 90 percent .
in other service , as the production of fertilizers , 105 : 05 : 56,000 : 56,000 -- &amp; amp ; 11 : 05 : 55 , 05 , or air traffic , or air traffic , or air traffic , or air traffic , the play room is very much smaller .
in total , if we &apos;re optimistic , we may get a reduction to a factor of three or maybe even a factor of six .
but for the first three factors , we have now gone from 26 billion to perhaps the best 13 billion tons . and that &apos;s not enough .
so let &apos;s see the fourth factor -- and this is going to be a key factor -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 , which is synthesized per unit of energy .
it turns out whether you can get this on zero .
if you burn coal , no .
if you burn natural gas , no .
almost every manufacturing method for electricity increases today , except renewables and nuclear energy .
so , what we need to do on a global level is to create a new system .
we need energy miracles .
now when i use the term , i don &apos;t mean the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the pc is a miracle .
the internet and its services is a miracle .
people here have contributed to the development of many of these wonders .
usually there &apos;s no deadline that you need a miracle to a certain date .
usually you &apos;re just wrong , and some of them come , some people don &apos;t .
but in this case , we have to get full gas and get a miracle in very short time .
now , i asked myself , how can i really get this true ?
is there a natural argument , a demonstration that makes people out here ?
i remember last year when i brought mosquitos and somehow liked the people .
the idea was really tangible for them , you know , there are people who live with mosquitos .
for energy , this was one .
i decided that this was going to let me be free of fireflies to the environment here .
so here are some natural fireflies .
you &apos;ve told me that you don &apos;t bite . actually , you won &apos;t even leave the glass .
well , there are all kinds of playful solutions like this , but they all don &apos;t get much .
we need solutions , either one or a number of people who have an unimaginable scaling and unimaginable reliable asset , and even though there are many directions that people are looking for , i really see only five that can afford these big demands .
i &apos;ve left an all-time geographic , fusion and biofuel .
you might have a moderate contribution , and if you get better than i expect , that would be great , but my core point here is that we need to work on all those five , and we can &apos;t give up from them because they all have significant issues .
let &apos;s first look at burning fossil fuels , burning of either coal or natural gas .
what you have to do is , maybe , just , but that &apos;s not it . you have to do all the co2 , which comes from the burning of the egg , catching under pressure , and then i hope it stays there .
there are some mushroom projects that do that on a 60 percent -- 80 percent level , but it &apos;s going to be very difficult to get in 100 percent , and an agreement for the fuel of the co2 is a big challenge .
who will make it safe ?
who can guarantee what a lot of billions of times larger than any kind of waste that you can imagine from nuclear and other things ?
that &apos;s a lot of volume .
so this is a tough one .
next , nuclear energy .
it also has three big problems , and the cost , especially in high-profits countries , are high . the question for security is that you really feel that nothing can go wrong despite the human work that &apos;s not being used for weapons .
and then what do you do with the waste ?
because even though it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concerns .
so three very difficult problems that might be soluble , and that &apos;s why you should work .
the last three of the five have summarized me .
these are renewables , as they often are called .
and also , even though it &apos;s great that you don &apos;t need a fuel -- you have some outsections .
one is the energy energy that makes these technologies dramatically lower than the power of power .
these are energy sources , you talk about lots of square miles , thousands of times more area than a normal power power .
also , these sources are understated .
the sun doesn &apos;t seem all the day , it doesn &apos;t seem every day , and it doesn &apos;t seem to be the wind all the time .
so , if you &apos;re dependent on these sources , you have to have a way to get the energy in times when you &apos;re not available .
so there &apos;s a big price of challenges here . there are challenges in transmission . if we say , for example , the energy energy outside the country is , you don &apos;t just need to deal with the technology , you also have to deal with the risk that the energy comes from where it comes from .
and there &apos;s the storage problem .
and to show the dimension , i have all sorts of batteries that are made , looking at the cars , computers , mobile phones , cell phones , for everything . and that &apos;s what i found with the amount of electronic energy that could produce the world that we can produce now less than 10 minutes of the energy that we could store now .
so we need a big breakthrough here , something that will be a factor of 100 better than the approaches for time .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
this is what happens when you &apos;re trying to get these sublitive sources over and say 20 percent of the consumer .
if you care about 100 percent of it , you need an incredible magic battery .
now , where should we go : what is the right approach ?
a manhattan project ? how do we come to the target ?
what we need is a lot of companies that work on it . hundreds of them .
in each one of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
in many people , they will say , they &apos;re crazy ! that &apos;s good .
i think there are many people here in the ted group that are already engaged there .
bill big has several companies , among other things called esolar the great solar thermal technologies .
vinine khoys invested in dozens of companies doing great things , and i &apos;m trying to support this .
nathan myhrvold , and i fund a company that , maybe surprisingly , is the nuclear approach .
there are some innovations in the nuclear realm ; modular , liquid .
the evolution has stopped in this industry a while ago , so it &apos;s not a great surprise that some good concepts are around .
the terraire concept is that instead of part of the urans , you have one percent , one percent , the u235 , we decided to burn 99 percent , the u238 .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , you &apos;ve been thinking about it for a long time , but you could never simulate sensible whether it would work , but there &apos;s been modern supercomputer since , you can simulate it and see that , yes , with the right materials , it looks like this .
and because you burn those 99 percent , it &apos;s very much better .
in fact , you burn the waste , and you can actually use the waste of existing reactors as a builder .
instead of commuting the head , they burn it . a great thing .
the uranium will use graduate , a little bit like a candle .
you can see that it &apos;s a kind of column , often known as traveling wave reactor .
that really solves the fuel problem .
here &apos;s a picture of a place in kentucky .
this is the waste , the 99 percent . you &apos;ve got the part that &apos;s burned now , so it &apos;s called brighter .
the trains the u.s. for hundreds of years .
and if you &apos;re cheap in ocean water and just filtered , you get enough fuel for the rest of your planet .
you know , there &apos;s a lot of challenges there , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to get forward .
let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
how should our testimony look like ?
well , let &apos;s go to the goal that we have to reach and then we talk about the progress .
many of you talk about an 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
it &apos;s really important that we get there .
the rest of the 20 percent will be produced in poor countries , and there &apos;s still something agriculture . hopefully it &apos;s going to be heat and cement until then .
so , to reach these 80 percent , the industrial states , including countries like china , including their electrical generation completely .
the other note says whether we use the zero emissions , whether they &apos;re used in all countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest .
that &apos;s great .
this is going to be a key element of this segment .
if we go back from there , what should 2020 look like ?
it should contain the two elements again .
we should use the effects of effects in order to get reduction in the way , the less we make , the less the co2 will be the amount of co2 and also the temperature .
but in fact , this note for the things that we do not completely lead to the big reductions , just the same , or even something less important as the other ones that are the speed of innovation for this breakthroughs .
we have to track these breakthroughs with full gas , and we can measure that in corporate numbers , in a mushroom , in mushroom projects and regulation changes .
there &apos;s a lot of great books to this topic .
al gore book &quot; we have the choice , &quot; and david mckays &quot; lexicoenergy cop the hot air . &quot;
they really go through it and create a framework where this can be explored wide , because we need to support all sides .
there &apos;s a lot of that coming together .
that &apos;s a wish .
a very specific wish that we invent this technology .
if you just give me a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a vaccine , and i love that wish , or i could choose that wish , which is , halbiene energy . that &apos;s what i &apos;ll take .
this has the largest impact .
if we don &apos;t get this wish , the dig will be terrible between the long-term and short-term people , between the united states and china , between poor and rich nationo and almost all of the lives will be much worse .
so what do we need to do ?
what do i appeal to ?
we need to use for more research money .
when countries meet in places like copenhagen , they shouldn &apos;t just talk about co2 .
they should discuss this innovation , and they would be shocked by the ridiculous little bits that are spent on these innovative approaches .
we need market incentives , co2 taxes , cap &amp; amp ; trade something that creates a signal .
we need to spread the message .
we have to be sensitive to dialogue , and we have to have the things that are done by government .
it &apos;s a very important wish , but i think we can fulfill it .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you . just to understand terrapower power -- first , can you give us an idea of scale of this investment ?
bill gates : to do the simulation on a supercomputer , all the major scientists , what we &apos;ve done , we only need some 10 million . and even if we &apos;ve tested our materials in a russian reactor to make sure that it &apos;s reasonable , it &apos;s just a hundred million .
the hard step is building the first reactor , more billion , the regular and the place of actually building the first one .
as soon as the first is done , when it &apos;s going like promised , it &apos;s all clear , because the business that is energy is so different from nuclear energy as we know it .
in order to understand the right thing , which means deep in the ground , almost like a vertical column nuclear fuel , that took urans and then the process continues to go down ?
bg : exactly . now you have to put the reactor over , so there are lots of people and lots of control that can go wrong . this thing is where you can open it and put things inside -- that &apos;s not good !
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can put it for 60 years -- think of a column -- that you bury , without the whole complexity .
and it &apos;s sitting there and burning 60 years and then it &apos;s done .
a nuclear reactor that gives itself a solution to the trash .
bg : yeah . well , what happens to the trash : you can sit on it -- there &apos;s a lot less waste with this method -- then you take it and you put it in the next reactor and burn it .
and we start by taking the waste , which exists already in these refrigerates or dry caps , and that &apos;s our starting fuel .
so this is what these reactors have had a problem , which is what we &apos;re going to reduce in our fill and to dramatically reduce the waste of garbage in this process .
but as you &apos;ve been talking with different people in this world about these possibilities .
where is the biggest interest in doing this ?
bg : well we haven &apos;t set up to a place and there &apos;s a lot of interesting objection for everything that is called &quot; nuclear &quot; in the name . there are big interest and people of the company in russia , india , china -- i was here and talked about the energy agenda .
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have done something in the direction .
this is a kind of a thing that was made .
this is a very important step forward , but it &apos;s like a faster reactor and some countries have built that , so everyone who has a fast reactor is a candidate for our first .
in her imagination , time frame and chance of calling something really into life ?
bg : well we need one of these scaling , current things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to invent and then use 20 years .
this is sort of the deadline that shows us the environmental models we have to hold .
and , you know , terrapower , if everything goes well , and that &apos;s a big wish , could make it easy .
and fortunately , today there are dozens of companies , and we need hundreds , which , as well as their approaches , works for their pilots to work for their pilots .
and it would be best when there are several , because then you could use a mixture .
so anyway , we need a solution .
well , the big possible breakthroughs , is this the biggest thing you know ?
bg : an energy breakthrough is the most important .
that would have been without the environmental requirement , but the power is so much more important .
there are other innovative companies in nuclear sector .
you know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as this , but there &apos;s the modular method , which is another approach .
there &apos;s a liquid reactor , which seems to be a little difficult , but maybe that &apos;s what you might say about us .
and so there are different , but the nice thing about it is that an ancient molecule has a million times as much energy as one , say , a carbon molecule , and that &apos;s why if you can deal with the problems , and the radiation , the footprint , the footprint , and other things , almost in a liga .
if that doesn &apos;t work , what then ?
do we need to revive emergency action to try and maintain the earth &apos;s temperature ?
bg : if you get into this situation , it &apos;s as if you eat too much , and a heart attack . what do you do ? you might need a heart surgery or something like that .
there &apos;s a research that &apos;s called geoengineering , which is linked to different techniques in order to delay warming , so we would spend 20 or 30 years more .
this is just an insurance method .
you hope we don &apos;t need that .
some people say , you don &apos;t even want to work on insurance because you might do the bad thing , so you keep eating , because you know that the heart surgery will save .
i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s smart , if you take the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s now a discourse in geoengineering about whether you should have things to get faster , if things need faster than we expect .
climate change : do you have one or two sentences for you to convince ?
bg : well , unfortunately , the skeptics are in very different camps .
those who make scientific arguments are very little .
do you think there are negative effects that have to do with the clouds that move things ?
there are very , very few things you can tell at all , which is a chance in a million .
the main problem here is similar to aids .
you make the mistakes now , and you pay a lot later for it .
and so the idea is , now , if you have all kinds of urgent problems to invest in something that you only have later -- and that the investment isn &apos;t so clear , in fact , the ipcc report is not necessarily the worst scenario , and there are people in the rich world that will look at the ipcc and say , okay , that &apos;s not a big drama .
the fact is that these uncertainty should worry about us .
but my dream here is that if you can make it economic , and at the same time , the co2 is going to say , &quot; okay , it doesn &apos;t matter to me that it &apos;s not a carbon cream , i wish that it &apos;s cheaper , but i &apos;m going to accept it because it &apos;s cheaper than the previous method . &quot;
and that would be their answer to the bjbean lomborg argument that if you use all these time and energy to solve the co2 problem , all the other goals are suffering with the poverty , the poverty reduction , reducing malaria and so on , there &apos;s a dumb waste of resources that we can do for malaria and so on .
bg : well , the actual spending for research -- say the u.s. should spend 10 billion a year more than they do today -- that &apos;s not dramatic .
other things shouldn &apos;t suffer .
you come to great sums of money , and you can talk to some reasonable people if you have something that &apos;s not economic , and it &apos;s trying to fund that . most of the waste is happening .
it &apos;s because it &apos;s very short in front of a cost of cost and funded , and i think we should try more things that have the potential to be much more expensive .
if the bottom you get , it &apos;s a very high energy break , you can only get the rich .
i mean , each of us here could spend five times as much for our energy , without changing its lifestyle .
but for the lower two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
and even lomborg thinks .
his new maach is now , &quot; why don &apos;t the research work anymore ? &quot;
he &apos;s still going to , because of his former stories , with skepticism camp , but he understood that this is a very elaborate group and that &apos;s why he takes the research argument now .
and that &apos;s a meeting that i think is appropriate .
research , it &apos;s just crazy how little the supporting is .
bill , i think i &apos;m just talking about all the people here , i really hope you &apos;re going to be true . thank you very much .
bg : thank you .
a few years ago , at ted , peter skillman asked a design competition called &quot; the marshmallow challenge . &quot;
the idea is pretty simple . four teams have to open the biggest possible structure of the structure with 20 spaghetti watts , about 1m tape , and a marshmallow .
the marshmallow must be on top .
and , although it really seems , it &apos;s really hard , because people are doing very quickly working together .
and so i thought that this is an interesting idea , and i &apos;ve turned it into a design workshop .
it was a huge success .
since then , i &apos;ve been doing about 70 workshops around the world , with students , developers and architects , even with ctos of fortune 50-companies , and there &apos;s something about that task , which is a deep sensing in nature , and i want to share some of them with them .
usually most people start to engage themselves on the task .
they talk about it , they &apos;re thinking about what it &apos;s going to look like , they shoot power .
then they invest a little bit in planning and organization . they sketch and put spaghetti out .
they invest a lot of their time together in their time .
and finally , shortly before they don &apos;t have time , someone takes the marshmallow and they sit down to the top , step back and &quot; ta-da &quot; -- admire your work .
but then , almost always , it &apos;s happening , that the &quot; da &quot; is going to be a &quot; uh-oh &quot; because the weight of the marshmallow is that the whole thing is going to fall out and fall down .
there &apos;s a series of people who have much more &quot; uh-oh &quot; moments than others , and under the worst are fresh bwl college .
they lie , they cheat , they &apos;re confused and they really make a lot of stuff .
and , of course , there are teams that have much more &quot; da &quot; &quot; there &quot; and under the best are fresh students of the children &apos;s mouth .
and that &apos;s quite amazing .
as peter told us , they &apos;re not only told the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
what you might be asking is , how does this come from ? why ? what about those ?
and peter says , &quot; none of the kids invested in the head of spaghetti gmbh . &quot;
they don &apos;t spend time in power fighting .
but there &apos;s another reason .
and that is that bwl students were trained to find the right plan , ok !
and then realizing it .
what happens when you put the marshmallow on the top , you don &apos;t have time and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sound familiar , what ?
what children &apos;s child children do is they start with the marshmallow and build prototypes , successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow on the top , so that they have the opportunity to fix the way that they have low prototypes .
constructive ones recognize these kinds of collaboration as an iterative ancestor .
and with each trial , the kids get immediately feedback , and what doesn &apos;t .
so the performance , working with prototypes , is significantly -- but let &apos;s see how different teams act .
the average for most of it is about eight inches , bwl students create half of them , but not much , child children are better than the adults .
who is the most successful ?
architects and engineers , fortunately .
1m is the highest thing i &apos;ve seen .
and why ? because you can understand triangles and self-replication geometric patterns are the key to build structures .
ceos are about average . but here it is .
you put an execular administrator on the team , you &apos;re going to better better .
it &apos;s incredible . you can look around and see &quot; this team will win . &quot;
you can predict that . why is this ?
because they have special skills of the processor .
they lead the process , they understand it .
and that team , the rules and on the work , will improve a significant performance of the team .
specialized skills and process skills and their combination of success .
if you have 10 teams , the typical thing , you get about six , which have a stable structure .
i tried something interesting now .
i thought , well , let &apos;s bring the pokerer right away .
so i offered a 1010,000 price of software to the winner .
what happened to these design students ?
what was the result ?
this is what happened . not a team had a stable structure .
if anybody had built a two-inch construction , he would have carried the prize home .
so is it not interesting that high competition has a strong effect ?
we repeated this exercise with the same students .
so what happened to you ?
now she understood the advantage of the prototyping .
so from the same , bad team of a under the best .
they produced the highest construction in the near time .
so , there are profound numbers of success for us , about nature and success .
you might ask : why would someone actually invest a marshmallow challenge to create a marshmallow ?
the reason is , i help digital tools and processes to help teams , to create cars and video games .
and what the marshmallow challenge does is it helps to identify assumptions .
because frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge is a shared experience , a common language , a common language , to build the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , this sort of simple exercise .
and those of you who are interested in it can visit poison challenge.com .
it &apos;s a blog where you see the marshmallow .
there &apos;s a pac-by-step manual there .
you find crazy examples of all the world , how people can optimize the system and contaminate it .
there are also leaders .
and the base lesson , i think , is actually a commitment to sports .
it requires that we all set our senses on the task and that we use our thinking , how our emotions and our minds , in the challenge , that lies in front of us .
and sometimes a small prototype of this experience is all it needs to bring us from a &quot; uh-oh &quot; moment to a &quot; uh-oh &quot; moment .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you .
do we have a machine like that ?
a big machine , a cool ted machine , and that &apos;s a time machine .
and everyone in this room has to go in .
and you can go to the past , you can go into the future ; you can &apos;t stay in here and now .
and i wonder what you would choose , because i &apos;ve been asking my friends recently in time , and they wanted to go to the past .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back to the time before there were cars or twitter or &quot; america looking for the superstar . &quot;
i don &apos;t know .
i believe you &apos;re kind of drawn to nostalgia , to open up .
and i understand that .
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to go to the past , and not because i &apos;m an adventderer .
it &apos;s because possibilities on this planet is not going back , they go forward .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go to the future .
this is the greatest time that there was ever on this planet , no matter what it was : health , wealth , mobility , opportunities , it &apos;s critical factors .
there was never a time before .
my great-great-grandparents died when they were 60 .
my grandparents pushed this number up to 70ans .
my parents are at the orphanage .
so there should be a nine at the beginning of my death row .
but it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
a child who is born in new delhi today might expect to live as long as the richest man on the planet 100 years ago .
think about it . that &apos;s an incredible fact .
and why is that ?
smallpox . smallpox has killed billions of people on this planet .
you have reconstructed the demographics in a way that it never has ever done .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
we have them forced . puff .
in the rich world there are diseases that have millions of us even threatened by one generation , hardly yet .
diph , roman , child paralysis ...
does anybody even know what that is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , are successes of scientific method .
and from my view , the scientific method is to try and see if it works , it changes , if it doesn &apos;t work , one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
so that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , the whole good news is , because there are some other problems , and they &apos;ve been mentioned often .
and one of them is that despite all our achievements , a billion people in this world are hungry to sleep every day .
this number goes up , and it goes up very quickly , and that &apos;s embarrassing .
and not only that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to devaish this world .
drinking water , ancient land , rain forests , gas , gas : they disappear , and if we don &apos;t get out of this chaos , we &apos;re also disappearing .
so the question is , can we do that ? i think .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that will feed billions of people , without the country that they live on to rape .
i think we can power the world with energy that they don &apos;t even kill at the same time .
i really believe that , and no , that &apos;s not a rocket thinking .
but this is what keeps me awake at night -- one of the things that i think are awake at night , and we &apos;ve never really needed scientific progress as well .
and we &apos;ve never been able to put it in the situation , like we can now .
we &apos;re at the threshold to amazing , amazing events on lots of areas , and yet i really think we need to go back hundreds and thousands of years before the enlightenment , to find a time where we &apos;ve been fighting progress in the things that we &apos;ve been struggling with over these things more than now .
the people in their faith , and that &apos;s so tightly , you can &apos;t free them .
not even the truth gets free .
and listen , everybody has a right on his opinion ; even a right on his opinion of progress .
but you know what they don &apos;t quite have ?
they have no right on their own facts . &apos; tschool , they don &apos;t have .
and i took a while to figure that out .
about a decade ago , i wrote an article about vaccine for the new york , a little article .
and i was amazed , on resistance , on resistance to what is the most effective procedure in human health in history .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i just did what i always do , i wrote an article and drove .
and soon , i wrote a paper about genetic foods .
the same thing , just bigger .
people were playing crazy .
so i &apos;ve also written an article about it , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that would be &quot; frankenfood , &quot; why they believed that molecules were going to take a handle around the area of nature .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i kept doing it .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
we type , we can eat , we eat , that &apos;s okay .
but that article made me worried , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and finally i found it .
and that &apos;s because these fanatics , who were crazy at all , were no fanaticles at all .
these were people , educated people , educated people .
they were just like people in this room .
and that brought me up ...
but then i thought , you know what , be honest .
we &apos;re at a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress as we used to .
we talk about it .
we &apos;re talking about ironic , with small leadership that says , &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , so there are reasons , and i think we know what the reasons are .
we have trust in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science , and there &apos;s no reason why it shouldn &apos;t be that way .
you can just name a few names and people will understand .
chernobyl , bhopal , the challenger , vioxx , mass destruction , the united states of 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with people we thought they were always right . so be skeptical .
ask questions , demand the evidence , demand them .
don &apos;t take a clue .
but now it &apos;s : if you have to get the evidence , you take this evidence , and we &apos;re not good at that .
and i can tell the reason that we &apos;re now in an epidemic of fear , how i &apos;ve never seen it and i will never see it again .
about 12 years ago , a story was published , a terrible story that brought the autistic epidemic to the massage , muiry , and the roman vaccine in connection .
very scary .
some of the studies were done to see if that was true .
some of the studies are going to be done ; that &apos;s a serious issue .
the data came in .
the data came in from the united states , from sweden , from sweden , from canada , and they were all the same , no correlation , no link , no link .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference . it doesn &apos;t make any difference because we believe in anecdotes , we believe what we see , what we see , what makes us feel real .
we don &apos;t believe in a team of government from a government that gives us data , and i understand that we all do .
but you know what ?
the result of this was catastrophic .
catastrophic hal because of the fact : the united states is one of the only countries in the world where these vaccinators go down for massage .
that &apos;s scanddy and we should be ashamed .
it &apos;s awful .
what happened is that we could do that .
well , i understand that . i do .
because anybody here has massage ?
does a single one in the audience ever see anyone die ?
it doesn &apos;t happen very often .
it doesn &apos;t happen in this country at all , but 160,000 times in the world last year .
this is a lot of deaths , 20 per hour .
but because this is not happening here , we can put it in denial , and people like jenny mccarthy can walk around and make messages from fear and illiteracy .
and you can do that because you don &apos;t connect the cause and correlation .
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be equal , but almost never do the same .
and that &apos;s something we need to learn , and very quickly .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .
he liberated us from one of the worst hoes of humanity .
no fear , no source , child paralysis , puff , disappeared .
the guy in the middle isn &apos;t so much .
it &apos;s called paul offit .
he &apos;s just developed a couple of other people &apos;s worth of virus .
he can save the lives of 400- , 500,000 children a year in the developing world .
pretty good , right ?
now , this is good , besides that , that paul &apos;s running around and talks about vaccines and says how valuable they are , and that people should just stop doing it .
and he actually says that .
so paul is a terrorist .
if paul &apos;s talking in a public regulation , he can &apos;t tell no guns .
he gets calls at home because people like to tell him where to go to school .
and why ? because paul has made a vaccine .
i don &apos;t need to say that , but vaccines are unqualified .
take them away , return the disease back , terrible diseases , and that &apos;s happening .
we have maslow now in this country .
and that gets worse , and pretty soon kids will die again because that &apos;s just a question of numbers .
and they &apos;re not just going to die of massage .
what about your genome ? let &apos;s take that . why not ?
a comet in me wrote a couple of weeks ago , and i said i &apos;m a little bit ll .
nobody ever said that before .
she wouldn &apos;t vaccinate her kid against childhood paralysis . no means .
fine .
why ? because we don &apos;t have a child paralysis , and you know what ?
we had no child paralysis in this country yesterday .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe this morning someone has a plane in lagos , and i just fly to los angeles , right now , he &apos;s about ohio .
and in a few hours he goes and rented a car , and he comes to long beach , and he &apos;s going to visit one of these fantastic tedtalks tonight .
and he doesn &apos;t know he &apos;s infected with a paralyzing disease , and we don &apos;t know , because the world works now .
this is the planet that we live on . don &apos;t do it as if it &apos;s not .
we love to tweet in lies . we love that .
did they all have taken their vitamins this morning ?
echinacea , a small antioxiration , that helps you on the brakes .
i know you did that because half of americans are doing it every day .
they take the stuff , and they take alternative cure , and it doesn &apos;t make any difference , how often we find out that they are useless .
the data is constantly tracking this .
it evaporates their urine . they almost never do .
this is okay , you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark urgy .
i agree with you .
dark urine . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
well , i think i understand the pharmaceutical industry .
we hate a strong government . we have no trust in the system .
and that &apos;s not what we should do . our health care system is mies .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely extraordinary , and it &apos;s desuring itself to us that can afford it .
so we run away , and where do we go ?
we &apos;re going to the arms of the placebo industry .
this is great . i love the placebo industry .
but you know , this is really a serious issue , because the stuff is crap , and we give billions of dollars .
and i have all kinds of little props here .
kone of those -- gingko , fraud , echinacea , wore acai , i don &apos;t even know what this is , but we &apos;re giving billions of dollars to it , it &apos;s cheating .
and you know what ? if i say that , people would shout me up and say , &quot; what does it take you ? let people do what you want . &quot;
that &apos;s how they feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? you have wrong .
because i don &apos;t care whether it &apos;s the health minister , that says , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m not going to embrace the evidence of my experts , &quot; or some cancer source that wants to treat his patients with caffe-ups .
if you go on this path , where believe and magic evidence and science , you get to a place where you don &apos;t want to be .
they get to thabo mbeki in south africa .
he brought 400,000 of his people , because he was that red beeses were a lot more effective than antiretroviral drugs , from which we know that they can stop the course of aids .
hundreds of thousands of unavoisive deaths in a country that will be worse than any other one of these disease is vaccinated .
please tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences .
they have them . they always have them .
now , the brain countersea epidemic , where we &apos;re right now , is this absurd struggle between the fear of the native food and the bio-elite .
this is an idiotic debate . it has to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
this is ideology , not science .
everything we eat , each branch , every branch of parsilie , has changed by the people .
you know , there was no client in paradise .
there was no cankins melons .
there was no christmas trees . we did it all .
we did it in the last 11,000 years .
and some of them worked , and they don &apos;t work .
we &apos;ve got to go out of what doesn &apos;t work .
now we can do it more closely , and of course there are risks , but we can do something like vitamin a in rice , and that stuff can help millions of people to increase millions of people .
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
i have to say , i don &apos;t understand .
we dismiss food .
why do we do that ?
now , what i &apos;m constantly hearing is too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , monoculture , we don &apos;t want to deal with one thing that is wrong .
we don &apos;t want companies to patent life .
we don &apos;t want companies to have seeds .
and you know what my answer to all this is ?
yes , you &apos;re right . let &apos;s fix it .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge food problem , but that &apos;s not science .
this has nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s right , morality , patent stuff .
you know that science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works and sometimes not , but the idea that we shouldn &apos;t allow science to do their work because we fear is a real end , and she &apos;s holding millions of people off the solid .
you know , in the next 50 years we will have to grow 70 percent more food than in the moment . 70 percent .
this investment in africa over the last 30 years .
shame . shame .
they need that , and we give them not .
and why ? gene changed food .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this curved stuff like maniok .
maniok is something that &apos;s going to eat half a billion people .
it &apos;s like a mapping .
it &apos;s just a bunch of calories . it &apos;s mies .
it doesn &apos;t have nutrients ; it has no protein , and scientists are building all this .
and then people could do the food and they wouldn &apos;t be blind .
they wouldn &apos;t starve , and you know what ?
that would be nice . it wouldn &apos;t be chekes , but it would be beautiful .
and everything i can say is , why do we struggle ?
i mean , do we ask ourselves , why do we fight this ?
because we don &apos;t want to push genes around ?
it &apos;s not about putting genes around . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our fortunors on greater food , better food , more unique food .
it &apos;s not about rice crisis , it &apos;s about keeping people alive , and it &apos;s going to be the highest time to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we don &apos;t do that , if we &apos;re going to do this so far , we &apos;re going to be guilty about something that we think , i don &apos;t want to be guilty , i don &apos;t want to be high-tech colonialism .
there &apos;s no other description for what &apos;s happening here .
it &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s our not worthy , and we have to really stop that .
so after this incredibly funny conversation , you might want to say , &quot; do you want to still be in this ridiculous time machine and go into the future ? &quot;
anyway . that &apos;s what i want to do .
it &apos;s right now in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can put this time machine on everything we want .
we can move them where we want to move them , and we &apos;re going to move them where we want .
we have to take these conversations , and we need to think , but if we go to the time machine and go into the future , we &apos;re happy to have that .
i know we can , and as far as it is , it &apos;s something that needs the world now .
thank you .
thank you .
for some time , i &apos;ve been interested in the placebo effect . it may seem strange that a magician is interested in it , because they &apos;re looking at it as i said , &quot; a deception that &apos;s going to be something unusual when someone finds it enough . &quot;
in other words , sugar pills have shown a measurement effect in some studies , the placebo effect , and just because the person thinks what happens to her is a pharmaceutical or a kind of ... in the painful management , for example , there &apos;s a pharmaceutical or a kind of one in the body called the placebo effect .
a deception becomes something unusual because somebody is so comfortable with it .
so we also understand each other , i want to show you a very basic , very simple trick .
and i &apos;m going to show you how he works . this is a trick that &apos;s at least since the 1950s in the 1950s for children .
i learned him from the cub scout magic in the 1970s .
i &apos;m going to explain it for you and then explain it .
and then i &apos;m going to explain why i explain it .
so , look what happens .
the knife you can study ; my hand , you can study .
i &apos;m just going to hold the knife in my lazy .
i go back my sleeve .
and to make sure that nothing in my sleeve disappears or out of him , i &apos;m just going to push my wrist right here .
in this way , you can see that no one &apos;s going to move anything . as long as i push up here , nothing can go to my sleeve or come out .
and the goal is very simple .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully , if everything goes well , the knife will be held through my blog physical magnetism .
it &apos;s actually so solid in its place that i can shake it without the knife down .
nothing goes into my sleeve or comes out , no labels . and you can study everything .
ta-da !
now , this is a trick that i often give young kids who are interested in magic , because you can learn a lot about deception , if you look closely , even though it &apos;s a very simple trick .
probably many of you in the room know this trick .
it works like this .
i hold the knife in my hand .
i say that i &apos;ll move my wrist to make sure that nothing in my sleeve disappears or out , and that &apos;s a lie .
the reason i put my wrist in my wrist is that it makes the real secret of illusion .
in the moment , where i &apos;m going to turn my hand away from you , so that you &apos;re going to move away from the back , this finger , my time , just from where he was , in a position where he &apos;s open .
great trick ?
there &apos;s somebody in the back there who had no childhood .
so , he &apos;s here . right .
and when i turn around , the fingers change his position .
and now , you could talk about why this is a deception , why you don &apos;t get to see that there &apos;s only three fingers down here , because the mind and the way it processes information , it doesn &apos;t count one , two , three , three , but it looks as a group .
but it &apos;s actually not that right now . and then i open my hand .
of course , there will be , but not through the magnetism of my body , but through a trick , through my time , that &apos;s now there .
and when i close my hand , the same thing happens by letting me move back through this movement , that the fingers move back .
i take these hand away . and here &apos;s the knife .
this trick can show you your friends and neighbors . thank you .
now , what does this have to do with the placebo effect ?
in front of a year ago , i read a study that really came to mind me .
i &apos;m not a doctor or a scientist , and that &apos;s why it was an amazing thing to me .
because it turns out that , if you offer a placebo in the form of a white pill , in the form of an aesthetic pill , it &apos;s just a round , white pill that has a particular measurement effect .
but if you can make the shape in which you can make the placebo , for example in a smaller pill , and color color and a letter on it , it &apos;s actually measurable more effectively .
and that , although none of any pharmaceutical -- it &apos;s just pills .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
what ? that really took me off .
but it turned out that it &apos;s not all .
if you take capches , they &apos;re more effective than a pill .
a colored capsule , which is at a end and the other red , is better than a white capsule .
it &apos;s also a role .
a pill twice a day is not as good as three pills -- i can &apos;t remember the exact statistics . sorry .
but the key thing is , ...
... that also the dostzations play a role .
and the shape is a role .
and if you want to have the ultimate assignment , you want to get to the needle .
right ? a syringe with a efficiency -- a few milliliters of a efficient substance that you inject a patient .
this creates a very strong picture in your head . it &apos;s a lot stronger than a white pill .
this chart is really -- i &apos;m going to show you another time when we have a projector .
so the fact is that the white pill doesn &apos;t work as well as the blue pill that doesn &apos;t work as well as a capsule that doesn &apos;t work as well as the needle .
and none of it really has a pharmaceutical property . it &apos;s just our faith in that we have a stronger impact .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
i take something that &apos;s obviously a deception , and let it look real .
we know from this study that you have to get to the needle when it &apos;s going to go to the point .
this is an 18 inches long , and it &apos;s very , very high . and i &apos;m going to take you a little bit of sterile .
this is really my flesh . it &apos;s not a steam , special meat .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood .
now i &apos;m going to stick this needle into my skin and flow through it , until it refolds on the other side .
if you &apos;re evil -- if you fall down in ozone -- i &apos;ve led a couple of friends last night in the hotel room , and some people that i didn &apos;t know , and it has become a woman who &apos;s almost an incurable woman .
so i &apos;m proposing if you &apos;re going to be very quick , then you look for the next 30 seconds , or , you know what , i &apos;m going to do the first thing in the back here .
you can see it , but you can also see away if you want to .
so , it &apos;s like , right here , where my flesh starts at the bottom of my arm , i &apos;m just going to let a little hint .
i &apos;m sorry . do you make that crazy ?
and now just a little bit out of my skin and on the other side .
now we &apos;re actually in the same situation that we had at the bottom of it .
about .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
so , i &apos;m going to show you . this is one , two , three , five , five .
well , yeah .
i know what people think when you see this .
they say , &quot; okay , that &apos;s not so stupid , it &apos;s not the skin , just to give us a few minutes . &quot;
well , i &apos;ll show you it .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and people in the back say , &quot; okay . i haven &apos;t seen this right . &quot;
people come in the side rooms now .
let me show you just close to you .
this is really my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood .
this is my flesh , and i can rotate it around .
i &apos;m sorry . if you &apos;re bad , look away , don &apos;t look at it .
people on the back or the ones that eventually see the video at some point will say , &quot; well , this looks pretty impressive , but if it was real , it would be -- look , here &apos;s a hole and there , if it really would be hot . &quot;
okay , let me lift a little blood out of it .
yeah , here it is .
i normally would take the needle out .
i would look at my arm and show you that there &apos;s no lesint .
but i think in this context here and with the intention of doing something real , i &apos;m going to just put the needle in there and go from the stage .
we &apos;re going to see a couple more times .
i hope you &apos;re enjoying it . thank you very much .
everybody talks about happiness today .
i &apos;ve got some people counting the number of books that have been published with happiness in the last five years and they gave them about 40 , and there was a lot more .
there &apos;s a tremendous wave of interest in happiness .
there &apos;s a lot of happiness .
everybody would like to make the people happier .
but despite all this tide of work , there are several of these cognitive deaths that kind of almost impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk today is mostly about these cognitive ones .
this is true of salmon , which is about your happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists who think about happiness , because it turns out we &apos;re just so mess like anyone else .
the first of these falls is a disclaiming complexity .
it turns out that the word happiness is simply no more useful word , because we apply it to many different things .
i think there &apos;s a certain meaning in which we could test it , but in large and whole , that &apos;s something we &apos;re going to have to give up , and we &apos;ll take the complicated view of what well-being is .
the second trap is a change of experience and memory : basically , it &apos;s between happy in his life and happy to his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both combined in the idea of happiness .
and the third one is concentrations illusion , and that &apos;s the unfortunate fact that we can &apos;t think about a fact that affects well-being , without its significance .
i mean , that &apos;s a real cognitive trap .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
now , i &apos;d like to start with one example of someone who had a question-saying meeting after one of my lectures , which was a story . &#91; unclear &#93; he said he would have heard a symphony , and it was absolutely lovely music , and at the end of the recording there was a terrible circle of sound .
and then he added it really , really emotional , that has ruined the whole experience .
but it didn &apos;t .
what it ruins was the memories of the experience .
he had the experience .
he had been happy for 20 minutes .
they didn &apos;t pay because he was in love with a memory ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was everything he had to keep .
what that really tells us is we could think about ourselves and about other people in the sense of two types of self .
there &apos;s a living self that lives in the present and the present knows that the past is able to come back , but basically the present .
it &apos;s the living self that &apos;s the doctor -- you know , when the doctor says , &quot; now does it hurt if i put it here ? &quot;
and then there &apos;s a reminder of self , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going on , and the story of our life , and it &apos;s going to be that the doctor is talking to the question , &quot; how did you feel in recent time ? &quot;
or &quot; how was your journey to albania ? &quot; or something like that .
these are two very different units , the living self and the memory itself , and the two to mistake is part of the concept of happiness .
well , that &apos;s a storyteller itself .
and this starts really with a basic reaction to our memories -- it starts immediately .
we &apos;re not just telling stories when we &apos;re doing it to tell stories .
our memory tells stories , which means that what we can keep from our experience is a story .
and let &apos;s start with an example .
there &apos;s an old study .
and these are actual patients who are taking on a painful procedure .
i &apos;m not going to go into the details . it &apos;s not painful today , but it was painful when this study was done in the 1990s .
they were asked to report all 60 seconds about their pain .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
and they &apos;re asked , &quot; who &apos;s suffered more ? &quot;
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
patient b suffered clearly more . his gut was longer , and every minute of pain , the patient had patients , and more .
but now there &apos;s another question : &quot; how much did these patients think they were suffering ? &quot;
and here &apos;s a surprise .
and the surprise is that patients had a much worse remember that the patient had a lot more worse than b.
the stories of the gut reflection were different , and because a very critical part of the story is how they end up .
and none of these stories is very high or great -- but one of them is very clear .
but one of them is clearly worse than the other .
and the one that &apos;s worse is where the pain was at the end . it &apos;s a bad story .
how do we know that ?
because we asked these people after their gut reflection , and also much later , &quot; how bad was the whole thing ? &quot;
and she was much worse for a than b in the remember .
now , this is a direct conflict between the living self and the memory itself .
from view of the living self , b clearly had a worse time .
now , what you could do with patient a , and we actually did clinical trials , and it &apos;s been done , and it &apos;s been done , you could actually get the gut reflection of patient a by simply shaking the hose out with it too much .
that &apos;s going to lead the patient , but just a little bit less than before .
and when you do that for a few minutes , you make that the living self is worse from patient a bad turn , and you &apos;ve made that the memory itself is much better about patient a much better , because now you &apos;ve got a better story about your experience .
what does a story look like ?
and that &apos;s true to the stories that allow memory and it &apos;s true for stories that we invent .
so what a story is about is retrofitting , significant moments and end .
very , very important , and in this case , the end is dominated by the end .
now , the living self lives forever .
it has eyebrows of life , one after another .
and you ask , what happens to these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they are lost forever .
i mean , most of the eye of our lives -- and i &apos;ve got this -- you know , the psychological present is as long as about three seconds long , which means you know that there are about 600 million of them in a life about 600 million . most of them don &apos;t have a trace .
most of you will completely ignore from your mind .
and yet , they kind of get the impression that they should count that what &apos;s happening during these moments of life is our lives .
it &apos;s limited resource that we consume during the world .
and as we used to consume them , it seems to be important , but that &apos;s not the story that reminded itself for us .
so we have reminded ourselves , and the living self , and they &apos;re really quite different .
the biggest difference between you is dealing with time .
from the point of view , if you have a holiday , and the second week is just as good as the first day , then the two-week vacation is twice as good as the one-week vacation .
that &apos;s not how it works at all .
for the remind itself , a two-week vacation is not much better than the one-week vacation because there &apos;s no new memories being added .
they didn &apos;t change the story .
and in this way , time is actually the critical variable , which is a reminder of self from a living self , has very little impact on this story .
well , the memory itself makes more than remember and telling stories .
it &apos;s actually reported the decisions that make decisions , because if you have a patient who , let &apos;s say two of the wings in two different surgeons , and decide what he &apos;s supposed to choose , then the one he &apos;s choosing is the ones that will be less bad and that &apos;s the surgeon that will be selected .
the living self has no voice in this election .
in fact , we don &apos;t choose between experience . we choose between memories of memories .
and even if we think about the future , we don &apos;t usually think of our future as experiences .
we think about our future as a prediction .
and basically , you can look at that , you know , as an octopus of the self , and you can think of the self as one , which is sort of the living self that doesn &apos;t need the living self .
i have the impression that if we &apos;re going to holiday , it &apos;s very often the case that we &apos;re going to be doing a holiday in the service itself .
and that &apos;s a little hard to justify , i think .
i mean , how much of our memories are we ?
this is one of the explanations that &apos;s given the dominant self .
and if i think about it , i think of a vacation that we did a few years ago in antarctica , which was clearly the best vacation i had ever had , and i think quite often in relation to how often i think of other distances .
and i &apos;ve probably taken away from my memories of these three week , i would say to about 25 minutes in the last four years .
now , when i had ever opened up the folder with the 600 pictures i had spent another hour .
well , these are three weeks , and that &apos;s a big one for a half hours .
there seems to be a disagreement .
now , i like to be a little extreme , you know , how little appetite do i have on the zeon of memories , but even if you make more of it , there &apos;s a real question . why do we give memories so much weight to the weight that we &apos;re giving ?
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
imagine your next holiday , you know that at the end of the vacation , all of your images get wiped out and you get an amnestical drug , so that you will remember nothing .
now , would you choose the same vacation ?
and if you would choose a holiday , there &apos;s a conflict between your two species of self and you have to think about how you choose this conflict and that &apos;s really not obvious at all , because if you think in the sense of time , you could get an answer . and if you think in the sense of memories .
why we choose to pick the vacation that we &apos;re choosing is a problem that has a choice between the two species of self .
now , the two types of self throw two terms of happiness .
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can apply to a self .
so you can ask questions : how happy is life itself ?
and then you would ask : how happy are the eyelook in life itself ?
and they &apos;re all -- happiness is a pretty complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
and , by the way , we &apos;re able to get a pretty good idea from happiness of the living self over time .
if you ask the happiness self , it &apos;s a very different thing .
it &apos;s not about how happy a person lives .
it &apos;s about how happy or happy the person is when this person thinks about their lives .
very different term .
everybody who &apos;s not going to make terms of the terms of happiness , and i &apos;m a lot of researchers about well-being , who have laid out the exploration of happiness for a very different way .
and the distinction between happiness itself and happiness itself has been recognized in the last few years , and now you &apos;re trying to measure the two separate .
the gallup organization has a global survey , where more than half a million people have been asked about what they think about their lives and their experiences , and there were other efforts in the direction .
so in the last few years , we started learning about the happiness of the two species of self .
and the main lesson that i think we &apos;ve learned is that they &apos;re really different .
you can know how happy someone with his life is , and it really teaches them not much about how happy he lives , and vice versa .
just to give you a sense of the correlation , which is related to roughly 5 .
what that means is that if you would meet someone and you would tell you , oh , his father is a two-meter man , how much would you know about his size ?
well , you would know something about its size , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
if i tell you that someone &apos;s living as eight on a scale of 10 , they have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with his own self .
so it &apos;s low .
we know something about what the happiness self is .
we know that money is very important , targets are very important .
we know that happiness mostly means being happy with people we like to spend time with people we like .
there &apos;s other pleasure , but that &apos;s mainframe .
so if you want to maximize the happiness of the two types of self , you &apos;ll end up being very different things .
the implication of what i said here is that we really don &apos;t really want to imagine happiness for well-being .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
well , very quickly , another reason we can &apos;t think about happiness is that we don &apos;t pay attention to the same thing when we think about life and when we actually live .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people are in california , they &apos;re not going to get the correct answer .
if you ask this question , you think people need to be happier in california if they say , in ohio , in ohio .
and what happens is that when you think about life in california , you think about the difference between california and other places , and that difference is , we say , in climate .
well , it turns out that climate isn &apos;t very important for the living self , and it &apos;s not even very important for the notion itself , which is how happy people are .
now , because the first self is responsible , you can end up with some people at the end of california .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to pursue what happens with people who go to california in hope , happier .
well , you &apos;re not going to be happier .
we know that .
but one thing is going to happen . you &apos;ll think you &apos;re happier , because if you &apos;re thinking about it , you &apos;ll remember how awful the weather was in ohio . and you will feel that you made the right decision .
it &apos;s very hard to think about well-being , and i hope i gave you a sense of how hard it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question for you .
thank you .
now , when we mentioned a couple of weeks ago , they told me that there was a pretty interesting outcome that came from this gallup survey .
is this something that you can tell us about , because now you have a few minutes left ?
daniel kahneman : sure .
i think the most interesting thing we &apos;ve found in the gallup survey is a number that we didn &apos;t expect to find .
we found this in terms of happiness itself .
if we looked at how emotions relate to income .
and it turns out that under an income of 60,000 dollars a year , for americans , and that &apos;s a very big sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a big representative sample , under a $ 60000-dollar year .
60,000 .
dk : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars a year , people are unhappy , and they become increasingly unhappier , depending on them .
we get an absolutely flat line .
i mean , i &apos;ve rarely seen so flat lines .
what &apos;s going on , obviously , is that money doesn &apos;t make a disability happiness , but that lack of money is safe , and we can measure this misery very , very clear .
in the sense of the other self , remember , you get a different story .
the more money you deserve , it &apos;s you .
that &apos;s not true of emotions .
but danny , in the entire american worship is about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
when people would take this fund seriously , i mean , it seems to put everything on the head , everything we believe , for example , in terms of tax policy and so on .
is there a chance that politicians , that the country , generally , would have a fund , and make it based on politics ?
dk : you know , i think there are recognition for the role of happiness in politics .
the recognition will be slowly in the united states , no question , but in the u.k. it &apos;s just happening in other countries .
people are , you know , realizing that you should think of happiness when you think about politics .
it &apos;s going to take a while , and people are going to discuss whether they want to explore happiness happiness , or whether they want to study life review , so we have to take this discussion quite soon .
as you can get lucky , very different depends on how you think and whether you think about it yourself , or whether you think about it yourself .
this is going to affect politics , i think , in the coming years .
in the united states , you &apos;ve been able to measure the experience happiness of the population .
this is , i think , in the next one or two decades of the national statistic .
well , it seems to me , this topic , or at least should be the most interesting political debate about the next few years .
thank you for the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you , danny kahneman .
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal . i design video games .
i &apos;ve been developing online games for 10 years , and my goal for the next decade is to make it easy to save the world in reality , to save the world in online games .
i have a plan for this . i want to convince more people , including them to spend more time with playing bigger and beautiful games .
we currently spend three billion hours a week with online play .
some of you might think , &quot; this is a whole bunch of time for games . &quot;
maybe something too much time when you think about how many problems we desperately have to solve in the real world .
but in fact , in my research at the institute of the future , it &apos;s exactly the opposite .
three billion hours a week are not nearly enough to solve the most urgent problems in the world .
in fact , i believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we have to increase this time dramatically .
i &apos;ve calculated that the needed time in 21 billion hours of play is time .
this may seem something that seems to be a little bit more , so let me do it , so that if we have problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflict and obesity , i think we need to try to play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week .
no , i mean it really seriously .
why ? this picture describes pretty much why i think games are so essential to the survival of human species in the future . seriously .
this is a porent of the photographer phil toledano .
he wanted to capture the feelings of play . so he made a camera set up .
this is one of the classical words playing .
if you &apos;re not a player , maybe you can get some of the nups in this picture .
you can probably see this sense of urgency , something fear , but also the first concentration of concentration , to solve a really difficult problem .
if you also play , you see some of the nups here that are up here , and the mouth are a sign of optimism . the eyebrows show surprise .
this is a player who stands on the edge of something called epic sieges .
oh , you know that . ok . so , we have some players here .
a epic victory is a result that is so very positive that they didn &apos;t even know it was possible at all .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
and if you do it , they &apos;re shocked that they actually are able to do something like this . that &apos;s a epic victory .
this player is short of a epic victory .
and this is what we need to see on the millions of faces of problem-solving based on the world when we go to attack the next century in the next century , and the face of those who are at random of all the widrities on the edge of a epic seal .
well , unfortunately , we see this face in real life when we face difficult problems .
i call it the &quot; in life i &apos;m bad &quot; and it &apos;s actually my face , you see ? ok ? ok .
this is me , as i &apos;m doing , &quot; in life i &apos;m bad . &quot;
this is a graffiti in my former home in berkeley , california , where i studied in my ph.d. why we &apos;re doing better than the real life .
this is a problem that many players have .
we think we &apos;re not so good in the reality of play .
and i don &apos;t just mean less , even though that &apos;s about it .
we reach more in toys . i mean , in the context of motivation , something significant to do , inspired to collaboration with each other .
if we &apos;re in a game world , i believe that many of us are going to turn into our best version , anytime and immediately help , to try and solve the problem , as long as necessary , to try it after the misbeat .
and in reality , when we get failing , we feel often different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel defeated . we feel threatened , maybe depressed , frustrated , frustrated .
we never have these feelings when we play games , they just don &apos;t .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to explore as a graduate student .
why is it impossible to think , to think , you couldn &apos;t just reach anything ?
how can we transfer these feelings from play into reality ?
so i looked like the world of warcraft , which gives the ideal environment to collaborative problem-solving .
and i &apos;ve found some things that are able to do the epic wins in online worlds .
so , first , when you get in one of these online games , especially in the world of warcraft , there &apos;s a lot of different characters that are willing to trust you a world-class mission , and it &apos;s immediately .
but not just any mission , but a mission that fits perfectly to your current level in the game , right ?
so they do that .
you never get a job that you can &apos;t solve .
but always at the edge of your capabilities , you have to have a better time , but there &apos;s no unemployment in world of warcraft .
you &apos;re not sitting around , and it turns out there &apos;s always something important to do .
and there &apos;s some way of staff .
where they go , hundreds of thousands of people working with them to do their epic mission .
we don &apos;t have the real life that we have in real life , this feeling that you &apos;re willing to stand up in a fingerdish .
also , there &apos;s this epic story , this inspiring story , why we &apos;re there and what we have to do .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
they &apos;ve heard about &quot; level high , &quot; and &quot; + 1 strength , &quot; or &quot; + 1 &quot; intelligence .
this constant feedback is not in real life .
if i leave this stage , i didn &apos;t speak : + 1 and tri1 crazy idea , + 20 crazy ideas .
i don &apos;t get life in the real life .
so , the problem of cooperative online worlds like world of warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying to stand at any time on the edge of a epic seal that we would rather spend our time in this game worlds .
they &apos;re just better than reality .
until today , all the world of warcraan players have spent 5.93 million years to solve the virtual problems of afuoth .
that &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .
it may sound bad .
but to see it in context , 5.93 million years ago , our first ancestor began to go upright .
so the first exciting primate .
ok , so if we talk about how much time we spend playing with play , it &apos;s just making sense when you think about the scale of the human development , which is extraordinarily .
but also appropriate . because it turns out that by using this whole time , we actually change what we &apos;re capable of as human beings .
we &apos;re going to develop community science .
that &apos;s the truth . i believe that .
if you look at this interesting statistic , which was published recently by a researcher of carnegie mellon university , the average young man of today in a country has 10,000 hours of games with online games to the 21st years .
so , 10,000 hours is a very interesting number of reasons .
first of all , for children in the united states , 10.080 hours are the exact ubiquitous that they spend in school , from fifth grade to high school , if you never miss .
so here we have a complete parallel education path , where young people learn exactly what it means to be a good player , like everything else you learn in school .
and maybe some of you have a new book of malcolm gladwell , &quot; overwire , &quot; read .
so you know his theory of success , the theory of the success of 10,000 hours .
it &apos;s based on the great science of cognitive science that , if we &apos;re going to spend 10,000 hours on the study of any subject to the 21st year , we will be masters in it .
we &apos;re going to be so good at what to do , as well as the most important people in the world .
so , what we have here is a complete generation of young people who are master-players .
so the big question is , &quot; what exactly are players doing ? &quot;
because if we could figure that out , we &apos;d almost never have unprecedented human potential available .
so many people now have us in the world who spend at least an hour of online play .
these are our masterpieces players . 500 million people who are extraordinary in &quot; something . &quot;
and in the next decade , we have another billion players that are extraordinarily good at what they do .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
the game industry is developed , saving the energy and work on mobile phones , rather than the broadband internet , so that player on the whole world can play , especially in india , china , brazil , brazil .
you would expect an extra billion players in the next decade .
so we have 1,1.5 billion players .
so i started thinking about what it is , which is what these games are going to do .
here are the four things i found . first of all , pressing optimism .
ok , so imagine how extreme self-motivated is .
in isolation optimism is the desire to do a little bit , a hurp , to master &apos;s belief that we have a set of hope on success .
players always believe that a epic victory is possible , and that it &apos;s always worth trying to , and that &apos;s the same .
players are not around .
players are masters of their social networking nets .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting studies that show us people like , after we &apos;ve played with them , even if they &apos;ve failed us .
the reason is that it requires a lot of trust to play with someone .
we trust that someone spend time with us that the rules are going to hold out that we have the same goal and to the end of the game .
so that allows you to do that growing by binary , trust and each other .
as a result , we &apos;re building stronger social relationships .
congratuseed productivity . fantastic !
you know , there &apos;s a reason why the average word of warcraan player plays 22 hours a week , sort of as a timeline .
the reason is that if we play , we &apos;re actually happier to work hard than if we relax or nothing .
we know that we work as human beings , if we do hard , significant work .
and players are always willing to work hard when they get the right task .
and finally , epic meaning .
players love it to become part of awe of intellect .
here &apos;s a backurtion in order to go back to the right light , and you all know wikipedia , the largest wiki of the world .
the second wiki of the world , with almost 80,000 , is the world of warcraft .
five million people use it every month .
they put more information on world of warcraft on the internet than any other wiki in the world .
they create a epic story .
they create an epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , so these are four superpowers that lead to one outcome . players are super-powerful , hopeful individuals .
it &apos;s people who believe that they can change the world .
and the only problem is they believe they can change the virtual worlds , but not the real .
this is the problem i try to solve .
edward caèova is a national scientist .
his work is genius . he studied why people spend so much time , energy and money in online worlds .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re not going to witness less than a mass of mass in virtual worlds and online games . &quot;
and that &apos;s from an economist . so it &apos;s logical .
and he says ...
not like i &apos;m -- i develop games , i &apos;m a little bit exaggerate .
so he says that actually makes sense , because players can achieve more online than in the real life .
you can have a stronger social commitment to play than in real life . you get more feedback and rewards in play than in real life .
so , he says it &apos;s perfectly logical that players are spending more time in virtual world than in the real world .
i just agree , that &apos;s logical .
but it &apos;s definitely not an optical situation .
we need to start to turn the real world into a game .
my inspiration comes from an event that is 2,500 years back .
there are these ancient cube , from sheep &apos;s cube . you know ?
before this fantastic game controllers , there was a lot of sheep .
and these were the first of people developed games .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the old greek historian of the old greek historian , you may know this story . the story about how and why games were invented .
according to herodotus , games were being invented , in the kingdom as a famine .
there was a huge famine that the king of lydies decided to have a crazy idea .
people were suffering . people fought .
it was an extreme situation . you needed a extreme solution .
so they invented , according to herodotus , that &apos;s a national strategy and raised a national strategy . on a day , you would eat . the next day you would play .
and they would be very immersed in the box , because they &apos;re so fascinating , and they &apos;re very gracially related to us , happier productivity , that they would forget nothing to eat .
and then the next day you would play . and the next day you would eat food .
and according to herodotus , they survived this famine for 18 years by eating this famine in a day and the next playing .
likewise , i think we &apos;re playing games today .
we &apos;re making games to escape the world &apos;s suffering .
we &apos;re making games in order to get everything that doesn &apos;t work in the real world , and it &apos;s not satisfying in real life , and we &apos;re going to take what we need from play .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
that &apos;s the exciting thing .
according to herodotus , after 18 years , the famine didn &apos;t get better for me , so the king , the king , was going to play a last thing .
they divided the kingdom into two halves .
they were playing a box , and the sieger had to break into a epic adventure .
they left , and they went to the search for a new home . they just had so many people back , as there were food to survive , and they were looking for the rest of a place where they were thriving .
that sounds crazy , right ?
but the latest dna evidence shows that the phoenix kingdom , the ones who made the roman empire , the same dna like the old lyters .
so scientists recently came to the notion that herodotus &apos;s insane story was actually true .
and geologists found evidence of global warming , which took almost 20 years to explain what the famine could explain .
so this crazy story could vote .
maybe they actually saved their people through play by putting 18 years in games and then they had learned so much about what they learned , and so much about that , they &apos;ve saved the whole civilization .
so , we can .
we &apos;ve been playing in 1994 .
this was the first strategy in real time in the world of warcraan series , which was 16 years ago .
they were playing for 18 years , we &apos;ve been playing warcraft for 16 years .
i &apos;m saying we &apos;re ready for our own epic game .
so , they sent half of their civilization to search for a new world . so i take my 21 billion games a week .
we should be feeding that half of us spend an hour playing with play , until we &apos;ve solved the problems of the real world .
i know you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; how do we solve problems of real world in games ? &quot; and in fact , i &apos;ve dedicated my work in the last few years to the future for the future .
we have this banner in our office in palo alto , and we should press the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to tell the future before .
what we want is to create the future .
we want to think of the best result , and then people powerful to make this idea in the reality .
we put epic wins , and we give people to reach them .
i &apos;m going to show you just three games that i &apos;ve designed to try to bring people back to people in their own future .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
the game is by 2007 .
it &apos;s an online game that you have to get through an oil scarcity .
the oil scarcity are invented , but we have enough online content so that it &apos;s going to be realistic , and they actually live their real lives without oil . so , if they push up to the game , they tell us where they &apos;re living . and then they get news movies in real time that will show them how much oil is being closed , how much oil is being closed , how much it is , what has it been like , food or photos .
we tested this game with 1,700 players in 2007 , and we &apos;ve accompanied them since the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was a transformative experience .
no one wants to change his life because it &apos;s good for the environment or because we should .
but if you &apos;re in a epic adventure , and you say , &quot; we &apos;re going to go out of oil . &quot;
that &apos;s a fascinating adventure you &apos;re going to do .
find out how they survive . most of our players have redone the habits in the game .
so for the next world record , we have a bigger , higher target than just oil scarcity .
we &apos;ve developed the game &quot; superstruct &quot; at the institute for the future .
the computation of a supercomputer is that people only have 23 years on the planet .
this supercomputer is called &quot; global immortal , &quot; sensitive system , of course .
the call of players , to report , have made us almost like a &quot; jerry-brum film . &quot;
you know jerry bruckheir films , where there &apos;s the &quot; push team . &quot; you have astronauts , the former , the ex-laureing , and only together you can save the world .
but in our game , instead of just five people , we say , everybody is in the sink team , and it &apos;s our job to create the future for energy , food , security , security and the future of social justice .
8,000 players played the game for eight weeks .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that they can read when they google &quot; superstruct . &quot;
and the last game is bringing out the third march . it &apos;s a game in collaboration with the world bank .
if you finish the game , you get the award of the world bank , &quot; social retrofits , &quot; in 2010 .
we work with universities in a whole sub-saharan africa , and we &apos;re learning to learn a social spread .
we have a comic book . we have &quot; levels &quot; for local understanding , knowledge , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .
i want to invite you all to share this game with young people , all around the world , especially in development areas that benefit from that , to save their own social enterprise to save the world .
i come to the end .
i want to ask you something .
what do you think happens next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t saved the world yet .
well , i hope you agree with me that players are human resources that we can use to work in real life , and that games have a big meaning for change .
we have all these superpowers , blinbling productivity , the ability to spread strong social networks , and the demand for meaning .
i really hope we play significant games together to survive on this planet another century .
and i hope you &apos;ll play with me like this , and play .
if i look at the next decade , i &apos;m sure about two things : that we can create every able future , and we can play all kinds of games .
so i say , let &apos;s start the world changing games !
thank you .
i &apos;d like to tell you a little bit about what a few months ago in writing an article for gross wired .
i always have my synonymous dictionary on the writing , but i was done with the work of the textile , and i realized that i was never in my life , what the word &quot; disabled &quot; really means .
i read you the post .
&quot; disabled , &quot; adjective , and , &quot; untie , helpless , destroyed , swallate , mutiled , verated , cured , swallow , swallow , swallowed , unpotent , unpotent , unpotent , unpotent , and fine .
antonyme : healthy , strong , powerful .
i read this list of a friend according to a friend , and i had to laugh at it , it felt so ridiculous , but i just got to &quot; bew &quot; and i didn &apos;t have to keep talking , and i had to get to read and put myself on this kind of emotional shock .
of course , this was a famous old synonyity dictionary , and i just thought that the issue has to be pretty old .
but in fact , it was a copy of the early 1980s when i first started elementary school and started building my own image outside of my family and form to form , also in terms of other children and the rest around me .
and thank god i didn &apos;t use synonyity at the time .
i would take this post seriously , i was born into a world that someone like me would perceive as a person whose life can actually do positive in any way , but today i &apos;m going to be celebrated for the opportunity and adventure i &apos;ve experienced .
so i immediately called the online copy of 2009 , and i expect to find that i find one of their contributions here .
here &apos;s the current version of this one .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
in particular , the last two words in &quot; near antonyms &quot; &quot; near &quot; and &quot; healthy . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about words .
it &apos;s about what we think about the people we describe with these words .
it &apos;s about the values that are in these words , and how we construct these values .
our language affects our thinking and how we see the world and the people around us .
many ancient societies , including the greeks and the roman , really believed that the language of a plane has a huge force , because what you &apos;re talking about , also can be manifest .
so , what do we really want to manifest -- a disabled person or a powerful human being ?
you know , just a human being to call eight more than a child , and it could be enough to retaliate them and give them beliefs .
wouldn &apos;t it be nice to open your doors ?
a man who opened up to me was my pediatrician at the a.i. dupont institute in wilskrington .
it &apos;s called dr. pizbetillo . an italo american name , whose name , as you can think of , the most americans couldn &apos;t speak correctly . so he was called dr. p. .
and dr. p. always wore very colorful flies and was just designed to work with kids .
i found the time i spent in this hospital just great -- to my physiological therapy .
i had to take a lot of work on this thick , elastic , elastic -- in different colors -- you know , to build my leg muscles , and i hated these bands more than anything else . i hated them . i hated them . i hated them .
and imagine , i even have a five-year-old child with dr. p. verbe , and so i tried to stop this exercise , natural without success .
and one day he looked at me at one of my exercises -- these exercises were just tiring and screaming -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re such a strong , powerful and young girl , you &apos;re going to tear one day .
and when you make it , i give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
that was , of course , just a simple trick of dr. p. , so i do the practice that i didn &apos;t want to do with the prospect that the richest five-year-old girl in the hospital is going to be in the second floor , but he actually got me to see my daily practice with new eyes .
and i &apos;m going to ask you today how much his vision of me as a strong and powerful young girl has shaped my own picture , and i could imagine , as one of the great , powerful , powerful and breathing human beings .
this is just one example of many , as adults can make the imagination of a child .
but as the final examples of the synonyics prove to us , our language doesn &apos;t give us a room , to imagine what we would all wish to do : to allow each individual to see themselves as powerful people .
our language is the social change that has been caused by a technological change in many cases .
and , of course , from the medical standpoint , you can say that my legs , the laser surgery for visually disabilities , kunslive of titan and artificial heights for aging , that allow people to really use their natural fate and to build on the limits that they put their natural fate on , people will not be able to talk about social networking platforms , people that they have on their own own way , not to talk about their own identity .
so perhaps this technological change clearly shows that there &apos;s always a different truth , which is that every person of the society has something very special and can give it very powerful that human ability , to adapt , is our biggest one .
the human ability to adapt -- this is an interesting story , because people always ask me to tell you how i &apos;m going to move with widrities and i &apos;m going to give you something : this sentence has never really felt and i feel very uncomfortable with why .
this phrase lives with widrities with the idea that success depends or happiness depends on a challenge , without being able to be able to do a challenge , without being able to be able to do it with a prosthetic experience , whether my life was so successful .
but the truth is that we change . of course we are designed by the challenge , whether it &apos;s physically , emotionally or even both .
and i argue that this is good .
widrities are not a barrier that we have to turn around to make our lives better .
widrities are just to our lives .
and i practice to see widrities as my shadow .
sometimes i know that he &apos;s very present , sometimes he &apos;s not to see , but he &apos;s constantly at me .
and i mean , i don &apos;t want to put into the impact or the severe of the city of a human being .
in life , there are challenges in life , and the challenges , and these are just to real and every person , but the question is not whether we &apos;re going to come up with widrities or not , but how we get to it .
so we &apos;re not just responsible for people to keep the people we love , but they also prepare to get good with it .
and we have no favor of our kids when we give them the feeling that they cannot adapt .
you have to separate two things : one to the medical fact , to be amputated , and to the other people think about whether i &apos;m disabled or not .
and to be honest , the only real real and lead disability that i had to put apart with is that the world is constantly , you can describe me with these definitions .
in our desire to protect people who are in the heart and tell us the cool , hard truth about their medical commentary , or even a forecast to the quality of life that they would expect , we have to be careful that somebody is actually disabled .
maybe this is the current concept , which is just looking at what &apos;s in a broken , and how we fix it , for every single one of a larger disability than the pathology .
if we don &apos;t treat a human being , and not all of his forces and possibilities , we create in addition to the natural struggle that you may have to lead to another disease .
we put a people who have value to our society .
so we have to look beyond the patology and focus on all of the human possibilities .
but the most important thing is , it &apos;s between perception of our ilences and our great creative minds , a connection .
we shouldn &apos;t leverage those challenging times , and we shouldn &apos;t try to avoid them , but we shouldn &apos;t try to avoid them under the carpet , but it &apos;s about realizing in the widrities .
i think maybe it &apos;s more likely to make sure that we don &apos;t necessarily have to go through widrities , but that we &apos;re open to it , they &apos;re going to pick up , to put them on the sigk , and maybe even do it to dance .
and maybe we can do it as a kind of natural , consistent and useful and useful , and we don &apos;t feel so much through their presence .
in this year , we celebrate the 200 . anniversary of charles darwin and when he wrote about 150 years ago about evolution , darwin , in my eyes , on something very true in the human character .
i would write it like this : not the most powerful of his species , and not the intelligent of his species , but the one that can adapt to the best .
from conflicts comes creativity .
not only from darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability to survive , to survive , is determined by the struggle of the human mind , to transform through conflict .
so , again , change and adaptation are the greatest skills of people .
and maybe we only know what wood we are doing when we really tested .
maybe that &apos;s the point of widrities , a perception of the ocean , a sense of our own force .
we can give ourselves something like this .
we can give a new meaning that goes beyond severe times .
maybe we can see widrities as change .
widrities are for change that we haven &apos;t adapted to .
i think the biggest damage we &apos;ve added ourselves is to believe that we should be normal .
honestly , who &apos;s normal ?
there &apos;s no normal .
there &apos;s the usual . the typical one , but not the normal . and wouldn &apos;t you really want to know these arms , gray person , if they really were there ?
i think rather not .
it would be great if we think of this paradigm of normal communication against another one of the possibilities or the strength to even replace it a little bit more dangerous , and so we could release the forces of very many children , and invite them to bring their own special and valuable skills to society .
julipolgen found that we have people from the members of our society always have an incentive to be useful and to contribute .
there &apos;s evidence that the neanderthals have had older people and people with severe physical injuries , and that might have happened , because the life experience in the survival of these people was valuable .
they haven &apos;t looked at these people as broken and useless ; they were treated as something special and valuable .
a few years ago , i went in the city where i grew up in a food market in this red zone in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i stood there in front of a flock of togeny .
it was summer and i had branches .
and i hear how a guy behind me says , &quot; well , if that &apos;s not aimee mullins . &quot;
and i &apos;m looking around and i see this older man . i had no idea who he is .
and i said , &quot; sorry , sir , we know ? i can &apos;t remember them . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , you may not remember me .
when i first saw her , i brought her out of her mother &apos;s belly . &quot;
oh , so that .
and of course , it did click on .
this was dr. kean , a man i knew only from narratives of my mother &apos;s day because i came to late , of course , to my birthday two weeks late .
the doctor for preins diagnosed my mother was on vacation , and so my parents knew the man who brought me to the world at all .
and because i was born without car legs , and my feet were looking for them , and i only had a few toes at this and a few toes on the other feet , and he had a little toes of the other foot .
he said to me , &quot; i had to tell your parents that you would never walk , and never going to be like other kids , or that you could never have an independent life , and you &apos;ve just got me lying . &quot;
really , i found that he had collected newspaper clips of my entire childhood , whether i had won a letter competition in the second class , whether i was going to get rid of the tips on the sypad , no matter whether i had my scholarship or one of my sports wins .
and he called this part of his curator the x factor , the potential of the human gain .
you can &apos;t easily emphasize how much of this factor of life can be a human being .
and dr. kean told birth , he said , &quot; i &apos;ve learned that kids , if they didn &apos;t say anything else , and even if they get a little bit of support , they can get kids a lot . &quot;
see , dr. kean has changed his thinking .
he had understood that the medical diagnosis , and as somebody involved with it , are two different things .
and i &apos;ve also changed my thinking in the course of time when they asked me if i would have asked my prostheses to the legs of meat and bones , then i would have no offended .
i really wanted to be normal .
if you ask me this today , i &apos;m not sure .
and that &apos;s because i &apos;ve experienced something with my legs , and not despite these experiences .
and maybe this change could happen , because i &apos;ve met so many people who have opened doors , instead of looking at people who would contaminate me or i wanted to make an idea .
look , it really takes a person who tells you how they can manifest their forces , and they &apos;re through .
if you allow someone to activate your own , internal forces , the human mind is so prepared -- if you can do that , and you open up for somebody in a critical moment , you &apos;re a very good teacher for these people .
they bring them to open doors .
the real meaning of &quot; cloudce &quot; in the word &quot; eduardo . &quot;
it means something to produce that in one is the potential to tickle .
again , what potential do we want to call off ?
in the &apos; 60s , in britain , there was a case study done in britain at the time .
they call this &quot; mastery trials &quot; in the u.s. we call it &quot; shake . &quot;
students get broken up for grades .
and the a student will test coins harder , get the better teachers and so forth .
and then they gave over a three-month period of students with a &quot; enough note &quot; -- it was said to them , they were very clever , and after those three months , they really wrote it .
and of course it breaks out to hear the heart that vice versa said , they &apos;re only enough .
and it was also the three months later .
but only those who are still in school -- apart from the students who had the school of school .
the key thing about this study was that the teachers were not balanced .
the teachers didn &apos;t know something changed .
they were simply told that being the students and they are the students with the note enough , and they taught them something and they were treating them .
the only real disability is a broken spirit of mind , which was broken , has no hope of any hope . it doesn &apos;t find anything more beautiful . it &apos;s not a natural , pure interest , and our innate ability of imagination .
but if we can manage to support the human spirit , we continue to hope to find ourselves and other people around them , and then to be more curious , and then we really get a positive one .
if a mind has about these qualities , we can create a new reality and create new forms .
i want to end with a poem that was written by an persian poet named hafiz in the 140s , and i told my friend jacques , and the poem is called &quot; the god , who knows only four words . &quot; &quot; every child who knows only four words . &quot; &quot; every child who knows only four words , not the god of the names , but the god that does only repeat four . &quot;
come on , dance with me . thank you .
how would you want to be better than you are right now ?
suppose i said that through few changes of your genes , you could have a better memory -- more precise , more difficult and faster .
or you want to be solar , stronger , more force .
do you want to become attractive and self-confident ?
how would it be to live longer in good health ?
or maybe they &apos;re one of those who always has more creativity .
what would you love most ?
what would you like to have if you could only have one ?
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see .
a few . probably so many of the things that are creative people here .
that &apos;s very good .
how many would be deciding for a good memory ?
a few more .
how about fitness ?
a few fewer .
what about longevity ?
ah , the majority . this is what i like to see as a doctor .
if you could have one of them , it would be a very different world .
is it all just education ?
or may it be possible ?
evolution has been an ongoing issue here on the ted conference , but today i want to give you the view of a doctor .
the big genetic in the 20th century , d.c. gs , who was also a communist in the russian orthodox church , once wrote a set , &quot; nothing in biology doesn &apos;t make sense in biology except in the light of evolution . &quot;
well , if you &apos;re one of those who doesn &apos;t accept the proof of biological evolution , this would be a very good time to turn out your listening device , take your personal communications -- i &apos;ll give you the permission and maybe you can throw a look at kathryn schultz &apos;s book that &apos;s about to make any sense of it .
but if you accept biological evolution , what do you think is : is it just over the past , or is it about the future ?
is it fun for other people or are there ?
this is another look at the tree of life .
in this picture , i &apos;ve put a bush as a center of the tempting in all directions , because if you look at the edges of the tree of life , all the existing species of these branches have succeeded in evolutionary terms : you have survived it ; it acts its environment .
the human part of this book , far at the end , is of course that we &apos;re most interested in .
we go from a common ancestor to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago .
in this period , maybe there were 20 or 25 different species of hominids .
some have come and walked .
we &apos;ve been here for about 130,000 years .
it seems like we &apos;re right from the other parts of the brain , but actually the biggest part , are the basic mechanisms of our cells quite equal .
is it clear that we can use it and allow the mechanisms of a common bacterium to produce the protein of the human insulin , which is used to treat diabetics ?
this is not like human insulin ; this is the same protein that &apos;s not an individual , which comes from the pancreas .
and we already talk about bacteria , is you realize that each of us in our gut is more bacterial than cells in the rest of our body ?
maybe 10 times as many .
i mean , do you think when antonio damasio asked you to think about the bacteria ?
our gut is a wonderful hospitable environment for these bacteria .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s fire , it &apos;s very comfort .
and you &apos;re going to tell them all the nutrients that they would just wish without any effort .
it &apos;s really a much easier way to get bacteria , with a combination of an unintended discontinuity of the unintended , jeodch .
but otherwise , they &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria , just as they are important for their lives .
they help with dication nutrients , and they protect them against certain diseases .
but what will come in the future ?
are we in a kind of evolutionary equilibrium in a species of species ?
or are we determined to be something else -- something that might be adapted to the environment ?
now , let &apos;s take a step back in the history of the big bang 14 trillion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years ago -- the first signs of living beings , perhaps three to four billion years ago , perhaps three to four billion years ago , and then the human species that eventually form the last 130,000 years .
in this huge unended symphony of the universe , the life on earth is just very short to measure ; the animal kingdom , like a single one , and the human life , a small yield .
we were .
this also represents the kind of entertainment of this speech , so i hope to leave you .
now , when i was a nest on college , i had my first biology department .
i was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology .
i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i asked something very fundamental : in most of the existence of life in soliarious organisms , each cell , and all the genetic information of the cell is going to continue in both of the genetic cells .
but at the time , as multilical organisms appear , things began to change .
sexual reproduction is the picture .
and very important , with the introduction of sexual reproduction that &apos;s going to continue the genome , the rest of the body will be consistent .
in fact , in fact , you might say that the inevitable of death in our body could take over at the same moment as the sexual reproduction .
now i have to stand up when i was a college student , i thought , okay , sex / death , sex / death , death for sex -- it seemed to be quite reasonable at the time , but with every year , it has come to my increasing issues .
i &apos;ve come to understand the feelings of george burns , reading in las vegas his show in the &apos; 90s .
and one night , there &apos;s a pat on his hotel hall .
it opens the door .
in front of him , there &apos;s a beautiful piece of paper .
she looks at him and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for super-sex . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s wonderful , &quot; george says , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the soup . &quot;
i came to the realization of being a doctor i was working differently than the goal of evolution -- not inevitable , only different .
i tried to keep the body .
i wanted to keep ourselves healthy .
i wanted to recreate the health for a disease .
i wanted to do a long and healthy life .
evolution is all about the rest of the genome on the next generation , adaptation and survival generation .
from a evolutionary standpoint , they are and i developed like booster rockets to send the genetic focus into the next stage of orbit , and then to drop into the ocean .
i think we would all understand the mood , the woody all for expression , when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to deal with my work .
i want to do it by not dying . &quot;
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily mean the longest life .
it doesn &apos;t necessarily affect the largest , the most powerful or the fastest , and not even the smartest .
evolution priats the creatures that adapt best to their environment .
it &apos;s the test of survival and success .
on the bottom of the ocean , bacteria are there , which are thermophil , and by using the so-called steam , otherwise if fish were there , it would have a vacuum coiled fish to follow the fish , yet they did it there .
so , what does that mean when we look back at what &apos;s happening in evolution , and how we think about the space of people in evolution , and most of all , we need to look into the next phase , i would say there &apos;s a series of possibilities .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to move forward .
we &apos;ve reached a kind of balance .
and the reason for that would be that the first thing that we did was to preserve a lot of genes that would otherwise have been chosen and removed from the population .
and the second thing we have as a species of our environment is that we &apos;ve managed to adapt to them as well as we adapt to them .
and by the way , we go and cirlate so much that you can &apos;t tell longer that isolation is necessary for evolution to find .
a second possibility is that it will be a evolution of traditional species , of course , depending on the forces of nature .
and the argument here would be that the wheels of evolution would slow slowly , but they &apos;re unpleasant .
and so far the isolation , when we go distant as a species , it becomes isolated and the changes of the environment that could produce evolution in natural ways .
but there &apos;s a third way to have a very compelling , fascinating and terrifying possibility .
i call it neo-evolution -- the new development that isn &apos;t just natural , but led by us as an individual , in the decisions that we make .
now , how could that happen ?
how could it be that we do this ?
let &apos;s first look at the reality that people today are making decisions about their offspring .
they are , in some cultures , to have more men than women .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and family decide .
so think , if it wasn &apos;t just possible to choose your child &apos;s gender but also the body pollution , the diseases that would cure and prevent disease .
what if they could make the genetic change in order to eliminate diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s disease or eliminating the cancer risk or stroke ?
wouldn &apos;t you want it to make these changes in your genes ?
if we look forward , these kinds of changes will be possible .
the human genome project began in 1990 , and it took 13 years .
it cost 2.7 billion dollars .
next year , when it was finished in 2004 , they could do the same thing for 20 million dollars in drdra to four months .
today , you can have a sequence of three billion base pairs of the human genome to a price of about $ 20,000 and in the space of about a week .
it &apos;s not going to take long for the reality that there will be a thousand dollars of human genomes , and it will be increasingly available for everybody .
a week ago , the national academy of engineering of engineering , the draper prize for francis arnold and wilremstemmer , two scientists who developed independently the natural process of evolution is called the natural process to work faster and to take some amazing proteins in a more efficient way -- which frances arnold called direct .
a few years ago , the laser price was pirated by a scientist , for his research in which he took an adult to his research , a fibrolic , and through manipulation of just four genes , turning it back to an pluripotent bloodcell -- a cell is potentially able to get any cell into your body .
these changes are coming .
the same technology that can make the human insulin in bacteria that can &apos;t only protect them from themselves , but also to serve the immunity against other viruses .
whether you believe it or not , it &apos;s an experimental study in the gang with influenza that had been built in the cells of a spreactic plant .
can you imagine something good that comes from spreak ?
this is all reality today , and the future will be much more possible .
so just imagine two other little changes .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change your cells ?
what if you could change the sperm and the ice cells or the fresh fertilization to give your kids a better chance for a healthier life -- get the diabetes , reduce the risk of cancer ?
who does not want to change a healthier child ?
and then the analytic technology , the same engine of science that can allow the change to prevent the disease , could also enable us to allow ourselves to adopt a hyper-grid , hyper-capacity .
why don &apos;t they have the crackers of one ken jennings , especially if you can expand it with the next generation of the watals ?
why not have the quick muscle fibers that allow them to run faster and longer ?
why not live longer ?
these are going to be inconsistent .
and if we &apos;re at a point where we can pass it to the next generation , and we adopted the attributes that we want to be transformed from al style to evolution evolution .
we &apos;re going to have a process that requires potentially 100,000 years , and we can compress it in a thousand years and maybe even on the next 100 years .
these are decisions that their grandchildren , or their grandchildren , have to be around .
do we use a society to form a society that is better , that is more effective ?
or will we selectively choose different attributes that we want to have for some of us and not for others ?
are we going to form a society , and we are uniformated , and it &apos;s robust , or more robust ?
these are the kinds of questions we need to face .
and the most profound of all , will we ever be able to develop wisdom , and the wisdom that we need to make that decision ?
in the good way in the evil , and as soon as you might think , these decisions are going to be us .
thank you .
i want you to imagine a little bit , a portable robot that gives you superhuman skills , or a different one that helps the wheel to stand up and go back up .
in berkeley , we call these robots the exotic skeletons .
they &apos;re not different than something that they make in the morning and give them extra strength , and they continue to increase their velocity and will help them for example , for example .
this is indeed the true heat of human and machine .
but not only that -- it deals with the universe and other devices out there .
it &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
now , to show you what we &apos;re working on , we start talking about the american soldiers who carry on average about 100 pounds on his back and it &apos;s the question that they should carry more equipment .
of course , this leads to some major complications -- spinal injuries , 30 percent of it -- chronic spinal cord injury .
so we thought we would embrace this challenge and create an exotic skeleton that would help deal with this problem .
so let me introduce you to karc -- or the human imperative of universal transmission .
soldier : with the hulc skeleton , i can carry 200 pounds across different terrain terrain , many hours long .
his flexible design allows it to go deep , to regenerate , and are highly ambiguous .
it feels what i want to do , where i want to go and then increase my strength and pay away .
we are as far as we can imagine this device , this new exotic skeleton in this year .
so it &apos;s true .
so let &apos;s take a look at the wheelstand driver , something that i &apos;m particularly passionate about .
there are 68 million people who are estimated in the wheelchair .
it &apos;s about one percent of the population .
and that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate .
we &apos;re often talking about very young people with spinal cord injuries , which in the bloteage of their lives -- 20th-century , 44 , 44 -- was hit by the fate , and the wheelchair is the only option .
but it &apos;s also about aging population , whose number is multiplied .
and so pretty much the only option -- if it comes to a brain beat , or some other complications -- is the wheelchair .
and so , by the way , 500 years since his , i &apos;ve been to say , very successful introduction .
so we thought we could start writing a completely new chapter in mobility .
now , let me introduce you to kites that &apos;s carried by amanda boxons , who had a spinal cord , which was a spinal cord injury , which has the result that she couldn &apos;t walk since 19 years and now .
thank you .
as i said , amanda carries our elegangs .
it has sensors .
his completely non-invasive sensors in the strack , the signals back to our onboard computers , which is here on their back .
here are also batter-packs , which is motor drive on their hills , as well as they move on their feet , they move forward in that rather smooth and very natural backgrounds .
i was 24 years old , and in the most best form , when a monet pure tree was a ski tree during a ski ride .
in a fraction of a second , i lost every feeling and every movement underneath my tracks .
not long after that , a doctor in my hospital and he said , &quot; amanda , you can never go back . &quot;
and this was 19 years ago .
he &apos;s a five-legged hope of my consciousness .
adaptable technologies have been able to meet me , to ski again , to climb and actually drive to the hands .
but nothing was invented that would let me go back to now .
thank you .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to meet and argue with them .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we have the whole potential here to change life from future generations -- not just for the soldiers , or for amanda here and all the escalations , but for everyone .
thank you .
at home in new york , i &apos;m boss of the development department of a nonprofit organization called robin hood .
if i don &apos;t owe the poverty to poverty , i fought as a fireheadquarters of a fireman in a volunteer .
now , in our city , in the volunteers , a high-trained professional crisis , you have to be very early on the brand to be able to mix .
i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunteer of the brand , so i had a pretty good chance to get into it .
but it was still a memory of the other volunteers to reach the authorities in the world and find out what our jobs would be .
when i found the main man , he was just in a very serious conversation with the janitors who certainly had one of the worst days of their life .
it was in the middle of the night and she stood in the sleeping train and barfoot under a screen outside in the blames , while her house stood in flames .
the other volunteers who arrived in front of me -- let &apos;s call him lex luther -- reached the main man first and was asked to go into the house and save the dog &apos;s dog &apos;s house .
the dog ! i was a black accident .
there was any lawyer or wealth of wealth , which is now for the rest of his life , telling people that he was able to save a living house , just because he was five seconds faster than i was .
well , i was the next one .
the main man winded me .
he said , &quot; aw , you have to go to the house .
you have to go up to the top of the fire , and you have to get this woman a few shoes . &quot;
i swear it .
now , not exactly what i &apos;d like to hope , but i went out -- the trebs up , the curr , on the &quot; real firemen , &quot; which are already quite finished at this point , in the bedroom around a few shoes .
i know what you &apos;re thinking , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i had my prey back down to the front door , where i met my enemy and my beloved dog .
we put our assets out to the house of the house , where , not surprisingly , he got more attention than my .
a couple of weeks later , the fireguard was got a letter of the janitors , where they used to use it for the box of saving their house .
one of the most valued kindness : somebody had brought her a pair of shoes .
both in my job at robin hood , and in my side profession as a volunteer fireman , i &apos;m a witness of generosity and kindness in big scale , but i also see the inspiration and the muts of individuals .
and you know what i learned ?
they &apos;re all important .
so if i look around in this room and see people who have either been able to succeed , or are there on their way , i want to offer this memory : wait not .
you don &apos;t wait to make a difference in your life , until you &apos;ve reached your first million .
if you give something to something , you give it it now .
use them in a kitchen kitchen , rooms in the neighborhood .
be a mentor .
not every day will give us an opportunity to save life of a human being , but every day gives us the opportunity to change one .
so they sit down ; save the shoes .
thank you .
bruno guissani : mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
i just come back from a community that knows the secret of humanity .
a place where women are going to lead to the delegation , with sex &apos; hello , and the game determines the day -- where fun is serious .
and no , it &apos;s not liverman or san francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , their relatives .
this is the world of the wild bonobos of congo .
bonobos are together with chimpanzees our next living relatives .
that means we have a common ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother , which lived about six million years ago .
well , chimpanzees are known for their more aggressive selves .
but unfortunately , we have this aspect of the narrative of human evolution .
but bonobos show us the other side of the medal .
as chimpanzees , of great fear , the feminine society will be led by empowerment of empowerment .
they really have what came from , because this leads to a very heavily tolerance society that has not been observed in the lethal violence .
but unfortunately , bonobos are least known among the primates .
they live in the deep of the congolese empire , and they &apos;re just difficult to observation .
congo is a paradox -- a country of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of the darkness itself -- the place of a violent argument that has been challenged for decades and so many lives as the first world war .
it &apos;s not surprising that these destruction also suffer to the bonobos .
meat and the decrease of the tree is that you can &apos;t even fill it in a stadium with the elevated bonobos -- and even there we are not sure to be honest .
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a hidden smile that the trees shattered .
who are these relatives ?
we know it as &quot; love instead of war &quot; monkeys , because they have a common gene , also bisexous sex , with intermediate partners , and rules like that .
i &apos;m not saying that this would be the ultimate answer to all humanitarian problems -- because life &apos;s life is more than more than the camel a sutra .
bonobos -- like humans -- love , their life for play .
play doesn &apos;t just mean children &apos;s games .
for us and it &apos;s a game essential to the attachment of relationships and care of tolerance .
we &apos;re learning and the rules of the game .
play is increasing creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s all about the production of diversity -- diversity -- diversity , diversity , diversity , diversity .
and when you observe bonobos in play , you see the evolutionary origins of human lail , dance and rituals .
play is the tickt that stops us .
well , i don &apos;t know how they play , but i want to show you a few unique photographs from the wild .
first of all , a balloon game -- and i don &apos;t think of football .
so here we &apos;re looking at a young female and males in a tracking game .
look at what makes them .
this could be the evolutionary origin of &quot; you put it on the eggs . &quot;
just that i think it &apos;s more like it , not true .
yes !
so sex games are spread , both with bonobos and people .
and this video is really interesting , because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows the ideality , with which you bring new elements into play -- like the teteks and also , as the game -- and also , the game , both trust as well as it does .
but the game is a shape-chanter .
play is a shape-chanter , and it can take a lot of shapes , some of which are slightly quiet , fake , curious -- maybe to discover the amazing one again .
and i want to show you , this is fusion , a young female , and she plays peace with water .
i think , just like you &apos;re playing , sometimes you &apos;re playing , and we have lots limitations of our inner and external worlds .
and it &apos;s this playful curiosity that makes us explore , and interact . and the unexpected connections that we create are the real food of creativity .
this is just a little preconvenience on the insights that bonobos give us into our past and present .
but they also have a secret for our future , a future where we have to adapt to serious challenges , through greater creativity and prints .
the secret is that the game of the key to these skills is .
in other words , play is our adaptive .
so in order to adapt to us , we have to adapt to an unconsistent world .
but are we going to make the best of our game drive ?
play is not silly .
it &apos;s essential .
for bonobos and people equally , life doesn &apos;t matter from teeth and claws alone .
just when it &apos;s barely appropriate , it may be the most powerful thing .
and so , my colleagues , my colleagues , let &apos;s hug this gift of evolution and play together , while we discover creativity and the wonder .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two pairs , in 1979 , at the same same day , in exactly the same moment , each one is a baby -- okay .
so two pairs , each one is a baby .
now i don &apos;t want you to spend too much time using the creation , because when you imagine all the time , you &apos;re not going to listen to me .
imagine just for a moment .
and in this scenario , you imagine that in a case , the puma is wearing a y chomomatic that hit the x chromosome of the ice cell .
and in the other case , the puma is a x chromosome hitting the x chromosome of the ice cell .
both of these are survival , both light .
we come back to these people later .
in most of my activities i have two hats .
under a hat , i &apos;m involved with the story of anatomy .
i &apos;m an historian , and in this case , i study how people went around with anatomy -- that human body , animal body -- as they went with body fluids , with body pulses , as they were thinking about bodies .
the other hat i carried in my work is the activist , as patients -- or as i sometimes say , as an impatient lawyers -- of people who are patients who are patients .
in this case , i worked with people who have the body types , the social standards in question .
so for example , i worked with people who are siamese twins , two people in a body .
i grew up working with people -- so people who were smaller than usual .
and very often i worked with intersexual people whose gender is -- so people who don &apos;t have the average male or female body types .
and as usual , we can use the word of intersexual sexuality .
intersexuality comes in many different forms .
i &apos;m just going to give you a few examples of the possible guys that are not equal to the male or female standard .
in one case , you may have someone with a proxy chromosome , and that &apos;s the sry of the y chomosoms that we &apos;re all carrying , to use fetal stage all of the time .
and that &apos;s why the controls in the woods are giving testosterone .
but because this individual is missing the receptors to recognize testosterone , doesn &apos;t respond to the body .
and this is called androtization bug .
so a lot of testosterone , but no reaction to that .
as a consequence , the body evolves more the typical female course .
if the kid is born , she looks like a girl .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s raised as a girl .
but it takes most of them to get puberty and grow their breasts and develop them , but they don &apos;t get their period until someone comes out there .
and they do a couple of tests and find out that instead of ice sticks and uterans , they actually wear tein and that they have a y chromosome .
it &apos;s important to understand that you could actually think of this person , but they &apos;re not really .
women , like men , in our bodies have something called adrenalinwatsen .
they are in the back part of our body .
and the side kidneys make androgenic , which are vital hormones .
most women , like me -- i think a typical woman -- i don &apos;t know my actual chromosomes , but i think i probably have the typical -- most women like me actually talk to androgenic .
we produce androgen and we talk to androgenic .
the consequence is that somebody like me actually has a brain that had more androgenic than a woman who has been born with tegs and a androreceptor bug .
so gender is really complicated ; intersexual seats are not just in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in a sense , they can be spread over the whole range .
another example : a few years ago , i received the call of a 19 year-old man who was born as a boy , he had a friend , he had sex with his girlfriend , had sex with his girlfriend , and he had just found that he had an mp3 and a uteran .
he had a very extreme form of an innate side breece .
he has xx chromosome , and in the womb , his side kidneys were so active that they created a male hormone environment .
and as a consequence , his genital male , his brain was exposed to the greater male part of the hormone spectrum .
and when he was born , he looked like a boy -- no one had anything .
and only when he was 19 years old , he got enough medical problems , actually , because he was at the inside that the doctors found that he was inside the inner female .
okay , just a quick example of an intersexual contribution .
some people with xx chromosomes , they develop something called the ozone fish , where eieran tissue is swamp .
we don &apos;t know why this is happening .
so gender can occur in many different varieties .
the reason why children with this kind of body -- whether it &apos;s grown , or siamesic twins , it &apos;s intersexually related -- are often adapted by surgeons , not because this would be the norm for their physical health .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
the reason why they have done different kinds of surgical intervention is because they &apos;re endangered of our social categories .
typically , our system on the idea that a certain anatomic audence is going to be linked to a particular identity .
so we have the concept that to be a woman , is to have a female identity ; a black person is meant to have an african anatomy in terms of its own story .
so we have this awful simple idea .
and if we &apos;re faced with a body that actually represents something very different for us , it &apos;s confused us in terms of this framework .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas about individualism .
and our nation is really on a very romantic concept of individualism .
now you can imagine how amazing it is when kids are born , who are two people in a body .
where i &apos;ve seen most of the excitement in the last time , the south african nests was caster &apos;s sester last year , whose gender was asked to question the sex sex world championship in berlin .
many journalists called me the question : &quot; what are you going to do , who tells us if caster semenya is female or male ? &quot;
and i had to explain to the journalists that there aren &apos;t that test .
now , we know that gender is complicated enough that we have to admit that nature is not pulling us a line between male and female and sub-and interspecies ; touch and interspecies ; touch it as , of course , we have that line line .
so we have such a situation where , the further our science advances , we have to stand around so much more , that these categories that we had for stable anatomic categories , which were very simple to make these very simple policies in order to create permanent identity , are much inextenated than we did .
and that &apos;s not just about gender .
it &apos;s also true of race , which turns out to be much more complicated than our terminology has approved .
in our cases , we found out in all kinds of unheated areas .
for example , we go to the fact that we have at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees .
what are we supposed to do with the fact that we just differ from a few nuclear tide ?
as we continue to move our science forward , we get increasingly into a zone of the naked , where we have to recognize that the simplistic categories we had probably are too simple .
we see this in all sorts of different areas of human life .
one of the areas that we &apos;re seeing in this , in our modern culture , in the united states today , are the struggle over the beginning and the end of life .
we have difficult conversations about what a body is going to be for people , so that he has another right than the fetal life .
we have very difficult conversations today -- maybe not as public as in medicine -- over the question , when someone is dead .
our ancestors used to have been struggling with the question of when someone was dead .
you &apos;ve had somebody hold a feack on the nose , and if you moved , you haven &apos;t buried it yet .
if you weren &apos;t moving , you &apos;ve buried it .
but today we are in a situation where we are taking people &apos;s vital organs and they want to reproduce other people .
and as a result , we start with the struggle with the really difficult question when someone is dead , and that brings us into a really difficult situation that we don &apos;t have as simple categories as before .
now you might think that the whole thing would break out of categories somebody like me really happy .
i &apos;m politically progressive , i travel people with unusual bodies , but i have to admit it makes me nervous .
to understand that these categories are really much more insecure than we thought , well , i think that &apos;s a lot tense .
and it makes me engage in terms of the challenge of democracy .
so to tell you about this tension , i have to first know that i &apos;m a big fan of the founding fathers .
i know they were ruxied , i know they were seximost , but they were great .
i think that they were so taff and strong , and so radical , in which what they did is i &apos;m going to look at all the few years in the room , and it &apos;s not because of music , which is absolutely to forget .
it &apos;s what happened 1776 with the founding fathers .
so the founding fathers were made of my view of anatomic activists , and that &apos;s why .
what it was behind was an anatomical concept , and they made it through a different , which was radical and beautiful , and 200 years for us .
as you all remember , our founding fathers took the concept of monarchy , and the monarchy based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy .
the glory of the old world had no concept based on dna , but they had a concept of birth .
they had a concept of blue blood .
they were the notion that people who had political power had to have this political power , because of the wounded blood line of the grandfather to son and so on .
the founding fathers smiled this idea back and made them through a new anatomic concept , and this concept said that all human beings were created in the same way .
they make the play field , and they decided that anatomically , the similarities , they didn &apos;t care about the differences , and that was very radical .
now they did this part because they were part of an educational system where two things grew together .
democracy grew up , but at the same time , science grew up .
if you look at the story of the founding fathers , it &apos;s clear that many of you were very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of an naturalist world .
they went away from explanations , and meadows , like a supernatural concept of power , back where the transmission of the birth of birth is based on a very vade paradigm .
they moved to a natural paradigm .
and if you look at the independence of independence , you talk about nature and the god of nature .
they &apos;re not talking about god and nature .
they talk about nature &apos;s power to tell us who we are .
and as part of that , they created a concept of anatomic similarities .
and in fact , they &apos;ve prepared a really wonderful way of future citizenship .
they didn &apos;t think about it , but what they &apos;ve done for us was great .
so what happened after that ?
for example , women who used the election right , the concept of the founding fathers that says that anatomic commons is more important than the anatomic difference , and said , &quot; that we have a utera and protein as a matter of the fact that we don &apos;t have to have the right , etc . , etc . &quot;
and women argued that .
next , the successful civil rights movement , where we were looking for people how souminesner , who were talking about it , &quot; am i not a woman ? &quot;
we find men in march rows of lawwarming movement , saying , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , people different color , the different skin of anatomic similarities , again , successful differences .
we see the same thing at the disabled law movement .
of course , the problem is that , as we begin to look at all the similarities , we need to begin to question why we have certain beekeepers .
well , prosperity , i want to keep certain beekeepers , anatomically , in our culture .
for example , i don &apos;t want to give the same rights to a fish like a human .
i don &apos;t want to say that we should take away from the anatomy .
i don &apos;t want to say that 5-year-old should have the right , you should get to sex or get married .
so there are some anatomical beekeepers that make sense for me , and that , i think , should keep .
but the challenge is to try and figure out what it is and why we keep them , and whether they &apos;re useful .
so let &apos;s come back to these two creatures that have been observed at the beginning of the talk .
we &apos;ve looked at two creatures , both the middle of 1979 at the same time .
let &apos;s imagine that one of them was born maria , three months old , so she &apos;s born on june 1980 .
heinrich , on the other side , will be born , so he &apos;s born on march 1980 .
just because of the fact that maria 3 months has been born , they get all kinds of three months before heinrich -- the right to have sex , to choose the right to drink .
heinrich needs to wait for all this , not because he actually has another biological age because of the time of his birth .
we find other strange ties in what their rights is .
heinrich , because you assume that he &apos;s male -- although i don &apos;t tell you that he &apos;s the sex -- because you think he &apos;s male , he can be moved now , what maria doesn &apos;t have to worry about .
maria , it can &apos;t be seen in all states the same thing that the heinrich in all states has , and that &apos;s the right to marry .
heinrich can marry a woman in every state , but maria can only marry a woman in a few states .
so we have these permanent anatomic categories that are problematic and questionable .
and for me , the question is : what are we going to do , because our science is making such progress in the field of anatomy that we have to achieve a point where we have to admit that a democracy that is based on anatomy ?
i don &apos;t want to give up science , but at the same time , it feels like the science is self-constantly .
so where do we go ?
it seems like our culture would take a kind of pragmatic posture : &quot; well , we need to move somewhere , so we have to pull them somewhere . &quot;
but a lot of people will catch up in a very different position .
so for example , texas , in a point , decided to marry a man , that you don &apos;t have y chromosome , and a woman means to marry a y chromosome .
now in practice , people aren &apos;t tested on their chromosomes .
but it &apos;s also very bizarre , because of the story that i &apos;ve been telling you about the androreceptor bug .
if we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us in his &quot; i &apos;m talking a dream . &quot;
he says we shouldn &apos;t be people &apos; skin , but after the property of their character , &quot; judge , &quot; and goes beyond anatomy .
and i want to say , &quot; yes , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
but how do you do that in practice ?
how do you evaluate people based on their character properties ?
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure we &apos;re going to be able to distribute right in people &apos;s rights , because i have to admit that i know a series of golden pads that probably deserve more socials than some people i know .
i want to predict that i probably know some bright laboratories , which are more powerful , intelligent and more mature decisions about their sexual relationships than some 40 years that i know .
so how do we apply the question to the characteristics of the character ?
it turns out to be really hard .
and part of me wonder what if the content of a personality would be something that would be in the future of machine readable -- could be done by mri ?
do we really want to go to this ?
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
what i know is that it really seems really important to think about the idea that the united states is leading to the challenge of democracy .
in our training for democracy , we &apos;ve done a really good thing , and i think we would do well in the future .
we don &apos;t have the situation , like it &apos;s in iran in the case , where a man who feels sexually to other men , with death , will be punished , because he &apos;s ready to be an athlete in the case where he can stay alive .
the states of this kind of stuff exist in us .
i &apos;m glad to be able to say that we don &apos;t have these conditions -- a surgeon that i talked about a few years ago , which had brought a few siamese twins to separate them , partly to make a name .
but when i was flying with him , and asked him why he was doing it -- it was high at the top surgeries -- his answer was that in his country , these kids would be very poor , and so he had to do it .
i told him , &quot; well , did you consider political asylin instead of a surgery to separate it ? &quot;
the united states spends incredible opportunities to allow people to be the ones that they are without changing the state of state .
so i think we need to be leaders .
well , just to finish , i want to realize that i &apos;ve talked a lot about the fathers .
and i want to think about the ways that democracy might look like , or looked at , if we had the mothers involved more .
and i want to say something that is kind of radical for a feminist , and i think that there might be different kinds of insight , which of different kinds of anatomy , especially when people think of a group .
since years , because i was interested in intersexuality , i &apos;ve also been interested in research in the field of gender .
and one of the things i really found interesting is the difference between men and women in terms of how they think and operate in the world .
what we &apos;ve learned from cultural surplus studies is that women , in average -- not every , but in average -- tend to be more complex social relationships and the care of people who are vulnerable within the group , a lot of attention .
and so , if we think about it , we have an interesting situation .
years ago , when i got to graduate school , one of my students asked me , who knew my interest in feminism -- i looked at myself as a feminist , so i &apos;m going to do it .
he said , &quot; tell me what the feminine female is . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s the most stupid question i &apos;ve ever heard .
feminism is about controlling about gender , so feminism is nothing female .
but the more i thought about his question , so i thought that there might be something female in feminism .
this is supposed to be something that could give a difference in average , which is the average brain of male brains that make us smart for highly complex social relationships , and awareness for the protection .
so where the founding fathers were extremely controversial to find out how individuals could be protected before the state , it &apos;s possible that if we put more mothers in this concept , we have a concept of it , not just how to protect them , but how we can help for each other .
and maybe it &apos;s where we have to go in the future , if we take democracy out of anatomy -- less thinking about the individual body , and thinking more about relationships .
so , when we try to make a more perfect connection , we think about what we can do for each other .
thank you .
i &apos;m jessi and this is my suitcase .
but before i show you what i have , i &apos;m going to make a very public confession , and that is , i &apos;m obsessed with outfits .
i love to find the opportunity to find a different colorous , crazy outfit , and photograph , in recent times , and to prove to bloggers .
but i buy nothing new .
i &apos;m going to get all my clothes out of the second hand , and in linear settings .
ooh , thank you .
utilities are allowed me to reduce the impact of my garobe on the environment , and also on my money .
i meet all kinds of great people ; my dollars for usually a good purpose ; i look pretty unique ; and it &apos;s going to buy my own personal search .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
is it going to have my size ?
am i going to like the color ?
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
if everybody agrees , i feel like i won .
i come back to my suitcase , and i &apos;m going to tell you what i &apos;ve put up for this exciting week here at ted .
i mean , what does someone do with so many outfits ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought .
i brought seven some underpants , and that &apos;s all .
for exactly a week , it &apos;s all i &apos;ve done in my suitcase .
i have a joke that i wanted everything i wanted to wear , if i &apos;d just come to palm springs .
and you don &apos;t have heard of me as the woman running around here at ted in her underwear -- called this , i found a couple of things .
and i really want to show you my outfits for this week .
sounds good ?
while i do that , i &apos;m also going to give you some of the lessons that i think is if you believe it or not , you &apos;ve learned not to wear anything new .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
i call this the beam tigers .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look good .
you can almost always look great for less than 50 dollars .
this whole outfit , including the jacket , cost me 55 , and it was the most expensive piece that i carried in this whole week .
monday : color is something powerful .
it &apos;s almost a physiologically impossible to be angry if you wear light red pants .
if you &apos;re happy , you take other happy people .
tuesday : customization is completely degraded .
i spent a lot of time trying to try to be myself , and at the same time .
be just who you are .
if you &apos;re surrounded with the right people , you &apos;re not just going to understand it , you &apos;ll also appreciate it .
wednesday : hug your inner child .
sometimes people say i looked like i &apos;m choking &apos; games or that i remember her seven-year-olds .
i &apos;d like to smile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
thursday : confidence is the key .
if you think you &apos;re looking at something good , it &apos;s almost safe .
and if you think you &apos;re not looking good in something , you probably are right .
i grew up with a mother who taught me this day .
but only when i was 30 , i really understood what that means .
and i &apos;m going to summarize that for you soon .
if you think you &apos;re inside and a wonderful person , there &apos;s nothing you can &apos;t wear .
so there &apos;s no excuse for somebody here in this audience .
we should be able to do everything we want .
thank you .
friday : a universal truth -- five words : golden pailletes of everything .
and finally , saturday : a , unique , personal style , is a great way of telling the world about one , without having to say a word .
it was always proven to me and again , when in this week people came to me , just because of what i was wearing , and i had great talks .
obviously , it &apos;s not all in my tiny suitcase .
so before i go home , i &apos;m going to donate it all again .
because the lesson i try to learn this week is that it &apos;s okay to leave .
i don &apos;t have to be emotional , because in the same order of the corner , it &apos;s always going to give a different kind of crazy , colorful , junk of outfit , just waiting for me if i love a little bit in the heart and search for it .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good afternoon , all together .
i have something that i want to show you .
think of this as an imaging point , as flying imaging .
this is what we call our lab , perceptual design .
let me tell you a little bit about it .
now if you take this picture -- i &apos;m originally italian , and every boy in italy grows with this picture in his room , but the reason why i &apos;m showing you this is something very interesting in the last decade .
some time ago , when they wanted to win a formula , they would take their budget and put their money on a good driver and a good car .
and if the car and the driver were good enough , they won the race .
now , these days , if you want to win a race , actually something like this -- something that &apos;s driving the car in real time , some thousand sensors that pass information out of the car , and then re-change things in real time during information .
this would call them in engineering teams , a real-time control system .
and basically , it &apos;s a system that &apos;s made out of two parts -- a specific part and a respond to it .
what &apos;s interesting today is the real-time control systems begin to emerge in our lives .
our cities have been equipped in the last few years with networks and electronics .
they become in the free .
and as a computer in the free , you start to respond to other kinds of ways , you &apos;re being recorded and driven .
if we are cities , that &apos;s actually a big deal .
by the way , i want to mention that cities are only two percent of the world &apos;s land , but 50 percent of the world &apos;s population live there .
they &apos;re 75 percent of the energy consumption -- up to 80 percent of co2 emissions .
so if we do something with the cities , it &apos;s a big thing .
over the world , all of this sense is pulling and driving objects in the daily life .
this is from a show that paola antonelli for moma later in the summer , while the summer , organized .
it &apos;s called &quot; me . &quot;
well , all of our objects , our environment , start to talk to us .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost as if any atom is out there to two , a sensor and a driver .
and that changes radically the interaction we have people with our environment .
in a way , it &apos;s almost like the old dream of michelangelo ...
you know , when michelangelo shaped the moses , does it mean that he took the hammer and he threw him on moses -- in fact , you can still see a little spot -- and said , &quot; perché murdered ? why don &apos;t you carry ? &quot;
now , today , our environment begins for the first time to respond to us .
i &apos;m just going to show you some examples -- again , with the idea of trying to perceive our environment .
let &apos;s start with the understanding .
now the first project i want to introduce to you is actually one of the first of our labs .
it emerged four and a half years ago in italy .
and what we &apos;ve done was actually to use a new kind of network that was used on the whole world -- this is a mobile phone network -- and anonymous information and retaliated information from this network that will be collected by the operators to understand how the city works .
summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
it was as an italy called the foot world championship .
some of you will remember it was an italy on france , and then at the end , the head hit .
and no matter what italy won at the end .
now you look at what happened this day , just watching the activity that happens in the network .
here you see the city .
you can see in the middle of the super sea , the hallway .
on the morning , before play .
you see the timeline up .
early afternoon , people here and there , the phone calls and moving .
the game begins -- silence .
france does a gateway . italy makes a tor .
half-time , people make a short call , go on toilet .
second half-time . end of the normal play time .
first iteration , second extension .
quoting , in a moment of head .
italy wins . yeah .
now , in this night , all the center went to celebrate .
you saw the big outbeat .
the next day , all in the center went to meet the siegerteam and the prime minister at the same time .
and then everybody went down .
you can see the picture of the place circo massimo , where , since the roman time , people go to celebrate -- to have a big party , and you see the outline at the end of the day .
now , this is just an example of how we can feel the city in a way that we couldn &apos;t do it a few years ago .
very quickly , another example of feeling : this is not about people , but to make things that we use and consume .
well , today we know everything about where our things come from .
this is a map that shows you all the chips , which is a mac of computers , as they came together .
but we only know little about where the things go .
so in this project , we &apos;ve actually designed some small markers to track the garbage as it goes through the system .
so we started with some volunteers that we started , something more than a year ago , in seattle , the things that they threw off -- different kinds of things that they would throw away -- different kinds of things they would throw away .
then we have the little chips that stick small brands on the trash and started tracking it .
here are the results we have right now .
from seattle ...
after a week .
with this information we realized there &apos;s a lot of inefficications in the system .
we can do the same stuff in fact with less energy .
the data was not available before .
but that &apos;s a lot of unuseful transport , and more complicated things .
but the other thing is , we believe that if we see every day , the cup that we throw away , don &apos;t just disappear that it &apos;s still somewhere on the planet somewhere .
and the plastic bottle we just throw away every day .
and if we show the people , we can move a change change .
so this is the reason for this project .
my colleague at mit , assaf biderman , could give you a lot more about the experience and a lot of other wonderful things that you can do with you , and i want to talk to you about the second part of it , and that &apos;s the direction of our environment .
and the first project is something that we did a few years ago in zaragoza , spain .
it started with a question of the citizen , who came to us and said that spain and south ambiguity have a beautiful tradition , in public places as part of the architecture .
and the question was : how could you do technology , new technology with it ?
and one of the ideas that had been done at mit was , you know , imagine these little bits , and valves , magnetic valves , magnetic valves , that open and close .
it &apos;s something that &apos;s going to be like a water bias with data points .
if these courses fall down , they can write patterns , they can write patterns , images , text ads .
and you can approach it , and it &apos;s going to open up to allow you to jump through that picture .
now , we presented the mayor hole .
it really loved him .
and we got the commission to design a building at the orphanage .
we called it the digital water pavion .
the whole building had water .
there &apos;s no doors or windows , but if you approach it , it will open up and it will .
the roof was covered with water as well .
and if it &apos;s windig , if you want to reduce the syringes , you can even let the roof down .
or you could close the building , and the whole architecture , as in this case , you know , this day , when you go down the roof , you get pictures of people who were there and say , &quot; you &apos;ve destroyed the building . &quot;
no , they didn &apos;t destroy the building ; it &apos;s just that architecture almost disappears .
here you see the building works .
you see the person who asks what happens inside the inside .
and here you see me when i was trying to test the sensors that opened water , not getting wet .
now , i should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working .
but actually , it was a greater fun night .
all the kids from zaragoza came to the building , because the way they were playing with the building was very different .
no longer a building that would open up to leave you , but a building that still had pause and holes in the water , you had to jump without getting wet .
and that was , for us , very exciting , because as architects , engineers , as designers , we always think about how people use things that we design .
but reality is always unpredictable .
and that &apos;s the beauty of creating things that are used and interact with people .
so here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical dots , the data dots from water and the projections .
and this is what brought us to think about the following project i &apos;m going to show you now .
imagine these things could really start to fly .
imagine if you could have little helicopter that fly through the air , and every one of you with a little theme point with intermediate light -- almost like a cloud that can move through the space .
here &apos;s the video .
imagine a helicopter that you saw that moves with others , completely in synchrony .
you can have this cloud .
you can have a kind of flexible screen or display , like these -- a smooth formation in two dimensions .
or unregularly , in three dimensions , which is what changes , the light is not the position of imagery .
you can play with different kinds of things .
imagine the screen could just appear in different formats or sizes , in different ways .
but then the whole thing could be just a 3d cloud of imagery that you can go to and move through them , looking at them from many , many directions .
so here you see a real flyfire-engineering controller that comes down to form as a gene as a result .
if you turn on the light , it looks like this . so , as we saw it before .
imagine that every single one of people is being operated .
it could have a impulse to have a momentum that comes from people , from the movements of people or whatever .
i want to show you something here .
we worked with robert to bolle , one of the best ballet dancers of our time -- the étoil on the metropolitan theater in new york and the scala in maan -- we took his movement in 3d to use her as a momentum for the flyfire .
here you see robert to dance .
on the left side , you see the data points , the different insights .
at the same time , it &apos;s a real-time 3d scan and a movement recording .
so you can feel the whole movement .
you can do that all the time .
but then , once we have all the data points , you can play and play with color and play motion .
that &apos;s what we want to use as a possible impulse for the flyfire .
i want to show you the latest project we &apos;re working on .
it &apos;s something that we &apos;re working on for the olympics in london .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
and the idea is , again , imagine that this is what we &apos;re doing again with people to do something and change the environment -- almost like we call it , to build cloud motion like you can &apos;t move a check , but with a cloud .
imagine that everybody can give a little donation for a point .
i think that &apos;s the remarkable part of what &apos;s happening last decades , the last decades , that we have changed from a physical world to a digital world .
this has digitized everything , knowledge , and it goes through the internet .
today , we can take the first time -- and the campaign has shown this -- we can get from the digital world , from the digital forces of the networks to the physical world .
that can be in our case that we use it to design and create a symbol .
that means something that &apos;s built in the city .
but tomorrow , it can be to give us the challenges -- think of climate change or co2 emissions -- as we can then move from the digital world to the physical .
so the idea is that we actually engage people with , in which they do things together , collective .
the cloud again is a cloud of data in the same way that a real cloud is a cloud of particles .
and these particles are water , as our cloud is a cloud of data points .
it &apos;s a physical form in london , but with data points .
you can move inside and make different kinds of experiences .
you can actually look at it from the bottom , the most important moments for olympic 2012 and darfur , and use it as a kind of connection to the community .
so both the physical cloud in the sky and something that you can go to at the top , like londons new mountain summit .
you can go in .
and a kind of digital settlement in the night -- but as the most important , a new kind of experience for everybody who wants to go to the top .
thank you .
as an artist , i became very important .
through my work , i &apos;m trying to express that people are not separate from nature and that everything is connected .
the first time i was in antarctica was 10 years ago , where i saw my first ice mountains .
i got awe .
my heart rasts , i was gridelig , while i tried to grab what was going on .
the ice mountains around me had 60 feet from the water , and i could only wonder that this was a snowflake on a different snow , year after year .
ice mountains are born as a squid of a glacier or by breaking out of ice sheets .
every ice mountain has its own individual personality .
they interact in ways with their environment and their experiences .
some of them are willing to give up and braws to the bitter end , whereas others don &apos;t stand up and put it together in a dramatic case .
if you look at an ice mountain , you just think they &apos;re isolated , separately , and just like we see people often .
but the truth is far away from it .
as a iceberg , i melt his preference atmosphere .
during the ice mountain , it meles mineral water fresh water , a lot of life forms .
i &apos;m going to go back to my photographs of this ice mountains when i was going to make portraits of my ancestors in the mind that they exist in these individual eye moments , and never again .
it &apos;s not a death , if you melt ; it &apos;s not the end , but it &apos;s an ongoing of your pathways along the way .
part of the ice in the ice mountains that i &apos;m thriving is very young -- a few thousand years old .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
the last couple of pictures i &apos;d like to show you is an icberg that i put in biskertsiak in greenland .
very rarely , you &apos;re actually witnessing a wheel iceberg .
here you see it now .
on the left , you see a little boat .
this is about five feet long .
please watch the shape of the iceberg and where it is in the water line .
you can see here , he starts to roll , and the boat moved to the other side , the man stands there .
this is the average size of a greenland iceberg .
he &apos;s about 120 feet from the water , or 40 feet .
and this video is in real time .
and just like that , the iceberg show you a different side of his personality .
thank you .
my life is really extraordinarily blessed by doing some amazing projects .
but the coolest thing i &apos;ve ever been working on was this guy .
his name is knide .
kniw was one of the leading graffiti artist &apos; 80s .
then , one day , he came back from walking back and said , &quot; paps , my legs emanate . &quot;
and that was the outbreak of the outbreak .
this is completely paralyzed today .
he can only use his eyes .
i stood on him .
so i have a company that makes design and animation , so it &apos;s inevitably a complex part of what we admire in the arts and pay attention .
so we decided , tony -- kniw -- and his thing to support .
i met with his father and his brother , and he said , &quot; we &apos;ll give you this money .
what will you do with this ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk to tony .
i just want to talk to him and i said , &quot; wait a minute , isn &apos;t that -- i saw stephen hawking -- can &apos;t communicate all the paralyzed people using this stuff ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , only if you listen to higher social layer and have a remarkable insurance , you can really do that .
ordinary people are not available to these devices . &quot;
and i said , &quot; how do you communicate now ? &quot;
does anybody see the film &quot; butterfly and deaf bell ? &quot;
so they communicate -- so their fingers walk along .
i mean , &quot; very archaic , how can that be ? &quot;
so i came up with the need , just to put out a check , and instead , i put a check out of the way i didn &apos;t know how to fix it .
i commit to place , and my brother and his father -- with the words , &quot; well , my proposal is like , tony &apos;s going to be talking , we &apos;ll get him a device and we &apos;ll find a way that he can make his art .
because it &apos;s a farce that someone who &apos;s wearing all this , it cannot communicate . &quot;
so i talked to a few months later at a conference .
i met these people from atrol , graffiti research lab , and they have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface , and then draw with a laser pointer that will only determine the negative surface .
so they pull around and do art installations like this .
they say that all the things that are going on up there is a life cycle .
it starts with the sex , then the words are the words , and then the bush hurts , and they actually make art .
but there was always a life cycle in your presentation .
so i went home and ate with my wife , and i told her about everything , and we thought , &quot; well , second , second , if there &apos;s this technology that you can use with your eyes to control things , then we should find a way to control things , so that that would be true . &quot;
that was the beginning of the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , a year later , and a lot of organization , we &apos;ve achieved some things .
first of all , we have the insurance curves the doors , and in fact , you get a device that he can communicate with -- an stephen hawd machine .
that was incredible .
and he &apos;s really terribly funny -- i call him yoda , because you talk to him , or get an email , and i think , &quot; i &apos;m so unworthy , this guy is incredible . &quot;
we also flew seven programmers around the world -- literally from all the world &apos;s corners -- to us home .
my wife , my children and i are moved to garage , and these hackers and programmers and conspiracy have taken our house over .
many of our friends thought we were beautiful stupid to do and that we were coming back and all the images on the walls would be graffiti .
but for about two weeks , we have programmed , we went to the beach of venice , my children became involved , my dog , and we created this .
it &apos;s called eyewriter and you can see the description .
this is a cheap sunglasses that we bought on the beach of venice , something copper wire and a few things from the building market and the electric trade .
we took a rebel camera , and you put it apart , put it on a red light , and now we have a device that &apos;s open -- you can build it yourself , we make the code free for free to download software free .
so we have created a device that is completely free of constraints .
no insurance can make up .
no hospital too .
every paralyzed can actually communicate alone with his eyes or draw .
thank you .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to temple room .
i love this picture because it &apos;s somebody else &apos;s room , and that &apos;s his room .
now , there &apos;s all this dive in front of the great unveiling .
and after over a year of planning , two weeks of programming work , nudelparties and running seams , they drew tony to seven years after seven years .
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and he looks beyond his life support system .
we mucked his bed so he can see out .
we put a projector set up against a wall of space in front of the hospital .
and he drew back to the first time in his family and friends -- and you can only imagine what a feeling that was on the parking lot .
we also had to break into the parking lot , so we felt as a part of the spray scene .
at the end of the sand he gave us an email with the content , &quot; for the first time , i &apos;ve drawn something .
i feel that i was covered under water , and finally someone went down and pulled up my head so i can breathe . &quot;
isn &apos;t that overwhelming ?
this is something like our fight .
that &apos;s keeping us on the shelf and we keep going on .
and we have to make a better deal on this device .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s a magic chart right now .
and somebody who has such an artistic potential , so much more .
so we &apos;re trying to figure out how to make it better , faster and stronger .
since that time , we have all sorts of recognition .
we won a couple of awards .
remember , it &apos;s free , none of us deserve it .
it &apos;s all coming from our own pockets .
so the drawings were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
armstrong twitter was talking about us and then , in december , the time magazine was honored when one of the 50 best inventions in 2010 was what was really great .
the coolest thing about it -- and that includes the whole circle -- that it will give this april to april in the inner city of los angeles , called &quot; art of the streets . &quot;
and there will be so much the toughest practitioners of the street scene -- banking , shesy , shews -- all these guys will be there .
kniw is going to be part of the show , which is pretty annoying .
so basically , i &apos;m about to say , if you see something that is impossible , then it can make possible .
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this microphone , the eyewriter -- everything was impossible .
make it possible -- you all here .
i &apos;m not a programmer , and i &apos;ve never had anything to do with augue technology , but i just captured something and put me around with amazing people so we could put something on the legs .
and this question should be each of you , and every single day , where you recommend something that needs to be done , if not now , when do you ? and if not me , who ?
thank you .
so , i write for kids , and i &apos;m probably america &apos;s most popular children &apos;s book author .
and i always tell people that i don &apos;t want to come like a scientist .
you can have me as a farmer , or in leather , but nobody has ever chosen farmers .
today i want to tell you about circles and openances .
well , an epiphany is usually something that you find , because you &apos;ve left it somewhere .
you go around the block and it was a revelation .
this is a painting of a circle .
one of my friends has done it -- richard bollywood .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle that i &apos;d like to share with you today .
my circle started back in the &apos; 60s at high school in stow , ohio , where i was the classroom .
i was the one who was beaten up every week in the toilet toilet and blue , until a teacher saved my life .
she saved my life by using the toilet in the teacher &apos;s room .
that &apos;s what they did .
she did it for three years .
and i had to go out of the city .
i had a thumb , i had 85 dollars , and it proposed to san francisco in california -- i found a lover -- and then in the &apos; 80s , i found a work in aids organizations .
about three or four years ago , i received a call in the middle of this teacher , woman who said , &quot; i have to see it .
i &apos;m sad that we &apos;ve never learned each other as adults .
can you come to ohio , and please come together with the man i know you &apos;ve found it now .
and i should mention that i &apos;ve been building , and i want to say that i want you to ask yourself . &quot;
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
we saw them , we laughed , we laughed , and we knew they &apos;d be in a hospice .
we found one for them , we took them , and we were pushing them , and we gave them eight , because it needed to be necessary .
it was something we knew to do .
and just as the woman who wanted to know me as adults , met me , she turned to a box full of box , and was put in my hands .
what happened was that the circle had closed , it had become a circle -- and the revelation of that i talked about .
the revelation is that death is part of life .
she saved my life , and my partner and i saved her .
and you know , this part of life needs everything the rest of life needs .
he needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so happy that this is so often mentioned today .
he needs the same -- he would need , love and pleasure . and it &apos;s about giving these things .
thank you .
imagine a big explosion while you &apos;re on 1,000 feet .
imagine an airplane full of smoke .
imagine a driver &apos;s engine , the blade of sound , barack , blade , spiack , spiack , spiack .
that sounds scary .
well , i had a unique place that day ; i sat on 1d .
i was the only one who could talk to the airport .
so i looked at it , and they said , &quot; no problem , we &apos;ve probably got some birds . &quot;
the pilot had already turned on the machine , and we weren &apos;t so far away .
you could see manhattan .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
the pilot took the machine to the hudson river .
it &apos;s usually not the route .
it turns the engine off .
imagine a sound plane .
and then he said three words -- the best words i &apos;ve ever heard of .
he says , &quot; make up for all of you . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the borddies .
i could see it in your eyes because it was horror to the end .
i want to share with you three things that i &apos;ve learned on this day .
i learned that in a moment , everything else is different .
we have this live plan , we have these things that we want to do in life , and i thought about all the people i wanted to get a hand and didn &apos;t do , all the fences i wanted to do , and never did .
while i was thinking about it later , a saying was , &quot; i collect bad wireless . &quot;
because if the wine is so far and the person is there , then i open it .
i never want to move more into life .
and that urgency , this goal , really changed my life .
the second thing i learned on this day -- and that was , when we did the george washington bridge , so much around hair -- i thought , man , there &apos;s one thing i really regret .
i had a good life .
in my own humanity , and with my mistakes , i went out to become better in everything i grabbed .
but in my humanity , i &apos;ve also given my ego space .
and i took the time that i wasted things for meaningful things , with people who mean something .
and i thought about the relationship with my wife , to friends .
and after that , when i thought about it , i decided to wire negative energy from my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
i didn &apos;t talk to my wife for two years .
it feels great .
i &apos;m not trying to have anymore ; i choose to be happy .
the third thing i learned -- and while the inner clock begins , it says , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 , ... &quot;
you can see the water .
i said , &quot; please go to the air . &quot;
i don &apos;t want this thing to break into 20 parts , as you know it from a documentary .
as we drop off , i had this feeling , human , dying is not terrifying .
almost as if we prepare our lives for it .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and that sadness really came up with a thought that i just wanted one thing .
i just wish i could see my kids grow up .
about a month after i went to visit my daughter &apos;s performance -- first graders , not much artistic talent ...
not yet .
and i cook , i write like a little kid .
and in the world , everything made sense for me .
i realized that when i connected the dots with each other , it &apos;s just about being a great father .
more than anything , everything else is my only goal to be a good father .
i became part of the wonder of dying that day .
i received another gift , which is to see the future , and come back and live differently .
my call to everybody who flies today is : do you imagine the same thing on your flight -- don &apos;t you -- but imagine it , and how would you change ?
what would you do , because you think they &apos;re always there ?
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in it ?
and more than anything else , are they the best parents they can only be ?
thank you .
the idea behind the pc computer worm is pretty simple .
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bomb .
the most important post for the development of nuclear weapons is the dominant incentive institution in nato .
the gray boxes that you see here , these are real-time control systems .
now , when it gets to us , the systems to compress , which control and valves control , then we can actually create a lot of problems with the centrifuge .
these gray boxes don &apos;t run with wincal software ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
but if we can do it that a more effective wave virus is being used by a laptop engineer , which is used by a wareengineer engineer , then we &apos;re in business .
and that &apos;s the planning behind lunch .
so we start with a windmill dropper .
the amount of data is in the gray box , damage to the centrifuge and the iranian nuclear energy program -- mission done .
this is a child game , right ?
i want to tell you how we found that .
when we started to graduate our research six months ago , it was completely unknown , which was the sense and purpose of this construction .
the only thing that we knew is very , very complicated , which is in terms of the windmill , the drone part , and he made it off of all of a long time .
and it seemed to have something to do with these gray boxes , these real-time control systems .
it was the genesis of our attention , and we started a lab project where we have our environment with stuxnet infected , and we studied this constructed .
and then something funny happened .
stuxnet stopped like a laboratory rat who didn &apos;t like our cheese -- sniffed , but didn &apos;t want to eat it .
that didn &apos;t make sense in my eyes .
and after we were experimenting with different types of cheese experimentation , i went to that this is a target attack .
completely on a particular goal .
the dropper reactive on the gray box , when a special configuration was discovered , even if the special program , which is trying to get infected in this goal .
and if not , you don &apos;t do it .
so , that really , really , really my interest and we started working , almost around the clock , because i thought we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
it could say , for example , a us- american power power , or a chemical plant in germany .
so we should better figure out what the goal is .
so we extrahired and decompass , and we found the attacks code and found that it &apos;s reconstructed in two digital warheads -- a smaller and bigger one .
and we also realized that they were very professionally designed by people who had obviously all had information available .
they knew any bits and byks they had to attack .
you probably knew the shoe size of the machine interface .
so they knew everything .
and if you &apos;ve got that drug dropper &apos;s complex and high-tech , let me tell you : the data data is a science for itself .
it &apos;s much more sophisticated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
here you see a clip out of this attack -- code .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 lines code .
looks pretty much like old-fashioned humidity language .
and i want to tell you how we were able to be smart from this code .
so after the first thing we were looking at was systems function -- it &apos;s because we know what these things do .
and then we went to tioring and data structures and tried to bring this to the real world -- with potential goals in the real world .
so we needed theories about these goals that we could capture or fix .
so , in order to make these theories , we call ourselves that it &apos;s definitely about high-standing sabotage , it has to be a high-quality goal , and it &apos;s very likely to be in iran , because most of the infections were made up there .
well , in this area , there are not several thousand goals .
basically , it &apos;s going to the bucheck of nuclear power power , and on the urches in natasha .
so i said to my assistant , &quot; take me a list of all experts and power from our client tribe . &quot;
and i called them up , and pump their knowledge to compare their knowledge with what we found in the code and the data .
and that worked very well .
so , it was possible for us to bring the little digital warhead with the rotorcontrol in connection .
the rotor is that moving part of the centrifuge , that black object that you see .
and when you manipulate the speed of this rogue , you &apos;re actually able to crack the rotor and eventually even explode the centrifuge .
what we &apos;ve discovered is that the goal of the attack was actually , it &apos;s slowly and to make it happen -- obviously in the trying to make engineers tempy , so that they wouldn &apos;t be able to get out of it quickly .
the great digital warhead -- we got a glimpse of how we looked at very precisely data and data structures .
so for example , the number 164 stibs out of this code , you can &apos;t miss it .
i began to work through scientific literature , about how these centriges are built in natasha and found that they were in what &apos;s called the caskaden , and every caskade has 164 centriges .
so that made sense , it fit together .
and it &apos;s got better .
these centriges in iran are divided in 15 layers .
and guess what we found in the attack ?
it &apos;s almost identical structure .
so again , that fit really well .
and this gave us great confidence for that that we studied here .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , not just that .
these results have been achieved by several weeks .
and we &apos;re just running into a dead dead and we had to rebuild ourselves .
anyway , we found that both digital warheads are actually in one and the same goal , but from different directions .
the little warhead takes over a caskade , and overs the rotors and slowed down , and the big warhead comes up with six kaskads in interaction and manipulated .
so , in the big and all of us , we are very hopeful that we actually have what the goal is .
it &apos;s nato and it &apos;s just natasha .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that other goals could be hit by stuxnet .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we &apos;ve discovered -- really made me look at the sows .
there &apos;s the gray box down there , and you see the centrility .
now , what this thing is doing is that it &apos;s starting to increase the values of sensors -- so , for example , printing sensors and vibration sensors -- and it turns out that there are legitimate code that &apos;s going on during the attack with false data .
and in fact , this false set of data is cut before .
so it &apos;s just like in hollywood movies , where the chase hunt is fed in the service of surveillance of surveillance of buildings .
that &apos;s cool , isn &apos;t it ?
the idea of this is obviously not just the machine interface in the control room .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and more aggressive .
the idea is to overlist a digital security system .
we need digital security systems where a human machine can &apos;t respond fast enough .
so , for example , in a power station , if the large superturturturbine becomes too fast , you have to open up the valves within milliseconds .
of course , this cannot be done by a human agent .
so this is where we need digital security systems .
and if they &apos;re at risk , then really bad things can happen .
the power plant can explode .
and neither the machine leaders , nor the security system , will notice it .
that &apos;s scary .
but it gets worse .
and what i &apos;m saying now is very important .
think about it . this is generic .
he has nothing to do with primitive , with uranity .
so , for example , it would work as well -- in a power station or in a car factory .
it &apos;s generic .
and you don &apos;t have to -- as the analfer -- you don &apos;t have to put the data on a usb- stick , as we saw at stuxnet .
you could also use ordinary worm technology to spread .
you just have to spread it as far as possible .
and if you do that , eventually you get a cyberweapon weapon .
that &apos;s the consequence we have to ask .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of goals is not in the middle east .
they &apos;re in the united states , in europe and japan .
so all these green areas , these are the primary environments .
we need to put the consequences , and we start getting better ready .
thank you .
i have a question .
ralph , it was reported very much that people assume that the mossad organization is the main organization behind it .
is that your opinion ?
okay , you really want to know that ?
yeah . okay .
my opinion is the mosnian involved , but the driving force is not israel .
so the driving force behind it is the cyberpower .
there &apos;s only one and this is the united states -- luckily , for happiness .
because otherwise our problem would be even greater .
thank you so much for letting us fear . thank you ralph .
i spent the last couple of years in places that are usually very difficult and somehow dangerous .
i went to jail -- hard .
i worked in a cocowork -- dangerous .
i filmed in war areas -- hard and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days doing nothing like this to eat this -- fun at the beginning , a little difficult in the middle , very dangerous at the end .
in fact , i exposed the biggest part of my career to terrible situations , and it &apos;s all for trying to study social belang that they &apos;re compelling and interesting , and hopefully in some ways , what makes them fun for the audience and accessible .
so when i knew that i would come here to look at the world of branding and sponges , i knew i &apos;d do something slightly different .
some of you may have heard that i turned a few weeks ago on ebay .
i sent some facebook messages , some twitter news , and i gave people the opportunity to stand on my tedtalk in 2011 .
really , some happy people and companies , hygiene and non-profits , got the unique opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure that chris anderson will never let me go back to buy this a title that didn &apos;t really have a title and not many clues of what the subject would be .
so what you got was this : your name here was : my tedtalk , from which you don &apos;t know what the subject is going to be , and the one you could get to the content to fly the ears , especially if i could stand your company for your participation .
but more than that , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
you know how many people look at these tedtalks ?
a whole lot .
that &apos;s only the unemployed .
so despite that warning , i knew anybody would buy the name right .
now , if you had asked me this one year ago , i wouldn &apos;t have been able to tell you this .
but in the new project i work on , my new film , we study the world of marketing , the advertising .
as i said , i went into some pretty horrible situations , but nothing was able to prepare me , nothing to be able to do with anything so hard and so dangerous about these guys in a room .
you know , i had the idea for a movie .
what i would like to do is a film about a product of therapeutic , marketing and advertising , where all the film is funded by product , marketing and advertising .
and the film is going to be called &quot; the goldilocks . &quot;
so what happens in &quot; the goldilocks theft ever , &quot; is that everything from up to the bottom , from the beginning to the end , is completely covered with brands -- from the cover , which you &apos;ll see in the movie , that &apos;s the brand xth .
now this brand , the quality of comcomm stadium , the static center ...
these people will be connected to the film in ee- -- forever .
and so the film will look at this whole idea -- that &apos;s what ? in e80s , forever ?
i &apos;m a redundant person .
that was more to the concrete .
it was &quot; in e80s forever . &quot;
but we &apos;re not only going to have the brand x as a cover sponsor , but we will ensure that we &apos;re going to sell every possible category in the movie .
this is how we might sell a shoe and it &apos;s going to sell the greatest shoe you ever wore ...
the greatest car that you &apos;ve ever left out of , &quot; the rabbit &apos;s ever time , &quot; the greatest drink you &apos;ve ever had , a attention of &quot; the rabbit &apos;s ever ever . &quot;
so the idea is , besides showing that brands are part of the life , they actually get to fund the film ?
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
the goal of the film is transparency .
you &apos;ll see the whole thing in the movie .
so this is the whole concept , the whole film , from beginning to end .
and i would be happy if ceg was going to help this .
you know , it &apos;s funny , because when i first heard it , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience .
i don &apos;t know what people are going to be like .
do you have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use &quot; perspective &quot; because that &apos;s a negative connotation -- but you know how to develop it ?
how much money is required to realize that ?
1.5 million .
i think it &apos;s hard to meet , but i think it &apos;s worth to address some really , really familiar brands .
who knows when the movie comes out , we might look like a horlidite .
what do you think the answer will be ?
the answer will be highly likely .
but is it a difficult thing for the movie or a difficult thing for me ?
jk : both .
so ... so , not so optimistic .
so , my lord , you can help me ? i need help .
i can help .
okay .
fantastic .
we need to think about what brands are .
yeah .
if you look at the people you have to do it ...
there are some places that we can turn to .
imagine the camera .
i thought , &quot; imagine the camera from &quot; would mean that we wanted to lead a back conversation . &quot;
it turns out it meant , &quot; we want to do nothing with your film . &quot;
and just so all these companies disappeared , one after the other .
no one wanted to do something with the movie .
i was amazed .
they wanted nothing to do with the project .
and i was confused , because i thought the whole concept of advertising was to present your product so many people like possible , so many people can let it be possible .
especially in the world today , at this intersection of new media and old media , and the media landscape -- it &apos;s not the idea of being in this new exciting tool , that the mass is bringing the message .
no , that was what i thought .
but look , the problem was that my idea had a fatal mistake , and that was that .
actually , it wasn &apos;t the mistake at all .
that would have been no problem at all .
that would have been okay .
but that , what this picture is , is a problem .
see , if you &apos;re taking transparency at google search , this is one of the first images that seems .
i really like your way , sergey brin . now .
this was the problem : transparency -- free of deception and pedestriy , just to discover and look through it ; it immediately detects character , character of vision and access to information , especially what business language is -- the last line is certainly the biggest problem .
you know , we hear a whole bunch of about transparency .
our politicians say it , our president says , even our ceos say it .
but when it comes to that , it should be implemented , something .
but why ? well , transparency is scary -- like this strange bear that remains still .
it &apos;s unpredictable -- like this strange land street .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
what else is more risky ?
a whole bowl of cool controls eat .
this is very risky .
so when i started talking with the companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
you see , when i was a kid , and my father stood me on lying -- and there he sits and looked at me with this view -- he would say , &quot; my son , there &apos;s three versions in every story .
there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the real version . &quot;
so you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the real version .
but there &apos;s only a company that was willing to help us -- and it &apos;s just because i &apos;ve known john bond and richard church &apos;s tree for years -- i found that i had to go around , i had to go around the middle of my team and go to the companies .
so what you suddenly started to understand -- or what i started to understand -- was that if you start talking with these companies , the idea of how your brand is going to be understood , a broader problem .
i &apos;ve got friends who make big , huge hollywood movies , and i have friends that make little rabbits like me .
and my friends , the great , giant hollywood movies , say that the reason their films are so successful , the brand partners , the brand partners they have .
and then my friends , who make small rabbits , &quot; well , how do we compete with these big , gigantic hollywood movies ? &quot;
and the film is called &quot; the goldilocks . &quot;
so how exactly are we going to see clay in the movie ?
whenever i do the way , and whenever i open the medical closet , you &apos;ll see clay deodorant .
and every time i interview somebody , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ?
are you as far ? you see a little bit nervous .
i want to help you to calm out .
so maybe you should have a little bit of interview before interview . &quot;
and then we offer one of these great apples .
either &quot; flms. fusion &quot; or &quot; paradise &quot; , you &apos;ll have the choice .
we &apos;re being equipped both for men and for women -- noted , t-based , or a stick , whatever .
that &apos;s the short term .
now , i can answer all of your questions and give you an escape of sound .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
as you &apos;ve talked about the smaller movies , we &apos;re as a brand .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other brands .
so doing these things -- you know , remind people of ban -- that &apos;s sort of why we are interested .
what words would you like to describe ?
ban is migraine .
this is a great question .
woman : overdog technology .
technology is not the way you should describe something that someone does among the eighth curves .
we talk about bold , fresh .
i think , &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word that this category is really doing something positive , unlike &quot; fighting smell and humidity . &quot;
it keeps you fresh .
how can we keep it fresh -- better fresh , more fresh , three fresh .
these things have a more positive effect .
and this is a million-million-company .
what about me ? what about the prints ?
i have to talk to the man on the street that are like me , the otto-normal consumer .
you should tell me something about my brand .
how would you describe your brand ?
hmmm , my brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i really like like beautiful clothes .
&apos; 80s revival hits skate , except the sink .
all right , what is the brand ?
unique .
i think the genre , the style i have , is probably &quot; dark glamour . &quot;
i like a lot of black colors , lots of gray notes and stuff .
but usually i have a accessory , like sunglasses , or a jewelry and stuff like that .
if dan was a brand , he would probably be a classic merceder floating .
the brand i &apos;m , i would say , is compassionate fly .
in fact , part hippie , part of yogi , part of brooklyn girls -- i don &apos;t know .
man 3 : i &apos;m the smuseum guy .
i sell up all over the country , in the world .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
this is my brand in my little , distorted industry .
man 4 : my brand is fedex , because i was more mature .
my husband five : brand lost alcohol addict .
is that going ?
lawyer : i &apos;m a brand .
i &apos;m tom .
well , we can &apos;t all be the tom-brand , but i often look at the interface of the dark glamour and candy fly .
and what is noticed was that i needed a experts .
i needed somebody who could get into my head , someone who could really help me understand what &apos;s called &quot; branded personality . &quot;
and so i found a company called olson zani in pittsburgh .
they have companies like nevey , febreze , hallmark helped to discover these brand personality .
if they could do it , they could help me .
they brought their pictures , yes ?
i did . the first picture is a picture of my family .
tell me a little bit about how to connect with your thoughts and feelings about yourself .
these are the people who form my world view .
tell me about this world .
md : this world ? i think the world is the world in which you live -- like humans around you , the friends , the family , the way you live , the work , the way you live and so .
all of these things come and start from a place , and for me , and they start with my family in west virginia .
what is the next thing you want to talk about .
the next one . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
what does that mean to the mind and feelings about themselves ?
it &apos;s like i &apos;d like to be .
i like things that are different .
i like things that are special . i like random things .
tell me about the &quot; why &quot; -- what does it bring us ?
what is the machete ? what dolls are they currently ?
why is it important to start ? what represents the red ?
tell me a little bit about that part .
a little bit more about them , they &apos;re not .
what other metals have they gone through ?
that doesn &apos;t have to be a fear . what kind of rolleraster are you ?
nonsense ! no , thank you .
thank you very much for your patience .
yeah . all right .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what it &apos;s going to be .
there went quite a lot of crazy things .
the first thing i saw was that this idea that your brand personality is two separate , but it has a supplements -- the morgan llod brand is an eight-fold / cause .
it &apos;s very good .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction with it .
and i think some companies will just focus on a strength instead of both .
many companies tend to do that -- and that &apos;s the human nature -- to avoid things that they &apos;re not sure they are , they become afraid , these elements , and that they welcome them to actually be a bit positive , and it &apos;s actually a skill chess .
what other brands are doing ?
the first one is a classic , apple .
and you can see it here , a target , wii , mini of mini coopers and visual blue .
now , there was brands , and there &apos;s an eight-word brands , these things that come and go , but it &apos;s an eight-word , more mind-brand thing .
an eight-fold , played brand . how is your brand ?
if someone asked them to describe their brand identity , their brand personality , how would they be ?
you &apos;re going to move it up ? are you something that takes your blood into wallets ?
or are they more likely ?
are you something that a little bit quiet , a tower , conservative ?
up and up , things are things that are played , like the fresh prince , time-time , adventurally , and love , and love as a flynn flynn , etc , and myl and mystic and mystical , like gandalf .
or are you more like a lowering ?
are you eight minutes and moons like el7 ?
are you starting , traditionally , heal-, compassionate , like oprah ?
are they reliable , stable , family , safe , born , healed , perverse and way like the dalai lama ?
in the course of the film , we had more than 500 companies , up and down companies , and the &quot; no &quot; because they didn &apos;t want to be part of the project .
they didn &apos;t want to do anything with this film , because they had no control , no control over the finished product .
but it turns out 17 brand partners who were willing to get out of these control , who wanted to do business with someone who wanted to do so eight-hour and play like me , and tell us to tell stories that we don &apos;t really have had to support -- stories that normally would never support .
they were able to tell us the story of the neuromarketing , as we tell the story in this film , that you now use mri to try and make the fun centers of the brain , both about advertising and film .
we went to sao paulo where sead was banned .
in the entire city , for five years , there &apos;s no suggestion , no poster , no mustard , nothing .
and we went to school districts , where companies are moving away from their own schools , in america .
the incredible thing for me is that the projects i got most of the feedback , or where i had the biggest success , those are where i interact with things directly .
and that &apos;s what these tags have done .
because they went around the mediterranean , they went around , and they said that the agencies may not really have their interest in purpose .
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artist directly .
i &apos;m going to work with him and create something completely different , something that people think is going to be challenging for our world .
and what was it like for them ? what it was ?
well , there &apos;s a film called the sundance film festival , we can look at it .
according to burra , the first was in january , and since then -- and that &apos;s not even the whole thing -- there were 900 million calls of this film .
this actually includes a period of two / 2 weeks .
this is just online -- no press , no television .
the film was not balanced yet .
you don &apos;t even have it online . no offending .
he &apos;s not come out in other countries .
well , finally , the film has a very big momentum .
and that &apos;s not bad for a project where almost every commercial agency , which we were talking about , has recommended their customers to leave the fingers of it .
something that i firmly believe is that when you get your chance , you get risks , you get risks in those risks .
i think if you hold people out of it , you get them closer to failure .
i think that , if you &apos;re trained your employees to avoid risks , you &apos;re prepared for the whole company to get a profit .
i feel that we need to encourage people to take risks .
we need to encourage people to have no fear in front of the possibilities that you might be afraid .
after all , we should embrace fear .
we should put the bear in the cage .
welcome to fear . welcome to the risk .
one big lion , so we welcome the risk .
and finally , we should welcome transparency .
today , more than ever before , it brings us a little bit of honesty .
and that said , with honesty and transparency , my full talk , &quot; welcome to transparency , &quot; it was presented by my good friends of emc , the $ 7100 for the name of ebay .
big data is transformed for organizations around the world in big opportunities .
the emc is called &quot; transparency &quot; .
thank you very much .
now , morgan , in the name of transparency , what happened to the $ 7100 ?
this is a great question .
i have a check in my pocket , on the top of the ted organization , the sapler foundation -- a check in height of $ 100 , to fund my ted performance in the next year .
my name is amit .
18 months ago , i did something else at google , and i went to do something with museums and art , and my chetter , who is now , gave me green light .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of fun negotiations and stories that i can tell you , with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the demo .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we &apos;ve done this .
i think my personal view is very simple with this slide and to explain your access .
i grew up in india .
i became a great training of education -- i &apos;m not suggesting -- but i had no access to many museums and this art work .
and when i went to visit and visit these museums , i started learning a lot .
and while i was working for google , i tried to do this desire -- making art accessible to technology .
we then put a team , a great team , and we started with this .
i &apos;m going to start with the demonstration , and tell you some interesting things that happened since the start .
so you &apos;re just going to imtool project.com.
you can look around in all these museums .
this is the uffizi , the moma , the hereck , the van gogh , van gogh .
i even come in one of my favorite , the metropolitan museum of art in new york .
you get in two ways -- very simple .
click , and wumms , you &apos;re in this museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where they are -- bombay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t make any difference .
you &apos;re going around and tribal .
you want to innovate in the museum ?
open the map , and jump with a click .
in there they are , they want to end up to the end of the gang .
just further . much fun .
welcome them .
thank you , but the best one .
so i &apos;m in front of one of my favorite pictures , serious breugel workers in the met .
i see this plusmark .
if the museum gave us the picture , they click on it .
now this is one of the images .
this is all the metadata .
those of you who are really interested in art can click here -- but i click it away now .
this is one of the images that we were shouting with called the &quot; gigapith technology . &quot;
for example , this picture has about 10 billion points , i think .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you get for 10 billion points ? &quot;
i &apos;m going to show you now .
you can zoom in very easily and zoom in .
you see something funny here .
i love this guy ; his expression is unaffordable .
but then you really want to get deep in .
and so i started playing around , and i realized that there was something happening there .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
i went close , and i slowly noticed that these kids would actually put something .
i was a little bit , i talked to a little bit about the met , and actually found it turned out to be a game called curail , where a goose was beaten up at a stick .
it seemed pretty popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
to get really close , you can go up to the horror .
just to give you a glimpse of that , i &apos;ll go out and see what you get .
here we were , and this is the painting .
the best thing is , but in a second .
let &apos;s jump quickly to moma , again in new york .
another favorite picture of me , star night .
for example , it was about finding details .
but what if you want to see the pinks ?
and what if you want to see van gogh made this master &apos;s work ?
you zoom in . you can really go in .
i &apos;m going to zoom in with one of my favorite lines of this picture , until i really am in the blink .
this is star night , probably never seen before .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
there are many more , but i don &apos;t have time .
this is really cool , it &apos;s called collections .
every one of you , everybody -- whether rich or poor , if you have a great house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
you can go ahead and create your own museum online -- from all these images you can put up your own collection .
simple , they go in -- and i &apos;ve created this , it &apos;s called the &quot; the power of the -- you can zoom around . &quot;
this is it , in the national realm .
you can put it all together , send your friends , send a conversation about what you feel when you look at these masterpieces .
i think finally , for me , the main thing is that all the wonderful things here don &apos;t come from google .
they don &apos;t even come from the museums .
i should not say that .
they come from the artists .
and that was an experience in humility for me .
i mean , i hope we &apos;re just going to do this with this digital medium of art , and they represent it online online .
and the biggest question i asked you about is , &quot; did you do this to replicate the experience of a museum lamg ? &quot;
the answer is no .
it &apos;s supposed to be the experience .
that &apos;s why . thank you .
thank you .
this is a picture of your brain . your brain can be split in two halves .
this is the left half , which is the logical side , and then the right half , which is the intuitive side .
if we had a scale to measure the apbies every hemisphere , we could have their brain .
for example , this would be somebody who is completely logical .
this would be somebody who &apos;s completely intuitive .
now , where would you scale your brain on this scale ?
some of us may have decided for one of these extreme , but i think , for most people in the audience , your brain looks like this -- with a high apque , which is at the same time .
it &apos;s not like they &apos;re both exclusive or something like that .
you can be logical and intuitive .
and so i see myself as one of the people in common with most other experimental quantum physictions that need a good percentage of logic to add the complex ideas together .
but at the same time , we need a good proportion of intuition to actually do experiments .
how do we develop this intuition ? well , we love playing things .
so we go out and play with it and then look how it react , and then we start to develop our intuition .
basically , they do the same thing .
so one of the intuitive positions you &apos;ve developed over the years is probably that one thing can be at the same time .
i mean , it can sound strange to think that a thing is at the same time in two different places , but they were not born with this idea , they &apos;ve developed it .
i remember seeing a child playing on a bottom threshold .
he was a little kid and not very good at it , and he fell all the time .
but i bet it &apos;s a very valuable thing to do with the bottom threshold , which is that the big things don &apos;t just leave you , and that they stay in a place .
and this is a great conceptual model of the world , so long you &apos;re not a particle physicist .
it would be a terrible model for a particle physicist , because they don &apos;t play with soil , but with these little weird particles .
and if you play with your particles , imagine all kinds of weird things -- like you &apos;re flying directly through walls , or you can be at the same time at two different places .
and so they wrote all these observations , and they called the theory of quantum mechanics .
that was the state of physics a few years ago ; you needed quantum mechanics to describe the little tiny particles .
but you didn &apos;t need them to describe the great mundane objects around us .
it didn &apos;t enjoy my intuition , and maybe because i &apos;m not so often playing with particles .
well , i &apos;ll play with you sometimes , but not very often .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
i mean , nobody ever saw a particle .
but my logical side didn &apos;t enjoy it .
because if all of these things are made of particles and all these particles follow the rules of quantum mechanics , then shouldn &apos;t just follow all the rules of quantum mechanics ?
i don &apos;t see why that should not be .
so i would feel better with the whole thing , if we could sort of show that everyday objects could follow the rules of quantum mechanics .
so i made a few years ago , just to do that .
i created one .
this is the first object you can see in the quantum mechanical superposition .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and you can see this green dot there in the middle .
that &apos;s the piece of metal i &apos;m going to talk about .
this is a picture of the object .
here i am a little bit bigger . we look at the center here .
and here &apos;s a really big close-up of this little piece of metal .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little bit of metal as a spring board and it stands over the edge .
so i made this thing on the way that you make a computer chip .
i went to a clean space with new silicon slices , and racked for 100 hours of all the big equipment .
for the last bit , i had to build my own machine -- to build this like a swimming pool , and the thing to get .
this thing has the ability in the quantum mechanical superposition , but it needs a little help to do it .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you know how uncomfortable it is to be in a full elevator ?
i mean , if i &apos;m alone in the elevator , i do all kinds of weird things , but then other people go up and i &apos;ll stop doing all these things , because i don &apos;t want to bother it , or , frankly , you get off .
so quantum mechanics says that unmoving objects are just the same .
they &apos;re not just people who are not just people , but the light that seems to be on them and the wind , the ones that are over to them and the heat of the space .
and so we knew that if we wanted to see this piece of metal mechanically mechanical , we had to take the whole out of it .
and we did that .
we turned out the light , put it into a vacuum , and we put the entire air out of it , and kissed it up to almost now , alone in the elevator , to behave like it wanted to .
so we measured his movement .
we found that it &apos;s moving really strange .
instead of just being quiet there , it vibrates . the way it was vibrating was about this kind of -- like this -- like a spread and together and together , and together .
in that we gave him a little push , we could collect it at the same time , and not vibrating -- something that allowed only in quantum mechanics .
so what i &apos;m just telling you is what truly fantastic .
what does it mean to vibrate at the same time and not vibrating ?
let &apos;s think about atoms .
so the first case : all the trillions of atoms that are made of metal is silent , and at the same time , the same atoms are moving and down .
just too precise , they agree .
the rest of the time are rotating .
that means that every atom is at the same time in two different places , which is that the entire piece of metal is in two different places .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
really .
this was worth me to close up for all this year in the clean room , because , you know , the scale difference between a single atom and this piece of metal is about the same as the piece of metal and you .
so if a single atom can be at the same time in two different places , that piece of metal can be two different places , why not you ?
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logical side says .
so , imagine you &apos;d be at the same time in multiple places , how would that feel ?
how would your consciousness deal with it that your body is rooted in the space ?
there &apos;s another aspect of the story .
when we turned it down , the light turned out , and the box looked inside , we saw that the piece of metal used to be in a piece .
and so i had to develop this new intuition that it looks like all the objects in the elevator are really just set of objects that are extended in a small space .
you hear a lot about how quantum mechanics says that everything is connected to everything .
well , that &apos;s not quite true .
there &apos;s more behind that , it &apos;s even deeper .
it &apos;s that these connections , their connections with all the things around them , literally define who they are , and that &apos;s the deep and strange of quantum mechanics .
thank you .
in 2007 , i decided we should be able to think of request as we think about economic development .
it should be our goal that if families think about where they live and work , they gave them the opportunity to choose between at least one hand full of different cities that are all in competition .
now we are far away from this goal .
there are billions of people in the developing world who don &apos;t even have a single city for them to welcome .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they &apos;re worth so much more than it costs to build .
so we could make the world very simple with duzend , maybe even hundreds of new cities .
now this may sound absurd for you , unless you &apos;ve never thought about new cities .
they just share the building of apartments from cities .
imagine half the people who want to live in homes , did this already ; the other half didn &apos;t .
you could try to expand the capacity of existing apartments already .
but you know what you were going to be doing , in these apartments , and the environment around you , the laws of the law , and you get out of it .
so it turns out to be very hard to get rid of all this distributed .
but you could go to a completely new place , build a new housing block , put the laws there , and don &apos;t stop it .
so i &apos;ve suggested that governments create new surfaces that provide enough space for a city and gave them a name : charter cities .
later , i discovered that about the same time , ja4 and octavio was thinking about the challenge of a reform in honduras .
they knew that every year about 75,000 pounds of her country leaving their country to go to the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to make sure that these people can stay in their country and do exactly the same thing in honduras .
at this point , ja4 , to octavio , said , &quot; what happens when we take an undefeated surface of our country -- what if we just put them on a message of american embassy -- a part of the eastern embassy , and if people want to go to the eastern world , they can do everything in the eastern world , whatever they need to go to canada or america ? &quot;
in the summer in 2009 , honduras was in favor of a relieved chain .
over the next plangy elections , pepe lobo won in a change , whose program promised both innovations as well .
he asked octavio to become his stable .
in the meantime , i prepared a talk at tedglobal .
through improvement , and through the study of consumers , i &apos;ve tried to reduce this complicated concept of the charter city on the ground .
the first point , the importance of laws , is the importance of laws , laws that determine that you can &apos;t break existing owners .
we &apos;re spending new resources , but for the progress required , it &apos;s technologies and laws , and it &apos;s usually laws that keep us back .
in the fall of 2010 , a friend of guatemala sent out to the link to the tedtalk .
again , he showed him .
the two called me .
and said , &quot; let &apos;s present that to the head of our country . &quot;
so we met in december the hall in december of a hotels in miami .
i &apos;ve tried to make sure how valuable cities are to be much more valuable than they are .
and i used this chart to show how valuable rohland is in a place like new york . think that a space in some cases is worth thousands of dollars per square meter .
but it was a pretty abstract discussion , at a point when there was a break , i said , &quot; paul , could we look at the tedtalk . &quot;
so , the tedtalk asked in very simple shape that a charter city is a place whose beginning is uninhabited , a green contract , which represents the laws of the law and the people who have the opportunity to choose either , or not .
that &apos;s why i was asked by the president of honduras , who meant that we have to make this project happen , that it &apos;s important , and that this is the way we get our country forward .
i was asked to come to tegucipa , and again , to keep a talk in the fourth and fifth january .
so i &apos;ve been given another thing with facts that have a graph like this , which has tried to suggest that if you want to make a lot of value in a city , it must be a very large city .
this is a picture of the city , and the sketch represents the new airport that was built in denver .
this airport alone has a 100 square kilometers .
so i tried to convince hondurans , if you want to build a new city , you have to start with at least 1,000 square miles .
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand tomorrow .
polite , all applauping .
the audience of the audience were very serious and careful .
the leader of congress came to the stage and said , &quot; professor romer , i thank you very much for your talk , but maybe we might look at the tedtalk .
i have him on my laptop here . &quot;
so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk .
and i came to the point that a new city offers new possibilities to people .
there would be a way to live in a city that would be in honduras , rather than hundreds of miles away in the north .
and a new city includes new ways for executives with one .
leaders of the government in honduras would depend on the aid of suicide countries , they could benefit from their partner countries that they &apos;d put in the laws of the law for this charter and to be able to trust that the charter is really going through .
and the realization of president lobo , was that the certainty of the agreement i &apos;ve been thinking about as a way of getting the foreign investors to come and be able to build this city as well for all parties in honduras , which has been suffering for many years and mistrust .
we are in a field .
this picture is from this place .
it sums up thousands of acres .
and shortly after that , at the 19th of january , they &apos;ve been voted on congress for a change in the constitution to have a disclaimation that is available for special development areas .
in a country that has just a strong crisis behind it , congress has been elected to a voice with 124 to a voice .
all parties , all the questions of society , supported this .
to become part of the constitution , it has to be twice through congress .
at the 17th of february , it was approved to a voice for the second time .
immediately after that election , between the 21st and the 24th of february , a delegation of about 30 employees went to the two places in the world that were most interested in the business of the city .
one place is southern korea .
this is a picture of a big , new city , which is built in southern korea , large than the city .
everything you can see on this picture was built within four years after it took four years to get the approval .
the other place that was interested in the city is singapore .
there were two cities built in china , and the third is in preparation .
so if you think about it , it &apos;s where we are today .
you already have a building site ; you &apos;re looking at this area for the second city .
it &apos;s already been working on a legal system that encouragement allows us to participate , and it &apos;s also working on an external legal system .
a country has already offered its top court to provide it as a court for the unknowable appeal of the court .
also urban designers and farmer are very interested .
they even bring funding with one .
one thing , as you already know , has been done , there &apos;s a lot of miche .
there are many companies that would like to be in america , especially in a place of free-trade zone , and there are many people who would like to live there .
there are 700 million people around the world who are saying that they want to live permanent on another place .
a million people a year of latin america and travels into the united states .
many of them are fathers who are forced to let their families go back to suak , sometimes they &apos;re single mothers who have to make enough money to eat food and clothing .
unfortunately , it &apos;s sometimes children who are trying to find their parents that they , in some cases , haven &apos;t seen them since a decade .
so what is it for an idea to think about in honduras &apos;s one new city ?
or even duzend of these cities , or are they spread across the world ?
so what &apos;s it for , to have an idea that every family has a choice between several cities that are in competition for new residents ?
this is an idea worth spreading .
my friends from honduras asked me to say , thank you ted .
you know how many decisions you make on a typical day ?
you know , how many decisions do you meet in a typical week ?
i recently did a poll with over 2,000 americans , and the average number of decisions that make a typical american on a day is 70.
it was also done recently a study with ceo in which she saw the ceo for a week .
and these scientists have simply documented the different themes with which these ceos are working , and how much time they spent making decisions with the issues together .
and they found that an average ceo is working with 139 jobs a week .
each of these themes had , of course , from many , many smaller decisions .
50 percent of their decisions were made within nine minutes or less .
just for about 12 percent of their decisions needed an hour or more of their time .
think about your own decisions .
do you know how many decisions you meet in the nine minutes of category in one hour ?
how good do you think are the decisions in dealing with it ?
today i want to talk about one of the biggest decision-making problems of our modern time , the decision-making problem .
i want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions .
now , if i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions and i want to know your answers .
if i ask you a question , raise them , because i &apos;m blind , only if you want to burn some calories .
otherwise , i ask you , if i ask you a question , and your answer is yes , so my first question for today is : are you ready to hear something about decision-making ?
thank you .
when i was a graduate student at stanford university , i went to this very very exclusive store , at least at the time , he was really exclusive .
it was a store that was called draeger .
this business , it was almost like a pleasure savings .
they had 250 different kinds of mustard and oil and over 500 different kinds of fruit and vegetables and more than two dozen different kinds of water -- and that was a time when we were actually drinking water .
i loved going to this business , but at a time , i asked myself , well , how does it never come to buy something ?
here &apos;s the olive oil gang .
they had about 75 different kinds of olive oil , including those who were in boxes of a thousand years of ancient olive trees .
so i decided to visit the branches of all the time , and i asked the head , &quot; does this model work that you really offer people all these possibilities ? &quot;
and he showed up on the bus charges of tourists who came every day and typically had their cameras .
we decided to have an experiment , and we chose marmelade for our experiment .
here &apos;s her mardge shop .
they had 348 different kinds of marmelena .
we set up a little distial shell directly at the entrance of business .
we put six different flavors there , or 24 different tastes of marmelade , and we &apos;ve looked at two things : first , what would be more people and try to get marmelade ?
there are more people left when it was 24 percent , about 60 percent when it was six , about 40 percent .
and then we looked at what the people would rather buy a glass of marmelade .
now we saw the reverse effect .
from the people who stayed as it were 24 , only three percent actually bought a glass of marmelade .
from the people who stayed as it were six , now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a glass of mars .
now , if you calculate it , people bought six times more a glass of marmelade , who they had six to the degree when they had 24 to the choices .
well , to decide not to buy a glass of marmelade is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our wadal -- but it turns out that the decision-making problem is affecting us also in very conjunction decisions .
we don &apos;t decide to decide , even though it goes against our own best interests .
so the theme of the day : financial savings .
now , i &apos;m going to describe a study that i &apos;m dealing with with gur huberman , ei jang , in which we have done the decisions to savings plans for retirement from almost a million americans from about 650 plans in the entire united states .
and what we were looking at was whether the number of fonsts were able to be able to have a pension plan that could affect 401 plan that affects the probability of whether more for tomorrow is saved .
and we found that there was actually a context .
so in these plans , we had about 657 plans that offered people anything between two to 59 different funds .
and what we found was that the more fund were offered , in fact , that the participation rate was lower .
now , if you look at the extreme , the plans , the two funds , had a split in the seventh -- still not as high as we want .
in the plans , which offered nearly 60 fund , the subbreaks were now on about six percent .
now it turns out that even if you were to look at it , when more options were available , even then it has negative consequences .
so the people who decided to participate , they decided that the more possibilities they have were available to them , the more avoiding it , and to choose the funds .
the more opportunities they have were available to them , the more they put their own money in plain cash .
none of these extreme decisions , to the decisions that someone would recommend if they care about the future financial well-being .
now , in the last 10 years , we &apos;ve seen three key economic consequences in people who provide more and more choices .
they push the decision -- push them , even when it comes to their own interest .
they &apos;re more like more comfortable decisions -- worse financial and worse medical decisions .
they &apos;re more likely to make things that make them feel less content , even if they make objective better .
the main reason for this is that we may enjoy this huge shelves of mayonaise , mustard , vand and marmelade , but we can &apos;t actually see the comparison and then we can actually choose something from the fantastic supply .
so what i want to suggest today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we &apos;ve tested on different kinds of research in different ways -- that they can just apply in their business .
first , let &apos;s go .
they &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never true than today , that less is less .
people are always concerned when i say , &quot; let &apos;s say . &quot;
they &apos;re always concerned that they lose regalspace .
but in fact , we see it more and more and more that if you &apos;re willing to let yourself , and the unimportant possibilities are going to be there , there &apos;s going to be a rising increase in the sales , &amp; amp ; and there &apos;s an improvement of decision-making .
as a proctor and a gamble , the different head of my head , in 26 ways , they found a rise of sales to pay about 10 percent .
when the golden cat was selling their 10 to the worst selling column , they realized that the profits were coming up by 87 percent -- a result of them , the rise of the sales and reducing cost of cost .
you know , the average supermack today , it gives you 45,000 products .
a typical wal-mart gives you 100,000 products today .
but the nine-est supermarket , the largest supermarket in the world today , is aldi , and they give them 1,400 products -- a kind of tomato sauce in a doses .
now in the world of savings , i believe one of the best examples that has recently been on the market , how to get the choice of manstaff , was something that david laibm &apos;s very strong , it &apos;s a program that is offered at harvard .
every single harvard entrepreneur takes away now automatically in a lifetime of life .
those who are really trying to make a choice are 20 funds , not 300 or more fund .
you know how people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to answer it .
it &apos;s all important opportunities . &quot;
and the first thing i ask the employees is , &quot; tell me how different the possibilities of each other .
and if their employees can &apos;t keep them apart , they can &apos;t do their customers . &quot;
now before we started this morning , i had a conversation with gary .
and gary said that he would be willing to offer all of the people in this audience , an all-including holiday in the world .
here &apos;s a description of the road .
and i want to read you the reading .
and now i &apos;m going to give you a couple of seconds to read and ask you to clap , if you &apos;re willing to take a shower .
okay . everyone &apos;s ready to assume gary &apos; s .
is that all ?
well , let me show you something more of it .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
now , who &apos;s ready for this journey .
i think i &apos;ve probably heard more hands .
good .
in fact , the first time you &apos;ve had more information , the first time you had more information than the second time , but i would think it &apos;s a car for the second time .
because the images made it sense for them .
which brings me to the second technology that helps you deal with the problem of decision-making , it &apos;s the physical measurement .
it &apos;s about the fact that people , to understand the difference between possibilities , have to understand what the consequences are associated with the individual possibilities , and that would have to be true and more specific .
why do people spend on average 15 to 30 percent more , if they use a click card or a credit card when they get money ?
because it doesn &apos;t feel really money .
and it turns out that if you make it that something feels concrete , it &apos;s a very good tool to save people more .
so in a study that i did with shlomo benari and alessandro , we &apos;ve made a study with the people at tears -- employees , who worked for cash -- and these people were all in a meeting in which they were working for their pension plan .
and during this meeting , we have this meeting exactly as they used to be , we added a little bit .
the small thing we added was that we asked people to just think of all the positive things that would happen in their lives when they were saving money .
in which we did this simple thing , there was an increase in participation about 20 percent and there was a rise of the number of people who were willing to save or have a rise to four percent of the time they were willing to pay for the savings account .
third technology : categorzation .
we can deal with more categories than with more choices .
here &apos;s for example , a study that we &apos;ve done in a timeline .
it turns out that in the way of being supermarkets and down in the northeast area , the number of things between 331 different types of magazines has gotten up to 664 magazines .
but you know what ?
if i show you 600 magazines , and you put them in 10 categories , or i &apos;ll show you 400 magazines , and these in 20 categories , you believe that i gave you more choices and a better choice than i had given you to 600 .
because the categories tell me how i can keep them apart .
here are two different types of dung .
one is called &quot; jazz &quot; and the other is called &quot; strangeness . &quot;
if you think that the left ad is stigmatized , and the ad on the right is jazz , then you clap into your hands .
okay , there &apos;s some .
if you think that the one on the left is jazz , and that &apos;s the one on the right , you &apos;re clapping .
okay , some more .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
the on the left is jazz and the right is mind-wandering , but you know what ?
this is a high unuseful rig .
the categories have to say something about the voters , not to put the choice .
and this problem you often see when you look at the long lists of all these funds .
who do you actually want to figure out ?
my fourth technology : premise for complexity .
it turns out we can actually handle more information than we think we have to simplify them .
we need to move the complexity slowly .
i &apos;ll show you an example of what i mean .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : the purchase of a car .
here &apos;s a clear car maker that gives you the opportunity to configuish your car completely .
you have to make 62 different decisions to design your car completely .
now these decisions are different in the number of choices they provide per choice .
car colors , foreign paint of the car -- i have 56 options .
motors , motors -- four options .
so what i do now is i change the order in the decisions .
half the customers will go from the many ways to get 56 cars to the low possibilities , four motors .
the other half of the customers go from the low possibilities , four motors , to the 56 car colors , many possibilities .
what do i look at ?
how interested they are .
if you use all the standard choices at the decision , it means that you &apos;re going to be challenged , the best , i &apos;ll lose it .
what they find is that the people who go from the many choices are always going to go and have the standard choice .
we &apos;re losing them .
go from the little choices to the many , then they &apos;ll stay .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
the only thing i &apos;ve done is to change the order of changing this information .
when i start with the simple , i learn how i choose .
even though that bottle shoots , i don &apos;t tell you about my preferences at the inside of the interior , and i still choose to choose it .
it gets me too excited about the big product that i put together , and so i &apos;m willing to make me motivate to be with interest .
let me summarize .
i &apos;ve told you about four techniques that overload the problem of decision-making -- -- are going to take the overfluid alternative , concrete -- make it real ; categorze -- we can get better with more categories , less options ; we can get better on complexity .
each of these techniques that i &apos;m going to describe today is to help you manage the possibilities -- good for you , you can use them for yourself , good for people who offer them service .
because i think the key to the best possible choice is that you can pick up with choice .
and the more we choose to select , the better we will be able to practice the art of choice .
thank you .
hi . i &apos;m kevin allocca , trends managers at youtube . i look at youtube videos .
that &apos;s true .
today , we want to talk about how video virals are becoming , and then , after all , that &apos;s important .
we all want to be stars -- celebrities , singer , , as i was young , seemed so incredibly difficult .
but webvideos have enabled us to become all of our creative activities in a part of the culture of our world .
every single one of you could be famous on the internet until the next saturday .
but at youtube , more than 48 hours of video are uploaded a minute .
it &apos;s just going to be a tiny percentage percent ever , and it &apos;s seen thousands and thousands of times and so on .
so how does this work ?
three things : tastemaker , sub-fear communities and the unexpected .
well , we want to .
oh my god . oh my god .
oh my god !
woah !
whohhhh , wogh !
last year , crab vasquez took this video that he filmed before his house in yosemite national park .
in 2010 , it was 23 million times seen .
this chart shows how it looked when the video was first popular for the first time .
it wasn &apos;t really a viral video .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
because you just do that if you &apos;re called yosemite mountain .
he had uploaded a lot of natural videos .
and this video was actually already sent in january .
what &apos;s happening here ?
there was jimmy kimmel .
jimmy kimmel sensed the tweet that made the video so popular .
because tastemaker like jimmy kimmel gives us new and interesting things and show them a big audience .
it &apos;s friday friday , friday . gotta get down down on friday . &apos; it &apos;s a regulated way to go to the proton . friday , friday , friday , friday .
rs is one of the most popular videos of the year .
it was seen almost 200 million times this year .
this is what the graphics looked like .
just like &quot; double rainbow &quot; seems to be out of nowhere .
what happened on this day ?
well , it was friday , it was .
if you want to know , these other peaks are also free days .
but what about this day , this particular friday ?
now , tosh.zero fored it , many blogs started writing about it .
michael j. nelson from the rockefeller science theater was a first one to make a joke about it .
it &apos;s important that a single person or a group of tastemaker took a point of view , with a big audience , and the process accelerated .
and then this community formed by people who shared these big raters , and they started talking about it and playing around with it .
now there are 10,000 parodies of &quot; friday &quot; in youtube .
already in the first seven days , there was a violin for every single day .
unlike the one-century conversation of the 20th century , the community spends our way to become part of this phenomenon -- either by spreading it or something new from it .
&quot; nyan kat&quot; is animation and music in endless loop .
that &apos;s it , very simple .
this year , almost 50 million times looked .
and if you think that &apos;s crazy , you should know that there &apos;s a three-hour version that was looked at four million times .
even cats look at this video .
cats look at cats who look at this video .
it &apos;s important to creativity that is in the internet culture of techies and geeks .
there were remixes .
somebody made an old-fashioned version of it .
and then it became international .
a whole reix community shot out of the ground that made it from a stupid joke to something that we can all participate in .
now we don &apos;t just find pleasure to something , we do with it .
who could have looked at this ?
who could predict &quot; double rainbow &quot; or rebecca black or &quot; nyan kat&quot; predict ?
what can you write your books in which something like this is ?
in a world where every minute , two days of video will be uploaded , it can only be really unique and unexpected and unexpected .
i &apos;m not going to be very interested , i was not very interested in being a friend of mine , and i was going to look at this great video , about a guy who protested in new york against traffic wheels .
i got a ticket , because i wasn &apos;t going to go away from the bike , but often there &apos;s a lot of disability that doesn &apos;t have to go on the bike .
and this was completely surprising and humorous , that casey niestr was funny , and his argument about five million times .
this approach is true for everything we do creative .
and that all leads us to a big question ...
what does that mean ?
whohhh .
what does that mean ?
tastemaker , creative associations communities , are completely unexpected , are the features of a new kind of media and culture to each access to the audience , and in the audience that is popular .
as i said , one of the largest stars -- justin beber -- made his start at youtube .
nobody needs to give your ideas green .
and today we &apos;re all feeling as owners of our popular culture .
and these aren &apos;t the characteristics of the old media and they also hardly meet the media of today , but they will determine the conversation of the future .
thank you .
how can i talk to you about the relationship between women about three generations , and how the amazing strength of this connectedness was in a four-year-old girl &apos;s life when she was over 30 years ago with her little sister , her mother and her grandmother &apos;s five days , and she never disappeared in a small boat in san francisco , and she never disappeared -- this little girl , and she has never disappeared before you .
the story is not over yet .
it &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s going to put together .
i want to tell you about some of the puzzle lebits .
imagine the first piece : a man who burns his life .
he &apos;s a poet , a writer , a man whose whole life was held by the simple hope of unity and freedom of his home .
think of it as march the most communicates in saigon , as it needs to be , that his life had been a single waste .
the words , as long as his friends , spotsaw now .
he moved back to silence .
he died , broken through the history .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i never met him personally .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
my grandmother never forgotten me his life .
i had to worry that it was not for free , and it was my job to learn that the story was absolutely trying to break us , but we were over it .
and the next piece of puzzle shows how a boat in the early morgenia is running out of lake .
my mother may be 18 when her father died -- in an arranged marriage , already with two little girls .
for them , the life had asked her a job : the escape of her family and a new life in australia .
it was completely excluded that it could fail .
after a four-year and a film shirt , a boat saga glip on the lake , as a fishing boat .
all the adults were aware of the risks .
the biggest fear they had before pirates , rape and death .
like most adults on the boat , my mother wore a little toxic bottle on it .
in captivity , my sister would have , and i , you know , drink me and my grandmother .
my first memories are from this boat -- stest-tuckers of the engine , clapping of each wave on the bug , the vast and empty horizon .
i don &apos;t remember the pirates , a lot of times , but from the death of the men on our boat , let &apos;s fake , or in the case of the engine that didn &apos;t want to launch six hours .
but i remember the lights of the oil platform from the malaysia coast , and on the young man who collapsed and died , the end of the journey was too much for him , and the taste of the first aprock gave me one of the men on the platform .
no apple ever caught this way again .
after three months in refugee camp , we landed in melbourne .
and the next piece of puzzle is about four women in three generations to build a new life together .
we let ourselves down in football , one of the working-day paths , whose population consists of imregulated layers .
in other ways , in the old-age of middle america , whose existence was completely unknown to me , there was no more sophisticated thinking .
the rustices came out of the rest of the world .
and the fat of english were broken between people who had one thing in common : they started new .
my mother worked on farms , then at a running band in a car factory , six days , double layers .
it kind of managed to find the time to have english and agency .
we were poor .
each dollar was divided , and it was put in more education for english and mathematics , no matter what we had to do for this . most of the time , the new things came out of the second .
two few strands for school , each , to cover the holes in the other .
a school uniform to the buttons , because she had to get six years .
and there was the rare but painful of &quot; eye &quot; and there and da paintings : &quot; asians , go home . &quot;
after home ?
a little counterintuitive in me .
there was a meeting , and a calm voice said , &quot; i &apos;m going to go out of the way . &quot;
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
my mother was exhausted every night , but we told each other about our day , and we heard the movement of our grandmother in the house .
my mother suffered from the boat .
and it was my job to stay awake every night , until their founding dreams came up so i could make them .
they opened up a computer business , and then a cosmologist and then opened up a business .
and the women came with their stories about men who didn &apos;t make change , angry and unflexible , and violent children , caught between two worlds .
loans and sponsors were searching .
centers were built up .
i lived in parallel worlds .
in one , i was the classic asian student , who turned out to be an unpleasant expectation .
in the other , i was in uncertain life , who wore tragic scars of violence , the drug abuse and the isolated .
but so many received over the years .
and because of this help , i was regarded in my last year of judaism as a young australiker of the year .
and i was taken by a piece of puzzle , and the edges of the fit didn &apos;t fit together .
tan le , anonymous habitler of football , was now a refugee , refugee and social activist that was invited to speak to places that they had never heard , and in homes whose existence they could never have imagined .
i was not familiar with labels .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the bribe .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i wanted to go back to the routine and the comfort of life of a unknown preference -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters , who sat like this for the last 20 years , by telling each other the stories of their day , and slept in the same bed .
i told my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
she reminded me that i was so old now as she came up with the boat .
no one has been a possibility .
&quot; just do it , &quot; she said . &quot; and not what you &apos;re not . &quot;
so i talked about jugenaues and education , and the marginalized of the marginalized and disagreed .
and the more open i was talking , the more i should tell .
i met people in all life , so many of them did what they loved in the limits of possible .
and even though i graduated , i realized i couldn &apos;t find myself with a career in jura .
there had to be another piece of puzzle .
and i realized that at the same time that it &apos;s okay to be an underdog , a new kind of a new kind of view -- and not just okay , but something you need to be grateful for , maybe a gift of the boat .
because dacational can be so easy to collapse in the horizon , so it can mean that you accept the assumptions of the environment .
i went now enough from my comfort to know that , yes , the world breaks apart , but not as you fear it .
possibilities that would have been not allowed to be hacked .
there was a energy , and there was an unpleasant optimism , a strange blhost of humility .
so i followed my gut feeling .
i collected a little team of people around me , which is not &quot; a shoppy challenge . &quot;
for a year we didn &apos;t have a cent .
so at the end of every day , i &apos;m paying a giant mountain soup that we shared .
we used to work in the night .
most of our ideas were crazy , but it was a few brilliant , and we did the breakthrough .
i met the decision to pull in the united states .
after just a journey there .
my gut feeling again .
three months later , i was moved and the adventure went on .
before i leave the talk , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up at a time in the confuciananism , the social norm , and the local 12th person was the most important person .
life had not changed since centuries .
her father died shortly after her birth .
her mother moved her alone .
with 17 , she became a second woman who she proposed her .
without a man &apos;s support of her husband , she worried for a great deal by bringing him back to trial , and he was engaged in her own case , and she was even bigger than she won .
&quot; i don &apos;t have it as an untrue .
i was just in a hotel room in sydney when she died . 1,000 miles away in melbourne .
i looked through the shock wall and saw it on the other side .
i knew she had come to say she said .
my mother called me a few minutes after that .
a few days later , we went into a buddhist temple in football and sat around her sarg .
we told her stories and insurance that we were still in her .
at midnight , the monk came and said he had to close the sarg .
my mother asked us to grab her hand .
she asked the monk , &quot; why is your hand so warm and the rest of it is so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because they &apos;ve been holding them for this morning , &quot; he said .
&quot; they didn &apos;t leave them . &quot;
if there &apos;s a band in our family , it goes through the women .
you see who we were and how life has shaped us , we can now see that the men who might have come into our lives would come to the source .
the defeat would have been too simple .
now i &apos;d like to have my own children , and i think about the boat .
who would ever wish one ?
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of privilege , before preideation .
can i give you a bug in your life that &apos;s courageous every wave of wave , which is uninhabited , steicy tuckers of the engine , which doesn &apos;t guarantee anything ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give this , and you could get through that , i would do it .
also , the mother is here today in the fourth or fifth row .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
is it photography at all ?
because , of course , this is a picture you can &apos;t pick up with your camera .
yet , my interest began in photography when i received my first digital camera at 15 years old .
i combined it with my former preference for drawing , but it was a little different , because the camera was actually in planning .
and if you pick up a picture with a camera , the process ends , if you press it .
so for me , photography seemed more like walking on the right place .
i thought anybody could do that .
so i wanted to create something else , something where the process starts when the cause is going on .
photographs like this : a building along a much broader road .
but it has an unexpected twist .
and nevertheless , a realistic level .
or photographs like this -- dark and colorful at the same time , but everybody with the common goal to keep a realistic level .
if i say reality , i mean photo-reality .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can really capture , but i always want to let it look like you could , on a picture .
photographs that you have to think about a short moment to figure out the trick .
so it &apos;s more about catching an idea than really a moment .
but what is the trick that makes it realistic ?
is it about the details or the colors ?
is it about light ?
what creates the illusion ?
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
but ultimately , it &apos;s about how we can interpret the world , and how it can be done on a two-dimensional surface .
it &apos;s not about what &apos;s realistic , but what we think is realistic .
so i think the basics are very simple .
i see them as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces and put it together to create an alternative reality .
and let me show you a simple example .
we have three perfect interpreble physical objects that we can all identify in a three-dimensional world .
but in a certain way , they can combine something that looks still three-dimensional , as if it could exist .
but at the same time , we know that it &apos;s not possible .
so we overlist our brains , because our brain really simply didn &apos;t realize it makes sense .
and i see the same process in combine photographs .
it &apos;s really about combining different realities of realities .
so the things that look a realistic picture , i think , are the things that we don &apos;t think about , the things around us in our lives .
but if we combine photographs , it &apos;s really important to think , because otherwise you just kind of look wrong .
so i would say there are three simple rules to follow , to get a realistic outcome .
as you can see , these aren &apos;t three special images .
but they can combine something special like this .
so the first rule is that combined photos should have the same perspective .
secondly , combined the same lighting kind of light .
and these two pictures are watching these two demands -- from the same altitude , and the same lighting kind of light .
third of all , it &apos;s impossible to make it different from where the individual images begin and end up using them .
does it impossible to say how the photo was actually put together .
so , by adding color , contrast and hellibility to the edges of the single images , a photographic man , as a field of digital , discharged colors and disorders , let &apos;s tear the boundaries between the different images and how a single photograph can appear , even though a picture can contain hundreds of layers .
here &apos;s another example .
you may think that &apos;s just a landscape of land , and the bottom part was manipulated .
but this picture is actually completely packed out of photos of different places .
personally , i personally think that it &apos;s easier to create a place than finding a place , because you don &apos;t have to take a compromise with the ideas in your head .
but it requires a lot of planning .
and when i had this idea in winter , i knew i needed several months to try and try to find the different places of the puzzle .
for example , the fish was taken on a trip .
the bank comes from another place .
the underwater part comes from a rock .
and yes , i even cut the house up on the island in red to make it look a swedish look .
to get a realistic outcome , it &apos;s going to go from me to planning .
i always start with a sketch , an idea .
and it &apos;s about the combination of the different images .
and here &apos;s a very well planned piece .
and when you make good footage , the result can be pretty beautiful , and also quite realistic .
so it &apos;s all the tools , and the only thing that we see is our imagination .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to talk to you about why so many electronic health projects failed .
and i think the most important point is that we stopped talking with our patients .
and one of the things that we introduced on the bicycle morning was to put a major audience audience .
it &apos;s not particularly scientifically scientific -- it &apos;s a cup of coffee , or tea , and the patients , families , family , &quot; how do we go ?
how can we help you ? &quot;
and we think we want to think that this is one of the main problems , why everyone -- maybe most of the electronic health projects : because we stopped listening .
this is my wlan-waage . a very simple thing .
she &apos;s got a button .
and every morning i turn on .
and yes , i have a job , as you might recognize .
i put my job at 95 pounds .
it works very simple : every time i go on the floor , you send my data on google health .
and they &apos;re also being called by my general doctor , so he can see where my weight is , and not just the moment i need kardiological support or something , but also with a look at the past .
but there &apos;s something else .
maybe you &apos;re familiar with this , i &apos;ve got over 4,000 followers on twitter .
so every morning i turn on my wlan-waage and people talk to me before i sit in the car , &quot; for lunch , just a little salad today , lucien . &quot;
but this is the net , which can happen , because this is the group of pack , co-forced , to help patients , because that could be used against obesity , or could patients smoke it to smoke .
but it could also be used to get people from their chairs and bring them to play some kind of play to control their health better .
next week comes on the market .
there &apos;s going to be a little blood pressure device that you put on an iphone or something .
and it will allow people to measure their blood pressure from home , send it to their doctor , and for example , to share it with others , for something more than 100 dollars .
at this point , the patients come into play . they can &apos;t just take control of the control , the captain on their own ship , but they can also help us with public health in the face of the challenges that we have , and so on .
do they use the easy to use and start embracing them with this , patients in the team .
and you can do that through these techniques , but also crowdsource .
and one of the things we did , i want to share with you through a short video .
we have all naviptions systems in our cars .
maybe even in our phones .
we know exactly where all the money dispensers are around .
we know one more where all the gas stations are .
and sure , we can find fast food chains .
but where would the next aed , to help this patient ?
we &apos;ve wondered , and nobody knew it .
no one knew where the next rescue of life was in this moment .
so , what did we do ? we did crowdsourcing in the netherlands .
we built a website and asked a human mass , &quot; if you see an aed , please share with us where he is , &quot; because sometimes he &apos;s closed during business times , of course .
and over 10,000 aeds have been made in the netherlands .
the next step was to find the apps .
and we designed an ipad app .
we &apos;ve developed an app for layar , extended reality to find these aeds .
and if you &apos;re in a city like maastrizes and someone collapses , you can use your iphone , and within the next few weeks , your microcell-mobile cell phone can save the next aed .
and today , we don &apos;t just want to be as anoble as the product is called , but also , as anoble 4us .
and we want to put this on a global level .
and we &apos;re asking our colleagues all over the world , from other universities , to help us behave like kling points , to crowdsource these aeds around the world .
and if you &apos;re in holiday and someone collapses , it &apos;s your own relatives or somebody else , you can find an aed .
the other thing that we want to ask is that companies are helping us all over the world in predicting these aeds .
this could be weird , or a technician for example , just to make sure that the stated aale is still in his place .
please help us and try to make the health not just better , but take the hand .
thank you .
today i &apos;m going to report by unexpected discoveries .
i work in the solar technology industry .
and my little startup wants us to lead to conservation by ...
... put it on .
here &apos;s a quick video about what we do .
oh . one moment .
it may take you to be charged .
now , we can just skip this -- i &apos;ll just jump through the video .
no .
that &apos;s not ...
okay .
solar technology is ...
oh , my time is over ?
okay . thank you .
so a few years ago , i started a program to get the stars in technology and design , to take a year and work in an environment that is so much , what they actually hate , we &apos;ve been working in the government .
the program is called &quot; code for america , &quot; and it &apos;s a bit like peace for geeks .
we choose a couple of fellows every year , and we &apos;re going to let them work with buildings .
instead of sending them into the third world , we send them in rathons .
and they developed great apps , working with urban workers .
but what they really do is to show what is possible today with technology .
so they meet al .
al is a hydrant in the city of boston .
this is when he looks for a date , but what he really is looking for is someone who &apos;s released him , because he knows he &apos;s not very good at healing when he &apos;s a meter of a foot .
how did he get to look for this particular kind of help ?
we had a team last year of fellows in boston , the code for america program .
they were there in february , and the last february has done a lot .
and they realized that the city never put off these hydrant hydrants .
but a particular fellow , a man named erik richards elel-ober , still noticed something else , and that was that the residents were free to break the sidewalks , right before these parts .
so he did what every good developer would do , he wrote an app .
it &apos;s a nice little app , where you can adopt a fire hydrant .
you &apos;re going to be able to break up to him if it &apos;s snowing .
if you do that , you can give him a name , and he called the first al .
if you don &apos;t do that , somebody can take away you .
so there &apos;s a nice little game dynamic .
this is a modest little app .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of the 21 apps written in the last year .
but she does something no other government does .
it &apos;s expanding .
there &apos;s this guy in the i.t. department of honolulu , who has seen that he could use this app , not for snow , but , in order for the citizens to earthami classises .
it &apos;s very important that these seals work , but people steal the batteries .
so he got the citizens to check them .
and then seattle decided to use the app to clean up the citizens to clean up the clogged gullys .
and the chicago has just introduced it , so people release the buywalks , if it &apos;s snoying .
we now know nine cities that are planning to use this app .
and it &apos;s related to friction , organic , of course .
if you know something about government technology , you know it doesn &apos;t usually work .
the model of software takes a few years .
we had a team that worked last year on a project in boston for three people two and a half months .
it was about a way to figure out what the right public schools are for their children .
we &apos;ve been told later that when it comes to the normal canals , it would have taken over two years and cost it about two million dollars .
and that &apos;s nothing yet .
there &apos;s a project in california right now , which has cost the taxpayer so far two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this on every level of government .
so , an app that &apos;s written in a few days , and then it &apos;s spread from selildness , is a kind of a shot of the web on the institution of government .
she shows how the government could work better -- not more like a private company , how many people think they should .
and not even like a tech company , but rather like the internet itself .
and that means free access , which means open and productive .
and that &apos;s important .
but more importantly , this app is that it represents a new generation that represents the problem of government -- not as the problem of a sales institution , but as a problem of collective play .
and this is a very good news , because it shows that we &apos;re very good in the collective act with digital technology .
now there &apos;s a big community of people making tools that we need to take things effectively together .
it &apos;s not just &quot; code for america , &quot; there are hundreds of people in the entire country who write up and write government apps every day in their own communities .
they didn &apos;t give up the government .
they &apos;re terrible frustrated with their , but they don &apos;t complain about it .
and these people know what we &apos;ve lost from the eyes .
and that &apos;s when you all forget your feelings about politics and the snake in the workplace and all the other things that we really enjoy is government , in the words of tim o &apos;s &quot; what we can &apos;t do in common . &quot;
today , a lot of people have given up the government .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , please , i want you to think about it because things change .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is in change .
and because the government will take their power out of us -- remember , &quot; we the people ? &quot; -- how we think about it , will affect how this change is happening .
i didn &apos;t know much about government when i started this program .
and as many people , i thought it was mainly about choosing people in a office .
now after two years , i &apos;ve come to the conclusion that it &apos;s especially on community rats to go .
this is the call center for service and information .
there you typically come out when you &apos;re in your town 311 .
if you ever have the chance to work in your cities center , like our fellow scott silverman as part of the program -- in fact , you &apos;re all going to see that people who call the government because of many different problems , including a marrat in their house .
scott gets this ancestor .
it &apos;s &quot; marrat &quot; in the official database .
and he doesn &apos;t really have an idea . he &apos;s beginning to start with the beast of the pirate .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , can you just open all the doors in your house and play very loud music , and see if that &apos;s the cattle ? &quot;
and that worked . applause for scott .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the thylacine rats .
it wasn &apos;t just a call center .
it has an app , a web and manual app , called &quot; citizen connect . &quot;
we didn &apos;t write this app .
this is the work of very clever people at the office of the new urban settlement in boston .
one day -- this is an actual report -- this was in this : &quot; marrat in my trash island . can &apos;t say if she &apos;s dead .
how do i get them away ? &quot;
but what happens to &quot; citizen connect . &quot;
scott underkept by human being .
but on &quot; citizen connect &quot; is all public , so everybody can see it .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
and the next post that we got was , &quot; i went over there , found the garbage bag behind the house .
marrat ? yes . life ? yap ? yap .
turned out the trash island . went home .
good night , honey marrat . &quot;
pretty simple .
this is great . this is what digital this is doing .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how to crowdsource the government .
but it &apos;s also a great example of the government as a platform .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition of the platform .
i &apos;m more likely to talk about a platform for people to help themselves and help others .
a citizen helped another citizen , but the government played a central role here .
they connected these two people .
and you could have put them together with government services when these need , but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative to government services .
if a neighbor helps the other , we develop our communities .
let &apos;s call the animal pressure , it costs a lot of money .
one of the most important things is we need to think that government is not the same as politics .
and most people understand that they think that one is the input of the others .
that our contribution to the system is that .
how often do we choose a political leader -- and sometimes we used a lot of energy to choose a new political leader -- and then we get back and expect that the government , our values reflect , and then not much changed ?
this is because the government like a further ocean is and politics are the top inches .
and what is below is what we call bureaucracy .
and we use this word with such contempt .
but it &apos;s this contempt that we own , and for the we are paying to be something that is working against us , something else , and then we made ourselves .
people seem to think politics is sexy .
if we want these institution to work for us , we need to make bureaucracy sexy .
because that &apos;s where the real government works .
we need to take care of the machinery of government .
so the headpayer has done it .
have you seen these guys ?
it &apos;s a group of concern , which wrote a very detailed 325 screen report , which is an answer on the sec memo about the law reform .
this is not politically active , which is bureaucratic .
well , for those of us who gave up the government , it &apos;s time that we think about the world that we want to leave our children .
you have to introduce the enormous challenges that you have to imagine .
do we really believe that we have to achieve what we need to achieve without improving the institution that &apos;s in the name of all of us ?
a government is absolutely necessary , but it has to be more efficient .
the good news is that technology makes it possible to interpret the function of the government in a way that can actually do something by empowering society .
and there &apos;s a generation that grew up the internet , and the knows that it &apos;s not so hard to do things in common , you have to build the only systems .
now the average age of our fellows is 28 , so i &apos;m , unfortunately , almost one generation older than most of you .
this is a generation that grew up to see their voice for granted .
they &apos;re not fighting this struggle that we all fight , which is how to talk to them ; they &apos;re all allowed to talk .
you can tell your opinion , on every channel at any time , and you do it .
so , if you &apos;re faced with the government , you don &apos;t care so much about using your voices .
they use their hands .
they use their hands to write applications that improve the government .
and these apps let us use our hands to improve our communities .
this could be , you know , dripping off a hydrant hydrant , uncharted , to turn a frog with a metal rat .
and sure , we could have released these hydrant hydrant all the time , and many people do it .
but these apps are like small digital memories that we &apos;re not only consumers , and we &apos;re not only consumers who pay taxes and gains .
we are more than that , we are citizens .
and we &apos;re not going to improve the government until we improve the civil citizenship .
so the question i have for you here : if it &apos;s about the great , important things we need to do together , all together , are we going to be a lot of voices , or will we be a lot of hands ?
thank you .
usually my role in it is to explain the people how wonderful the new technologies that are coming up , and i thought i &apos;d be here under friends , i would tell you what i really think is going on , and actually try and understand what &apos;s really going on , with these incredible deforestation .
i &apos;m going to start to show you a single , boring slide .
you might just show the slide .
this is a slide i picked up from my folder .
i don &apos;t care about the details of the slide , but rather the general form .
this slide shows data from us about the performance of risc processors with the performance of a local area network .
the interesting thing here is that this slide , like other people , which we often meet in our field , are a kind of semi-logarithmic curve .
in other words , every step here is equivalent to a power scale .
and this is a new thing that we need to use this guy to use scale to semi-logarithmic curves in the field of technology .
something very strange is happening here .
this is essentially what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
so , if you could make the light again .
another thing , because i &apos;m going to draw something on the paper here .
now , why do we draw graphs in technology on semi-logarithmic curves ?
the reason for this is when i draw it on a normal curve , where , say , this is the years of a way , so the time of a way , and this is an indication of the technology that i want to illustrate with a graph , which is ridiculous .
that &apos;s what you see .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
now , if i want to record another technology , let &apos;s say a transportation technology , then it would be very disreasonable on the semi-logarithmic scale , in form of a flat line .
but if something happened here , this is what it changes .
so , if transportation technology would continue as fast as the microprocessor technology , then we could get into a taxi and get into 30 seconds in tokyo .
but that &apos;s not so fast .
there was never before in history for the history of technology , this kind of recursitive growth , which will increase all of the few years exponentially .
the question i want to ask you is , if you look at this exponential curves , you &apos;re not going to go on forever .
it &apos;s not possible that everything is available forever and as fast as now .
there are two options .
either it becomes a classic curve like this , until something completely new comes from , or it &apos;s going to happen here .
it &apos;s about it .
well , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think something like this is going to happen .
is that really , then that means we are right now in the middle of a transition .
we &apos;re here on this line , in a transition from the past world to a new kind of world .
so the question i want to ask you , and i &apos;m also a lot of times , is like this new world ?
what is this new state that takes the world slowly ?
because the transition seems very , very confusing to be in the middle of it .
when i was a kid , there was the future somewhere in 2000 and people talked about what would happen in the year 2000 .
now we have a conference where people talk about the future , and you realize that the future is still in 2000 .
we &apos;re not going to go .
so in other words , the future is a year of every year since i &apos;m on this world .
i think the reason for that is we realize that anything is going on .
the transition . we can feel it all .
and we know that right now it doesn &apos;t make sense to try and look at 30 or 50 years into the future , because it will be so different that a simple calculation of what we &apos;re going to do now doesn &apos;t make sense .
so i want to talk about what that might be , this transition in which we are right now .
to do this , i &apos;m first going to talk about some other things , which have nothing to do with technology or computers .
because i think about this really , i think , we have to go back and look at the thing on a longer scale .
and that &apos;s what i want to look at at the time scale of life .
i think the overall picture makes sense when you split it into some billion steps .
so let &apos;s go back , and it was 2.5 billion years , and the earth was a big , sterile fish of a lot of it .
so if you look at the way these chemicals were organized , then there &apos;s a pretty good picture about how they did it .
i also think there are theories that begin to understand how everything with rna has started , but i &apos;m going to tell you a simplistic story of what is that at that time , small oil droples , which had different kinds of representation for chemicals .
some of these oil dropoons contain a special combination of chemicals that allowed them to integrate other chemicals from outside and to grow .
all the ones that were so , they began to divide .
these little oil dropons were in the sense the most primitive cell form .
however , these oil drobs weren &apos;t about living in the today &apos;s sense , because every single one of them was just a small , random recipe of chemicals .
and every time it divided , the chemicals have been distributed to inequal amounts of chemicals .
so every drock was a little bit different .
in fact , the droplet , which had one for growth , had faster than others and integrated more chemicals and more chemicals from outside and divided faster .
so these guys tend to survive longer and increase them in scale .
so this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but interestingly , if these drip drobs learned a trick about abstraction .
in any way that we don &apos;t quite understand , these drobs have learned the ability to write information .
they &apos;ve learned to store the recipe of the cell as information , and in a particular chemical form that we call dna .
in other words , they found in this intellectual , evolutionary species , which allowed them to write what they were doing , so that this information could be stored and copied .
and the amazing thing about that is that this kind of information is going to be about the time of 2.5 billion years ago , in which they stayed in the same .
in fact , the recipe for us , which is our genes , from the exact same code and the same type .
and every human being uses exactly the same letters and the same code .
we are as far as we can write only the pleasure of ourselves in this code .
and i have a hundred micrograms of a white pulsing , which i &apos;m trying to keep in airports of security .
in it , what i &apos;ve done is , i took this code -- the code made out of normal letters , which we use for symbolic -- and i wrote my business card on a piece of dna , and i have written it 10 ^ 22 times .
so if someone wants a hundred million copies of my business card , i have enough for everybody in this room and even for anyone in this world , and it &apos;s right here .
if i was in fact , i would have been an ego , then i would have written it on a virus and released it in the room .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
it was an interesting step of dna .
and the emergence of these cells -- it made them happy for another billion years .
but then another thing happened , very interesting step , where things were completely different , which is that these cells started to communicate and exchange information , so communities evolved from cells .
i don &apos;t know if you knew that , but bacteria can actually replace dna .
this is the reason why it grows to antibiotics .
some bacteria have figured out how to think of penicillin and have this information with other bacteria in the dna , and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin , because the bacteria are communicating to each other .
now this communication allowed the reasons for communities to be in a certain sense in the same boat ; they were synergy .
so they either survived , or they went together , and that meant that if a community was successful , all the individuals were repeated more often , and they were missing by evolution .
it &apos;s now where these communities are so close to where these communities are determined to write the recipe for the whole community in a wall chain on the dna .
and the next interesting phase took about another billion years .
at that point , we have multiple seas communities , communities of many different scales , which combined as individual organism .
in fact , we &apos;re also such a multivent community .
we have a lot of cells that are not on their own .
your skin cells are useless without heart cells , muscle cells , brain cells and so on .
so these communities began to continue to develop , so that the level of which evolution was happening , no longer the individual cell , but the whole cell community that we call organism .
the next step was now within these communities .
the cell communities started to abstract information .
and they developed special structures which didn &apos;t make anything else to process information within the organism .
and these are the neural structures .
so the neurons are the information processing apparatus that have built these cell communities .
they started to train specialists within the community , special structures , which were responsible for learning and understanding information .
and this was the brain , and the nervous system of these communities .
that gave them an evolutionary advantage .
because at that point , an individual -- learning happened within time of a single organism , rather than about this evolutionary period of time .
so one organism could learn , for example , not to eat a certain fruint , because they made bad and made it sick , the last time he ate them .
now , this could happen within the lifespan of a single organism , whereas hundreds of thousands of years earlier , because this information had to be learned evolutionary from the individuals that died because of these frustrations of information , they weren &apos;t there yet .
so the nervous system has the evolutionary process associated with this particular information structure , because evolution could now be within an individual perspective .
she was able to work in a time-lapse learning system .
what happened after that is that the individual organisms found a way to communicate each other .
as an example , the most sophisticated we know about this kind of communication is the human language .
it &apos;s a quite amazing invention when you think about it .
i have a very complicated , fuzzy and confusion idea in my head .
i &apos;m sitting here , and basically , in the course of some sense , i &apos;m going to sit in the hope of creating a kind of confused idea in your head , which has a certain resemblance with my original idea .
so we take something very complicated , turning it into sound to make a sequence of sound , and produce something very complicated in the heads of others .
so this allows us to work again as a unified organism .
and what we actually did , we , the humanity , is we started abstracting .
we &apos;re going through the same levels , which have grown through multi-cell organisms -- the abstraction of our methods , how we classify data , process .
the invention of language for example was a small step in that direction .
the operator , computers , videos , cd roms and so on , are all our specialized mechanisms that we built in our community to be able to have this information .
and it connects us all together to something that is much bigger , and also able to continue to develop faster than we &apos;ve been .
so today , evolution can happen in the time of microseconds .
you &apos;ve also seen a little bit of evolution of evolution where he showed a little bit of evolution in &quot; convoltary &quot; program , right before your eyes .
so now we &apos;ve regraded the time of time .
the first steps of history , which i told you , gave you a billion years a piece .
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , a few hundred million years .
then the night steps , like language and so on , are less than a million years .
and these next steps , like electronics , seem to be very few decades .
the process feeding itself , and so , i think , i think car catalytic is the word for -- if something changes the speed speed .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
and i think that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing in this exploding curve .
we see the process of self-feeding itself .
i live a living from building computers and i know that i &apos;m using the mechanism i &apos;m using to build computers , don &apos;t use it , without the recent design in computer technology .
my current activity is to design objects with such a high complexity that it &apos;s impossible to design this in the traditional sense .
i don &apos;t know what every single transistor does in the commitment machine .
it has billions of those .
instead , what i &apos;m doing , and what the designers of thinking machines are doing is we think in a certain level of abstractional level , which is the machine and the machine of something that goes far beyond our capabilities , better and faster than we could ever do .
and it makes it partly with methods that we don &apos;t even understand .
one way , which is particularly interesting , and what i used to use recently is the evolution itself .
we put an evolutionary process in the machine that &apos;s going on in the microwave area .
in order to call an example , in the most extreme cases , we can create a program which is designed out of random ininstructions .
we say , &quot; computers , generic please , a hundred million randomly chosen sequences of ininstructions .
now , i &apos;m going to take all those random instructions out of , perform all the programs , and choose the ones who are at the bottom of my mind . &quot;
so in other words , i define what i want .
let &apos;s say i want to take numbers , that would be a simple example , which i &apos;ve used for it .
so , find programs that allow the former numbers .
of course , the chance of randomly elected inproductions is very small that they just form numbers , so they don &apos;t actually get the instructions that actually do this .
but one of those of you may be lucky about two numbers into the right order .
now i &apos;m saying , &quot; computers , take the 10 percent of the sequences , which have come from the next .
we put these down , listy the rest .
now all of reproductions , all the remaining , the numbers in the best .
and with a method of reconnecting , analog to reproduction . &quot;
take two programs and they produce children through the exchange of their subroutines , and the kids who have the characteristics of the subroutines of the two programs .
so i have a new generation of programs that came through combinations of programs , which have come slightly closer to the preference than others .
say , &quot; please repeat this process . &quot;
put them back .
run some mutations maybe .
and try again with a different generation .
all these generations only need a few milliseconds .
and so i can run through a million years of evolution over millions of years , or in more complicated cases , some hours .
and finally , i get programs that can take numbers perfectly naturally .
in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i could have ever written by hand .
if i look at these programs , i can &apos;t say how they work .
i tried to understand them .
it &apos;s worn and strange programs .
but they do the job .
i know and i &apos;m sure that they do the job , because they come from hundreds of thousands of programs , which have done the job .
because your life depended on whether you did the job right .
i sat together in a 747 minsky with marvin minsky , herer a card and says , &quot; oh look . look at this .
you know , this airplane is made up of 100,000 pieces , which work together to make their flight safer . &apos; don &apos;t make you more comfortable ? &quot;
we know that a developing development process is not as valid to it .
so we &apos;re starting to rely on computers for a process which is very different from the classical engineering creatures .
he allows us to do a lot higher complexity than it would allow the normal methods to produce .
and yet , we don &apos;t really understand the possibilities .
so , similarly , we overhaul technology .
we use these programs now to make the computers much faster , so that we can make these processes even faster .
so it creates a feedback feedback .
it gets faster and faster and i think that &apos;s why it seems so confusing .
because all these new technologies of themselves are feeding themselves .
we put down .
we are at a point , which is analog at the time , when cell organisms have evolved to grow multi-cell organisms .
so we &apos;re the amoise and we can &apos;t quite make what the hell we are actually creating .
we are in the middle of this space .
but i really believe that after we get there .
i think it &apos;s very high to tell us that we are the end product of evolution .
and i think we all here are part of the creation of what &apos;s next .
now , lunch is before and i think i &apos;m going to hear before i &apos;m left .
my story starts right here in rajasthan , about two years ago .
i was in the desert sky with sufi-singer in the desert with sufid singer .
we talked about nothing changed since the age of ancient indian era , &quot; mahabharata . &quot;
if we wanted to travel back in the back , we were going to go into a car and tear over the sky .
now we do this with airplanes .
back then , when the great indian warrior prince had , he took a bow , he took a bow in the floor and water came out .
now we do this with power and machines .
we came to the conclusion that magic and magic were replaced with machines .
that really made me sad .
i got a fear of technology .
i was afraid that i could lose the ability to enjoy the sunset without the camera and without tweet to my friends .
i found that technology should make magic and not kill .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little silchwatch .
this piece of 50 years old technology became the most magical thing for me .
she became an original access to a world full of pirates and blinged ships and images in my imagination .
i came up with this as if we were sending clowatches and cameras out of it .
they were inspired by us .
and so i gave myself the world of technology to see how i could use it to make magic rather than killing the magic .
with 16 , i started to illustrate books .
when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a device that can connect readers across the world .
it can know how we hold it .
it can know where we are .
it takes pictures and text together , and animation , sounds and touch .
the storytelling always takes more senses .
but what do we do with this ?
i just go to khoya , an interactive ipad app .
here is , &quot; put your finger on every light . &quot;
and so -- here is , &quot; this box belongs ... &quot; i write my name .
and i get a character in the book .
and again , a letter falls down to me -- and the ipad knows through gps , where i &apos;m silent -- that &apos;s right to me .
the child in me is really excited about these possibilities .
i talked a lot about magic .
i don &apos;t mean a magician , and a kite , but the magic of childhood , those ideas that we all had as children .
fireflies in a glass found me quite exciting .
so you have to turn the ipad down and let the fireflies out .
and the light path through the rest of the book .
another idea that was fascinated as a child is that a whole galaxy can stick in a single murdrum .
and so every book , every single book , is going to be a little muriness that i &apos;m going to get here to the magic device in the device .
and this opens up a map .
fantasy books have always had maps , but these maps were static .
this map is growing and lighting and serves for guidance in the rest of the book .
she also shows in other places of the book .
i &apos;m going in here .
it &apos;s important for me to create something that is so important , but it &apos;s also very short .
this is the apsaras .
we &apos;ve all heard of feen and nylon , but how many people outside india know their indian colleagues , the apsaras ?
the poor apsaras were caught thousands of years in indras , in an old nazi book .
and we bring them back , in a more contemporary history for children .
a story that goes apart with new issues like the environmental crisis .
in the environmental crisis , a big problem of the last 10 years is that kids are sitting in their rooms , in their computers , without getting out of .
but now , with mobile technology , we can take our children into the natural world with their technology .
in an interaction of the book , you &apos;re sent to a search . you have to go out and collect the camera of the ipads of natural objects .
as a child , i had collections of story , stones , rocks and shells .
somehow , kids don &apos;t do that anymore .
this childhood ritual is brought back . you have to go out to make a picture of a flower and mark .
in another chapter , you have to have a piece of mri photography and mark .
so you actually create a digital collection of photographs that you can put online .
a kid in london shows the picture of a fucking and says , &quot; oh , today i &apos;ve seen a fusion . &quot;
a kid in india says , &quot; i &apos;ve seen a monkey . &quot;
this creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photographs that you actually recorded .
there &apos;s a variety of possibilities to connect the world and technology together .
in the next book , we &apos;re planning an interaction in which you use the video of the ipads and see through augmented reality , which is an animation that looks at a plant before the house .
at one point , the screen moves with leaves .
you have to make the sound of the wind , you &apos;re going to read bubbles and the rest of the bug .
we all move to a world where the natural forces of technology can come closer and live in the magic and technology .
we use the energy of the sun .
we bring our kids closer to the natural world and to the magic , fun and love of our childhood through the simple medium of a story .
thank you .
this is a really extraordinary honor for me .
i spend most of my time with people in classes , prison or death cells .
i spend most of my time with the social weakest in social form and in places where there are a lot of hopelessness .
to be here at ted , to hear and hear how stimulating this is , i gave a lot of power .
in the short time here , i became a clear one : ted has an identity .
you can say things here that have influence in the world .
and sometimes , if something comes about ted , it gets a meaning and strength that otherwise wouldn &apos;t have it .
i say that because i think identity is very important .
we &apos;ve seen some fantastic presentations .
i think we &apos;ve learned that the words of a textbook matter , but the words of a dedicated textbook are particularly meaningful .
as a doctor , you can do good . as a doctor , you can do more .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
i didn &apos;t learn this in my work as a lawyer .
i learned this from my grandmother .
i became big in a family , a traditional african-american household who was dominated by a therapist , and this rabbit was my grandmother .
she was a cat , strong woman , she had effect .
she had the last word in every family debate .
it was also the origin of many levels of success in our family .
she was the daughter of a slave family .
their parents were born in the 1840s of virginia as slaves .
it was born by 1880 , and the experience of slavery shaped it very much .
my grandmother was very strong , but she was also loving .
if i met her as a little boy , she came to me and huiled me .
they hit me so that i couldn &apos;t breathe . then they let me go .
one or two hours later , when i showed her , she came to me and said , &quot; bryan , do you feel my hug ? &quot;
and if i said no , they were hugging me again . if i said , &quot; yes , let me leave you . &quot;
she was something that made you want to be close to her .
the only problem was they had 10 children .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
sometimes if i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to get her attention .
my cousins were around everywhere .
i remember , i &apos;ve got to be eight or nine that i woke up one morning and went to the living room . all my cousins went around .
my grandmother was sitting at the end of the room and he looked at me .
first i thought that was a game .
i looked at it and smiles , but she looked very serious .
this was 15 or 20 minutes . then she stood up and came to me . she took me and said , &quot; come on , bryan . you and i have to talk . &quot;
i remember as if it was yesterday .
i &apos;ll never forget it .
she took me outside , and she said , &quot; bryan , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you have to promise that you don &apos;t say it . &quot;
i said , &quot; ah , grandma . &quot;
she said , &quot; judge ? &quot; i said , &quot; yeah . &quot;
she sat down , and she looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to know me watching you . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do everything you want to do . &quot;
i &apos;ll never forget that .
then she said , &quot; you &apos;ve got to promise me three things , bryan . &quot;
i said , &quot; ok , grandma . &quot;
she said , well , first of all , you &apos;ll love your mom .
she said , &quot; your mom is my baby , and you have to do with promise that you &apos;re going to take care of you . &quot;
i dreamed my mother , so i said , &quot; yeah , grandma , i &apos;m going to do that . &quot;
and she said , &quot; next i &apos;m going to turn out that you &apos;re always going to do the right thing , &quot; even though it &apos;s hard to do the right thing .
i thought , &quot; yeah , yeah , grandma . i promise . &quot;
after all , she said , &quot; the last thing you have to promise me is that you will never drink alcohol . &quot;
well , i was nine years old , and i said , &quot; yeah , grandma . i promise . &quot;
i grew up on the land , rural south and rural , and i have a brother who &apos;s older and a year older sister .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day , my brother came home and brought this sixpack beer with my sister and i went to the forest .
we are silly there just like otherwise .
then he took a drink , and he offered my sister &apos;s beer , and she took me , and she gave me one .
i said , &quot; no , no , no , no . you just do . i don &apos;t want a beer . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; well , do you . today we do that , you &apos;re also doing anything we do .
i had what , your sister had what was . go , drink a beer . &quot;
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to . just make your . &quot;
my brother looked at me .
he said , &quot; well , what &apos;s going on with you ? &quot;
then he looked at my face , and he said , &quot; oh no , you &apos;re not always doing crazy because of the conversation ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; grandma tells all the grandchildren that they &apos;re special . &quot;
i was devastated .
i &apos;m going to give you something .
i should probably not do that .
this is probably going to translate public .
i &apos;m a 52 years old , and i &apos;m standing there that i &apos;ve never drink a drop of alcohol .
i &apos;m not saying that because i think it &apos;s tuevable . i say that because identity means it .
if we create the right kind of identity , we can tell people around us things that they don &apos;t believe .
we can get them to do things that they thought they could not .
of course , my grandmother would tell all of their grandchildren , they &apos;re special .
my grandfather was during the prohibition in prison .
my uncle died at the alcohol of alcohol .
and she believed that this is the issues we have to care about .
i tried to say something about our ministry of justice .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
1972 were 300,000 people in arrest and prison in prison .
today , it &apos;s 2.3 million .
the united states today has the highest incarceration rate in the world .
seven million people are rely on currency or unconditional criminal consent .
in my opinion , mass incarcerators fundamentally changed our world .
in social and black parts of the population , despair are despair and hopelessness because of these changes .
one of three / ots of black and 30 is in high , in prison , on a currency , or unconditional anesthesia .
in urban communities all over the country -- from los angeles across philadelphia , in baltimore to washington -- are 50 to 60 percent of the black young men who either live in prison , in prison , or unconditional crimes .
but our system is not just shaped by questions that have to do with rasr. , and it &apos;s also made by poverty .
we have a justice system that you treat much better if you &apos;re a rich and guilty and guilty .
it doesn &apos;t affect the outcome .
but we seem to be very pleased with that .
politics from fear and anger has convinced us that these problems are not our problems .
we lost touch .
i find that interesting .
there are some very interesting developments there .
my home state of alabama takes you permanent to the right , if you &apos;re being convicted of it .
and here in alabama , 34 percent of the male black population still has lost their right response .
we predicted that in 10 years the rate of recognition is going to be so high than the end of the election law law .
the silence is fine .
i assure kids .
many of my clients are very young .
the united states of america is the only country in the world , the three-year children to death in prison .
in this country , there is children &apos;s life for the children who are unable to disintegrate .
we already have a lot of processes .
the only country in the world .
i paint people in death cells .
the death penalty question is an interesting question .
we think because you &apos;ve taught us that the real question is : has a human deserving to die for one of them ?
this is a very delicate question .
but you can also think differently about how we see our identity .
the other view is not , does anybody deserve death for a crime , but do we deserve it to kill ?
i find that fascinating .
the death penalty in america is defined by error .
on nine people we &apos;ve been executed , one that we have for innocent persuasion , which was released and released from the death row .
an amazing error rate . one of nine innocent .
i find that fascinating .
we would never let anyone fly with an airplane , if for nine planes , that lift one off .
but somehow we can do it from this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden .
it &apos;s not our struggle .
i &apos;m talking a lot about these questions .
i &apos;m talking about race and the question of whether we have the right to kill .
and it &apos;s exciting because i bring my students to my students , i talk about slavery .
i &apos;m talking about terrorism , the time against the reconstruction , until the first world war war .
we don &apos;t really know a lot about it .
but for the african-american americans in this country , it was a time of terror .
in many areas , people had to be afraid of lynchmobs .
or , you know , bombs .
it was the fear of terror that shaped her life .
these older people now come to me and say , &quot; mr , stevenson , they &apos;re talking , they &apos;re talking to people that they should stop saying that we have to stop to do the first time in our nation &apos;s history : after 9 / 11 . &quot;
they say , &quot; no -- tell people that we grew up with it . &quot;
and after the terrorism , of course , the rasacents came up and decades of rassistic submission and retirement .
and yet there is a dynamic in our country -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our history .
and that &apos;s why we don &apos;t really understand what our actions are in the historical context .
we &apos;re constantly breaking together .
we create new tensions and conflicts .
it &apos;s hard to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to approach the process of truth and reconciliation .
in south africa , people understood that the rasacents aren &apos;t going to break down without the willingness to truth and reconciliation .
even after the genocide in rwanda , there were these trade-offs , but not in this country .
i &apos;ve held some talks in germany about the death penalty .
it was fascinating because one of the scientists stood up after my talk and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply disturbing , you talk about listening . &quot;
he said , &quot; in germany , there &apos;s no death penalty .
and of course , it can never give you more . &quot;
it was quite silent . then a woman said , &quot; with our story , it &apos;s impossible that we &apos;ve ever been killing ourselves for the systematic kill of people .
it would be to be aware of us , aware of ourselves . &quot;
i thought about it .
what it would feel like to live in a world where german state people set up , especially , if they were incomplete , would not be a lot of jews .
it would be inarable .
it would be a knowledge .
and yet , here in this country , in the states of the old south , we set people down -- here &apos;s the risk , to be convicted of death , 11 times higher when the victims is white , at 11 times higher if it &apos;s black , and the victim knows -- in the same states , in which the body is in black .
and yet there &apos;s this mental feedback .
i think our identity is threatened .
if we don &apos;t deal with it , with these difficult topics , the positive and wonderful things are also affected .
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity .
we love entertainment .
but ultimately , these realities are being overimposed by suffering , abuse , disagreements .
i think it &apos;s important to unite both .
because we actually talk about the hope that we need more hope , more engagement , more commitment to be able to produce in a complex world .
for me , it means time to think and talk about the poor , the disadvancing , which will never be at ted .
but thinking about a way that is embedded in our own lives .
we all have to believe in the end things that we can &apos;t see .
we do that . so we are so rational , so we value intellect .
innovation , creativity , and development isn &apos;t just coming from our heads .
they come from ideas that are driven by believing in our hearts .
it &apos;s this head-up of the heart that i think is going to drive us , not just to be open for all the bright and exciting things , but also for the dark and problematic .
vaclav hakis , the great cheechian politician , once said .
&quot; when we fought in eastern europe , we wanted to do all kinds of things , but what we needed most was hope , a mental orientation , the willingness to be , sometimes , to be hopeful and witness . &quot;
this mental orientation is the core of what i believe that the ted community must be engaged in .
there &apos;s no trend around technology and design that allows us to be completely human , as long as we don &apos;t have eyes and ears for poverty , and we have injustice and injustice .
i want to warn you . this kind of identity challenge a lot more of us than if we don &apos;t care about it .
it &apos;s going to touch them deeply .
as a young lawyer , i hated the great privilege to meet pink parks .
the woman &apos;s parks came back to montgomery , where she had two of her oldest friends traod these elders , john never carr , who had organized the montgomery bus -- an incredible african-american -- and virginia durr , a white one .
so these women came and kept themselves .
and then they called me , and then he said , &quot; oops , woman &apos;s going to the city . we want to talk .
do you want to come and listen ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yeah , very happy . &quot;
she said , &quot; and what are you going to do when you &apos;re here ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
and i went over and i just heard .
it was always so inspiring , so upset .
one day i was sitting there , and i heard these women , and after a couple of hours , ghana turned to me to tell us , &quot; well , bryan , tell me what &apos;s right to it . &quot;
what do you try to achieve ? &quot;
i started with my usual talk .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to go against injustice .
wr want to help people who are innocent .
we want to fight bias and discrimination in the criminal justice system .
we want to make life care without a related endeavor for children .
we want to do something against the death penalty company .
we want to lower the number of statements .
we want to create mass incarcerators . &quot;
i thought my usual talk , and then she looked at me and said , &quot; mhmm . mhmm . mhmm . &quot;
she said , &quot; it will make you very , very tired . &quot;
then he rejected me to me , put a finger on my face and said , &quot; and that &apos;s why you have to be very , very brave . &quot;
and that &apos;s why i think the ted community should be .
we have to have ways of asking . we have this challenges to ask : these problems , suffering .
because ultimately our humanity depends on our humanity .
i learned very simple things in my work .
i learned a few very simple things .
that we &apos;re all more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
i think that &apos;s true of every person on the planet .
if someone lies , it &apos;s not just a liar .
if somebody takes something that doesn &apos;t hear him , he &apos;s not just a tooth .
even who kills someone is not just a killer .
and because that is , there &apos;s a basic human dignity that has to respect the law .
i also believe in many parts of this country , and with security in many parts of the earth , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i don &apos;t think so .
i think in many places , the opposite of poverty is justice .
and finally , i believe that even though it &apos;s so dramatic , so beautiful and inspiring , we &apos;re not being measured at the end of our technology , not the things that we &apos;re developing , not to our intellect and minds .
finally , a society will not be measured by how they do their rich and powerful and privileged , but how they deal with the poor , the incarceration .
because in this context , we start to understand the truly amazing things that make us .
sometimes i lose the balance . a story at the end .
sometimes i push too much .
i &apos;m going to get tired of all of you .
sometimes these ideas predict our thinking , on very important ways .
i assure these kids to be convicted of very hard punches .
i go to the study of prison , and i visit a client who may be 13 or 14 years old , and to be the adult in court .
then i ask myself , how could this happen ?
how can a judge turn somebody into something that he doesn &apos;t ?
the judge looked at him as adults , but i see a kid .
one night i stayed too long and i thought , oh my goodness , if a judge can turn us into something else , he must have magic forces .
right , bryan , the judge has magic forces .
you should also wish you .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t really think anymore , i began to work on a hook .
i had a 14-year-old black boy as a client .
and i started with this revenue . the overscription was , &quot; regulating , my poor , 14-year-old vimer like a privileged , white , 75-year-old manager . &quot;
in my head , i explained that misbehavior is the state of state and the police as well as being more effective .
there was a crazy line that there is nothing more computing in this country , that there &apos;s still misbehavior .
the next morning i woke up , and i didn &apos;t know if i was just dreaming about this crazy breaker or actually writing him .
and i didn &apos;t just write it , but i sent him to the court .
a few months went on and i had just forgotten everything .
but finally , i decided , my god , i have to be in court , and this crazy case .
i went to the car , and i was really overwhelmed .
so i went to the court .
and i thought that &apos;s so hard , so painful .
finally , i went from my car and i went to the court .
when i walked up the stairs to the court , there was an older black man , black man in the court .
when he saw me , he came to me and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yeah . &quot;
he came to me and hupped me .
then he whispered to the ear .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
and i have to say , there was power .
it touched something very deep to me , identity , the ability of every single one to contribute to a community of hope .
well , i went to court court .
once the judge saw me .
he said , &quot; mr. stevenson , did you put this crazy impact ? &quot;
i said , &quot; yeah . &quot; and then we started arguing .
increasingly more people came in , simply because they were angry .
that i wrote these crazy things .
police officers came in and they were proposing and office employees .
in the hand , the court was full of people who were angry , that we talked about skin color , about inequality .
from my eye angle , i saw the janitors and go down .
he used to look through the window and could hear the whole tohuwbeans .
he went and down .
finally , this older black man came out with a very high facial pulse in the courthouse and sat directly behind me , almost on the defense bank .
10 minutes later , the judge announced a break .
during the recess , a police officer came in , that the janitors were in court court .
this deputy ran over to the older black .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do in the courthouse ? &quot;
the older black man stood up . he saw the deputy , then he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;ve come to tell this young man , you don &apos;t lose the goal of the eyes . give it up . &quot;
i &apos;ve come to ted because i believe that many of you have understood that the moral pender of the universe is far too far , but that it &apos;s justice .
that as humans , we are not completely evolved as long as we don &apos;t care about human rights and basic values .
that our lives are connected to the survival of every single one .
that we need to connect our visions of technology and design , from entertainment and creativity with humanity , pity and justice .
and most of all , i &apos;d like to share with you that , just as you can say , just don &apos;t say the goal of the eyes . give them not .
they have seen an obvious wish in this audience , this community , to help them and do something .
what else can we do ?
bryan stevenson : well , there are opportunities everywhere .
if you live in california , there &apos;s a census in this spring where it &apos;s actually about making a effort to do something about the power of money , which is otherwise in the politics of punishment .
here , in california , for example , you &apos;re going to get a billion dollars to the death penalty , a billion dollars .
and yet , 46 percent of all psychiatric mammals don &apos;t end with a prescription .
56 percent of rape are not coming from trial .
here &apos;s the opportunity to do something .
this reference in order to suggest the money in more security force and security .
i think there &apos;s opportunities everywhere .
during the last three decades , the crime rate is great down in america .
this fact is often put into a relationship with the increased incarceration .
what would you say to someone who believes this ?
well , in fact , the number of nonviolent crime has not changed very much .
most of the mass incarcerators in this country didn &apos;t really appear in the class of nonviolent crime .
it was the misguided track ride against drugs .
that &apos;s why the traditional ones are coming in the prison inmates .
we &apos;ve been sweating ourselves from the rhetoric of punishment .
now , we have &quot; three-verding &quot; laws that bring people up to the lattations , for a bicycle theft , for the theft of the good , rather than you make them back to the sacrifice .
i think we need to do more to help people who have become victims of a patient , not less .
and i think that our current marks don &apos;t help us .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
bryan , you really have a string of a string here .
they &apos;re an inspirational personality .
thank you for having to be at ted . thank you .
am salmon death takes an increased risk risk .
two : ubuntu in somalia . speakers : pepper spray of police .
four : malignant kartelle . speakers five : dangerous close ships .
six : more social . speakers : 65 deaths .
8 : tsunami amiwarning : cyberattacks
different speakers : drug war . mass destruction . tornado .
recession . linguomsday . egypt . syria .
crisis . death . disaster .
oh my god .
so these are just a few of the clips i collected over the last six months -- but it could have been the last six days , or the last six years .
the fact is that the media prefer to show us negative topics , because our minds pay attention to these subjects .
and there &apos;s also a very good reason for that .
every second every day , our senses begin much more information than our brain can ever be .
and because we &apos;re not more important than our survival , the first stop place for all the information is part of our temporal lobe , the amygdala .
the amygdala is our early warning system , our risk detector .
and it turns out , and it turns through all the information on the search for anything in our environment .
so if we see the news , we prefer to look for negative news .
and the old adage , &quot; when it gets hot , demand is very true . &quot;
now , with all of our digital devices that will give us seven days , 24 hours a day , 24 hours a day , it &apos;s not a miracle that we are pessimistic .
it &apos;s not a miracle that everybody thinks it &apos;s always worse .
but maybe this is not the case .
maybe that &apos;s the reality .
maybe the enormous progress that we &apos;ve done in the last century has accelerated a series of forces , so that it will be possible to create us in the next three decades , to create a world of overchanging .
well , i &apos;m not saying we don &apos;t have a big problem -- climate crisis , wildlife , water -- and energy problems -- we have already .
and as humans , we &apos;re much better at looking at problems in very long terms , but they eventually end up starting to overcome .
let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve achieved in the last century , so we can anticipate the development .
in the last 100 years , the average life expectancy has more than doubled the average income of the world &apos;s inflation .
child mortality has a tenth of it .
it turns out that the food , electricity -- transportation and communication costs have increased a lot more .
steve pinker has shown us that we live in a very peaceful time of human history .
and according to charles kenny , the literacy rate is up in the past 130 years of 25 percent .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and many people forget this .
and we increase our expectations all the time .
in fact , we redefined poverty .
remember that a large percentage of americans , who live under the poverty line , access to electricity , water , toilets , refrigerators , television phones , solar phones and cars .
the richest capitalists of the last century , the empires of the earth , would never be able to dream of luxury goods .
the basis for a lot of these technologies , and these are growing expotentially .
my good friend ray kurzweil has shown us that every tool that is going to be the information technology , on the curve of moore &apos;s law , makes the price performance for all 12 to 24 months .
that &apos;s why the mobile phone costs about a million times less and less , and it &apos;s faster than a supercomputer from the &apos; 70s .
now look at this curve .
this is moore &apos;s law last hundred years .
notice two things on this curve .
first of all , how smooth it is -- in good times , in bad times , war or peace , beijing , depression .
this is the result of fast computers , the faster computers .
they slow down for none of our big problems .
also , despite your logarithmic waste on the left , it &apos;s going upwards .
so growth itself is accelerating itself .
and on this line , on the back of moore &apos;s law , we find a series of extraordinary technologies that are available to everyone .
&quot; cloud computing , &quot; something that i call my friends at autodesk &quot; calculus computing , &quot; sensors and networks , robots , 3d printers that allow the personal production to our planet , synthetic biology and artificial intelligence .
how many of you have seen the victory of ibm &apos;s heart watson at risk ?
that was grandios .
i &apos;ve been through the newspapers and looking for the best headlines i could find .
i love this : &quot; watson forces human opponors . &quot;
&quot; risk &quot; is not a simple game .
it &apos;s about understanding the nups of language .
imagine that this artificial intelligence , every owner of a mobile phone , would be available to each other .
four years ago , ray kurzweil and i launched a new university , called singularity university .
we bring our students all these technologies with special focus on how they can be used to solve the great challenges of humanity .
and every year , we ask the students to create companies and products and services that can live in a decade of a decade of people .
think about it , a group of students today can influence the lives of billions of people .
30 years ago , this would be ridiculous .
today we can put in dozens of companies that did exactly this .
when i think about making abundance , i don &apos;t mean a life of luxury for everyone on this planet ; it &apos;s about creating a life full of possibilities .
it &apos;s about creating scarce goods .
however , scarcity is conword , and technology is liberating the resources .
here &apos;s an example .
this is the story of napoleon iion in the middle of the 18th century .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
he invited the king of siam to dinner .
napoleons soldiers got silver bribe , napoleon himself .
the king of sion , though , got aluminum bribe .
aluminum , at this time , was the most valuable metal on the planet , more valuable than gold and plastic .
this is why the dome of the whington monuments made out of aluminum .
even though aluminum takes on 8.3 percent of the earth &apos;s mass , it &apos;s not as pure metal .
it &apos;s connected by oxygen and opiates .
but then the technology of electrolysis developed and made aluminum manufacturing so cheap that we use it with our limited mentality .
then let &apos;s put this analogy in the future .
we think of energy scarcity today .
ladies and gentlemen , we live in a planet of 17,000-times more energy than we consume every year .
16 terawatts energy heating all the 88 minutes on earth .
it &apos;s not about scarcity , the problem is accessible .
and there &apos;s good news .
in this year , you did it for the first time to reduce the cost of solar power in india to 50 percent of the gharial -- 8,000 rupees in comparison .
the cost for solar in the last year was 50 percent .
last month , this has been published with a study that shows that until the end of this decade in the sunny areas of the united states of solar six cents a whh , it &apos;s going to be 15 cents in national average .
and if we have an energy overshot , we &apos;re also going to have water abundance .
let &apos;s talk about water wars .
do you remember , as carl sagan &apos;s space vehicle in 1990 , when it was moved by saturn , back to earth ?
he took a famous photograph . how did it mean ?
&quot; a utopia blue dot . &quot;
because we live on a water planet .
we live on a planet that &apos;s covered to 70 percent with water .
yes , it &apos;s 9,5 percent fuel , two percent , and we &apos;re fighting by 0.5 percent of the water on the planet , but there &apos;s also hope .
and there are new technologies , not 10 or 20 years , but now .
it &apos;s new pathogens on the way , nano materials .
and from a conversation today with dean kaman , one of the innovators of do it , i want to share something with you -- he gave me permission -- he gave me the permission -- his technogy , which is called &quot; slingshot , &quot; and the size of many of you may have heard it . it &apos;s the size of a refrigerator .
it can produce a thousand gallons of clean water per day from different sources -- whether salt water , polluted water , latrine -- and all that for less than two cents a liter .
the president of coca-cola has just begun to launch a large test-like project in the developing world .
and if everything goes well , and i &apos;m very confident , then the coca-cola will apply this technology globally in 206 countries across the planet .
this is technology supporting innovation that we have today .
and we &apos;ve also seen this in mobile phones .
oh my goodness , we &apos;re going to reach the 70 percent reduction rate of mobile phones in developing countries to the end of 2013 .
just think that a masi warrior with a cell phone in the middle of kenya has a better mobile communication than president reagan 25 years ago .
and if you look for your smartphone on google , you have more access to knowing and information as president clinton 15 years ago .
they live in a world that has information and communication , as no one could have predicted .
and it &apos;s even better , the things that you and i &apos;ve spent several thousand dollars -- gps , hd video and photograph , libraries of books and music , technology , technology -- are now being dismaterialized and cheaper in your cell phone .
and the best thing about it is perhaps what we expect in health .
in the last month , i had the pleasure , with the quality markecal foundation called the &quot; $ 10 million crawers of x prize tricores . &quot;
we challenge teams all over the world , all these technologies to connect with each other in a mobile way that you can talk to the device , because it &apos;s equipped with ai , and you can test your blood values .
and to win , the device has to be a better diagnosis than a team of sophisticated doctors .
imagine this device . in the middle of a developing country , where there &apos;s no doctors , but 25 percent of the disease burden and 1.3 percent of the staff of health care .
if this device sequenced a pure or a dna virus that &apos;s not known , it &apos;s called the health care system and prevents a pandemic before its outbreak .
but now the biggest force that will lead us to a world of overshifting .
i call them &quot; the coming billion . &quot;
the white lines are for population .
we &apos;ve just crossed the seven-billion-second brand .
and by the way , the biggest abjection against a population explosion is a better education and diet throughout the world .
in 2010 , we had so close to two billion people online .
by 2020 , we rise from two billion to five billion internet users .
three billion new minds , which we &apos;ve never heard before , will be the global communication .
what do these people need ?
what are you going to consume ? what are you going to consume ?
and instead of a serious death , i see one of the biggest economic suits of the story .
these people represent multiple trillion dollars that are going to flow into the global economy .
and they &apos;re going to be healthier by the use of the tricoders , and they &apos;re trained to be trained by the khan academy , and that they have the opportunity to use 3d printers and so much more productive than ever before .
so what can three billion growing grow , healthy , educated , productive members of the human community ?
how about a sentence of new , never before deaf voices .
how about that , the oppressed , wherever they are , a voice to make attention and create change , for the first time ?
what are these three billion people going to bring ?
how about beialisch that we can &apos;t even predict ?
one of the things that i learned by the x prize is that little teams that are motivated by passion and focus can create extraordinary things , things that could create big companies and governments in the past .
i want to end with a story that really excites me .
there &apos;s a program that some might already know .
it &apos;s a game called mastery .
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
and it &apos;s a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids to explore how the protein is going to evolve .
according to its behavior , we can predict the structure and function .
and this is very important in medical science .
this has been a problem for supercomputer .
and this game was played by university professors and so on .
and it &apos;s now hundreds of thousands of people playing the game online .
and it turns out that today , the human pattern recognition is better the proteins than the best supercomputer .
and when these individuals came and looked at who &apos;s the best in the middle of the world , this wasn &apos;t an mit professor , no caluba student , it was somebody from england , manchester , a woman who was working as an assistant of business in the day , and at night , the best part of the world .
ladies and gentlemen , which gives me enormous trust in our future , the fact that today we have more power than individuals to imagine the great challenges of our planet .
we have access to an exponential technology .
we have the passion of a diy innovators .
we have the capital of techno-philanthroities .
and we have three billion new minds that we can work with online to master the new challenges , and to do what &apos;s needed .
we expect some extraordinary decades .
thank you .
i think we need to have something to make a difference worth of medical culture .
and i think it starts with a medical class , and i am .
and maybe i &apos;ve been in business for a long time when i can give up a piece of my own false preiler to allow this .
but before i come to the actual issue of my talk , let &apos;s start with a little bit of baseball .
hey , why not ?
we are the seasonal and move to the world championship .
we all love baseball , right ?
baseball is full of great statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
&quot; moneyball &quot; seems soon and turns around statistics and to use this great baseball team .
i &apos;m going to get into a statistic that i hope most of you have heard .
it &apos;s the average achievement of the bat .
we talk about a 300 , if a bat blows 300 .
that means that the player is safe at 10 beats .
this is called the ball in the outfield , and he comes up , he &apos;s not getting caught , and who &apos;s trying to throw the ball to the first base , it didn &apos;t get done in time and the tail was in safety .
three out of 10 .
do you know how to call a 300000-step in thailand baseball ?
well , really good , maybe an all-star star .
you know how to call a 400a ?
that &apos;s somebody in the rest of the way safely .
legendary -- like ted williams , the last major dotcom player , during a regular season , met over 400 times .
let &apos;s go back to my world of medicine , where i feel a lot of wealth , or maybe a little less likely to talk to you about that .
suppose you have a blind license , and you get overcovered to an assistant , which is the average performance 400 in terms of blind mental illness .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
imagine if you live in a certain area , and you have a beloved man with clogged heart disease , and you overcount that to a cardiologist , which is the average performance at the age of 200 .
but , you know what ?
it &apos;s much better this year . it &apos;s on the rise .
and it &apos;s a 257 .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
what do you think the average performance for a cardiologist or a nurse or an orthopedite , a national hero , should be a rescue ?
1,000 , very good .
the truth is that no one in the entire medicine knows what a good surgeon or a doctor should be or rescue or rescue .
however , what we do is we &apos;re doing each of them , including me to be in the world with the claim of perfect .
never make a mistake , but no one &apos;s going to mind the details of how to do this .
and that &apos;s the message i took in medical school .
i was a forced addiver student .
in high school , a student said that brian goldman would learn for a bloody test .
and so it was .
and i learned in my little roof in the sisters , in the sisters , of a general hospital , unfar from here .
i learned everything .
in my anatomant studies , i learned the origins and the tail of every musy , every branch of every branch , which runs away from the aorta and the ordinary calculus .
i even knew the differential diagnosis to classify renale tubules .
and i &apos;ve collected more and more knowledge .
and i was good , i sat down with cum laude .
and i left medical school with the impression that i knew , if i memorized everything and knew anything , or at least as long as possible , that i could be an imdute to do that .
and it worked for a time , until i met my wife .
i was resistant to a hospital hospital here in toronto as a woman to me in the emergency department of the hospital .
at this point , i was pointed up the kardiological layer in kardiological service .
and it was my mission when the emergency care council was looking for the emergency patients to study emergency patients .
and then getting feedback on my high doctor .
i studied a printer , and she was in respiratory distress .
and when i listened to her , she made clubs .
and when i heard her breast with the stethoskes , i could hear a crack noise of the sound on both sides , telling me that she suffered under congestre heart failure .
this is a state that is failing in the heart , instead of pump the entire blood , puts some part of the blood in the lung , and you can take that slowly , so the short speed came .
and that wasn &apos;t a hard diagnosis .
i asked them , and i went to treatment .
i gave her an immigrant . i gave her medicine to take the pressure from the heart .
i gave her medicine that we call diuretics that we call water pill , so that she took the liquid out .
and over a year and a half to two hours , she started feeling better .
i felt really good .
and i made my first mistake ; i sent them home .
i actually made two mistakes .
i sent them home without talking to my granddoctor .
i didn &apos;t take the links , and i did what i should have been , which would have been a call on my top doctor , so that he had a chance to make a sense .
and he knew it , he would have been able to raise additional information .
maybe i did it with good reason .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the aid doctor .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so able to take responsibility that i was so worried about my patients without having to contact it for my patients .
my second mistake was worse .
and so that i sent her home , i did a quiet voice in me , trying to tell me , &quot; goldman , no good idea . don &apos;t do that . &quot;
in real life , i was so happy that i asked the nurse , what was taking care of the girl , &quot; do you know it , if you go home ? &quot;
and the nurse thought about it , and he said , &quot; yeah , i think it will go well . &quot;
i remember when it was yesterday .
so i signed the dissection and a hospital truck and i came up with the home .
and i went back to work .
the rest of the day i had this nazi feeling in my stomach .
but i continued to work .
and at the end of the day , i grabbed my things , and i went to the hospital and went to the parking car , when i did something that i didn &apos;t do .
i went home from the emergency department to my journey .
and there was another nurse there saying , not the sister had seen the printer , but another three words to me , and those three words , most of the emergency doctors i know .
other medical doctors fear this as well , but the emergency medicine is particularly , because we &apos;re seeing the patients just like this .
the three words : do you remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patients that they put back home ? &quot;
asked the nurse .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in this particular clay .
so she was back .
she was back and die .
about an hour after you got home , after i sent them home , it collapsed , and the family called 911 . the rescue assistant brought back to the emergency station with a blood pressure of 50 , which is a dangerous shock .
they barely jump and was blue fishing .
the emergency care system did all the strands .
they gave their blood pressure pressure .
they put them on the radar machine .
i was shocked and down until the inside .
and i was living through these rolleraster , because after the stabilization , they came up and i hoped they would recover .
and after two , three days , she realized she would never wake up .
she had not suffered a brain damage .
their family gathered themselves .
and over the course of the next eight or nine days , they gave themselves a failed .
the new day , they went to see them -- woman &apos;s printer , a woman , a mother and grandmother .
you say you &apos;ve never forget the names of the people who die .
and that was the first time i knew this myself .
so the next couple of weeks i took forward , and i learned myself for the first time , the unhealthy shame that exists in our medical culture -- i felt myself , isolated , not the kind of poor shame that you feel , because you can &apos;t talk to the colleagues about it .
you all know all the healthy shame , if you give a secret of the best friend , even though this one on a slippery and you get caught and the best friend is going to come up with one of these , and you have a terrible discussion when it comes to the end , and you can never make it again again .
if you &apos;re doing fine , and never power the mistake again .
this is the kind of educational shame .
the unhealthy species that i &apos;m talking about is the ones that make one in the interior .
it &apos;s the one that tells you that it &apos;s not what you did , it &apos;s bad , you know , it &apos;s bad .
and that was what i felt .
and it wasn &apos;t on my top doctor , he was very gentle .
he talked to the family , and i &apos;m sure he was doing the glass glass , and i was sure that i wasn &apos;t going to bribe .
but i continued to ask these questions .
why didn &apos;t i ask the top doctor ? why did i go home ?
and then in my worst moments , how could i make such a dumb mistake ?
why did i go to medicine ?
but slowly , it turned out .
i started feeling better .
and then one of the day day , there was a hole in the clouds , and the sun broke out and i could feel better again .
and i was out of that , if i had doubled my efforts for perfection , and never again a mistake , that the voice could be swallowed .
and she did .
and i continued to work .
and then it happened again .
two years later , i had service in the emergency center in a residential hospital north of toronto , and i proposed a 25 year-old old man with old raws .
it was a lot left , and i got into it .
he always showed up here .
i looked in the front and it was a little bit pink .
and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him .
and yet , when he went out of the door , he showed his box .
two days later , i came to my next emergency service and my chedyine asked me to do a conversation in her office .
and she said the three words : do you remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patient with the crazy rappers ? &quot;
it turns out he was a boarding infection .
he had an potentially living living disease called eausottitis .
you can google , but it &apos;s not infection from the top , but the upper breathing lanes and causes the end of the breath .
and fortunately , he died .
he got intravena anti-boasis and made a few days later .
and i went back through the same torcet of shame and self-doubt , felt free and went to work until it again and again and again .
in an emergency layer , i have looked at two times a blind license .
there &apos;s a lot of things about it , especially if you think you &apos;re working in a hospital that &apos;s just 14 patients at this time .
in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home and there was no man in their treatment .
i thought he would have had kidney stones .
i put it on an x-ray of the kidney , when it was without finding , my colleague , at the reception of the patient , found a violation in the lower right sector and called the operanders .
the other one had strong diarrhea .
i swam on him to rehyate and asked my colleagues to evaluate him .
and that &apos;s what he did , and when he put a sword on the right in the right sector , he called the executives .
in both cases , operiined and went well .
both cases of me , ask me .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst mistake happened only in the first five years , what many of my colleagues say , but total nonsense .
some of my sound happened in the last five years .
alone , shame and without assistance .
here &apos;s the problem : if i can &apos;t close with my mistakes and talk about them , if i can tell the little voice that i &apos;m saying , what &apos;s really happening , how can i do it with my colleagues ?
how can i teach them my mistakes so that they don &apos;t do the same ?
if i was in a room -- like now , i have no idea what you &apos;re thinking about me .
when did you hear the last time from someone &apos;s misbeat about misbeat over misbreaks ?
oh yeah , you go to a cocktail party and you may hear about any other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody about your own mistakes .
if i was in a space full of colleagues and for their immediate support , and to tell them what i &apos;ve just told you , i would not be able to reach the end of the second story , before they really , really uncomfortable , and forget about the rest .
and in fact , if i knew or my colleagues , an orthopedide in my hospital would have taken off the wrong leg , you believe me , i would have problems to look into the eyes .
this is the system that we live in .
it &apos;s a totally denial of mistakes .
it &apos;s a system in which there are two basic positions -- those who make mistakes and the ones that don &apos;t do . those who are the lack of sleep and without limitation , which with bad results and good results .
it &apos;s almost an ideological response as antibodies , which will attack people .
and there is the idea that if we do those who are making mistakes out of medicine , we have a secure system .
but there are two problems .
in my about 20 years of the medical age and journalism , i &apos;ve created a personal medical study about medical errors and wrong treatments to do so much for one of my first articles , which i wrote for the toronto of my show , &quot; white rabbit , black &quot; wrote learning .
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely incomplete .
we &apos;re going to make mistakes in a system of every day , where one of 10 medials either is false or wrong , in the hospital infections and always get more sophisticated and destroyed or dead .
in this state , about 24,000 canans die in complete mistakes .
in the united states , deciphering the institute for medicine in 100,000 .
both of these are strong subintensity because we don &apos;t look at the problem as we should .
and it &apos;s the crux .
in a hospital system , the medical system is doubling all two to three years , we can &apos;t keep up .
sleep is ubiquitous .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we have a cognitive error , so we can take a perfect disease over the patient with chest pain .
and then i take the same patient with chest pain , i put it down and pass it and give it a slightly alcoholic breath and all of a sudden , the story goes through with contempt .
i don &apos;t take the same course .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i do things not always the same .
and my patients are not cars ; they &apos;re not always telling me their symptoms in the same way .
all of this is completely unavoidable .
so if you take the system like this , as i &apos;ve been taught , and all of the faultes of health care , you don &apos;t end up with any more .
and you know the power of people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
in my show &quot; white theft , black , &quot; i &apos;ve got the habit to say , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; i would say to each of the rescue to the carfarologists , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah . &quot; what about the microphone ? &quot; and then i &apos;ll show you to the microphone .
and then their puffs , they &apos;re hit before the head , they look down , and they look hard , and they start telling their stories .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
you want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t do the same mistake i made . &quot;
what you need is a environment which you &apos;re able to get in the position .
what you need is a new medical culture .
and it starts with a doctor .
the new redefining doctor is a human , knows about his humanity , she is not proud of making mistakes , but puts everything out of them , so it can be passed on .
they share their experiences with others .
they supported when others are talking about their mistakes .
and she shows others their mistakes , not to be an unable , but in a loving way that all of them will benefit .
and she &apos;s working in a medical culture that recognizes that people fill the system with life and when that is , then people do mistakes from time to time .
so that the system has evolved to create bacy , which makes it easier to find mistakes that are inevitable and also allowed loving , supporting spaces , where anyone who &apos;s watching health care , in fact , can be rewarded , in fact , like me , who should be able to make the potential and get to that reward .
my name is brian goldman .
i &apos;m the new defining doctor .
i &apos;m a person . i make mistakes .
i &apos;m going . but i &apos;m trying to learn best from it to make it further .
i don &apos;t know what you think of me , but i can live .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember myself .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
it &apos;s about transformational standards .
and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i &apos;m going to tell you three stories to use the time .
the first story is about charles darwin , one of my heroes .
you know , he was in 1835 here .
you may think it &apos;s finly , but it &apos;s not true .
actually , he collected fish .
he described one of them as a very , &quot; usually . &quot;
it was a shepherd .
until the &apos; 80s , he was caught in great style .
now he &apos;s on the red list .
we heard a lot of the history of the galapagos , or other places , it &apos;s not very special .
yet , we still come to the galapagos .
we still think they were originally .
they still describe it as untouched .
what &apos;s happening here ?
the second story is to make a different concept , the transformative taillal length .
because i studied it when i studied in 1971 a lagoin in west africa .
i went there because i grew up in europe , and i later wanted to work in africa .
i thought i could integrate myself .
and i got a terrible sunfire and i was convinced that i really wasn &apos;t there .
it was my first sunfire .
as you can see , the lamas of palmen and a couple of mangroves were swallowed .
there were bunches of about 20 millimeters , black nails , an underspecies of colorful baroils .
the fish of this buny of fish were very sophisticated , and the fishermen lived well and they were doing well in ghana .
when i returned there for 27 years , the fish went back to half its size .
they grow up five centimeters .
they were genetically charged .
it was still fish .
people were still happy .
and the fish was also lucky to be there .
so it doesn &apos;t change , and yet everything has changed .
my third little story tells me about my classship at the introduction of fisheries in southeast asia .
in the &apos; 70s -- rather at the &apos; 60s , europe has a lot of development projects .
fishing controlled countries , which started 100 fish , called the industrial fishing of this fairly ugly ship .
i was driving on it , and we went across the southern southern ocean and particularly in the javasee .
we didn &apos;t have words for what we started there .
i know now that the ocean was the ocean .
90 percent of our fangs were sponges , other animals that are connected to the reason .
the largest part of the fish , the small dots there on the rubble , the ticking , were coral reefs .
essentially , the main part of the ocean , and then was thrown back .
these images are extraordinary , because the transition is very quick .
within a year , you take a census and then starts with the commercial fish .
the reason is changing . from -- in this case , a hard reason , or soft corals will be matl crap .
this is a dead turtle .
they weren &apos;t eaten , they threw them away because they were dead .
we started a vibrant one .
she wasn &apos;t drunk yet .
then they wanted to kill them because they could well eat them .
in fact , this mountain of truf every time is collected by fisders when they drive in areas where they &apos;ve never been seen .
it won &apos;t be documented .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
we adapt our standards of the new level and we don &apos;t call ourselves a reminder of what was there .
if you generalize it , this is what happens .
on the y-axis , there are some good things : biodiversity , number of orca , the green supply , the water supply .
over time , it &apos;s changing . it changes because people are , of course , their actions .
every generation is looking at the images that you &apos;re looking at at the beginning of your conscious life , as a standard and becomes all of it .
the difference becomes a loss .
but they don &apos;t take the previous losses right .
it can give a sequence of changes .
and in the end , you just want to get the genome remains .
that &apos;s right now our goal .
we want to get things that are gone or things that are not more like them .
you could think that the problem of people , who certainly , when they lived in predators in predators , were killing animals , and they were only aware of a few generations of what they did .
because obviously an animal is going to be very common , just before it dies .
so you don &apos;t lose the animals often .
you &apos;re always losing rare animals .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not being seen as a great loss .
at the time we focus on the big animals and the sea , that &apos;s the big fish .
they are rare because we &apos;re catching them .
over time , little fish left and we think that &apos;s the contradiction .
the question is , why do people accept this ?
well , because they didn &apos;t know that it was different .
of course , many people , scientists , confirm that it was really different .
they &apos;re going to confirm it because the evidence , how they were in a previous form , are not as they would like the evidence .
so , for example , there is the anecdote that the report of an honor of the sound , that looked like this in this area , cannot be used in this place , or from fishing scientists , usually not trade , because it &apos;s not &quot; scientific . &quot;
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in educated societies because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
this shows the enormous difference that can play a marine reserve .
because by marine reserves , we basically have the past .
we put the past back the past that people can &apos;t understand because the standards have changed and very low .
so , the people who can see a marine reserve , and they can benefit from what makes it possible to restore their standards .
what about the people who aren &apos;t possible , because they don &apos;t have access to the people in the middle west ?
here , i think the art and the film may fill the gap , and the simulations .
this is the simulation of chesapeake bay .
a long time ago there were gray whales -- 500 years ago .
and the color notes , you may remember &quot; avatar . &quot;
if you think about &quot; avatar , &quot; if you think about why people were touched by this -- besides the pocahon-tale story , why were they touched by the image world ?
because it &apos;s calling something that has been lost in some way .
so my recommendation , the only one i &apos;m going to give you is cameron , so he &apos;s spinning under the avatar ii .
thank you .
in the &apos; 80s , in communist eastern germany , you had to , if you had a writing machine , that in the government .
they also had to analyze a leaf with unprecedented text from this typewriter .
the reason for this : the government could track back to where a text came from .
they had an article with folding thought , they could detect the creators of this thought .
and we couldn &apos;t understand how anybody could do something like that , and how much that would be called freedom .
in our own countries , we would never do something like that .
but if you buy a new color printer today in 2011 of the leading laser printing printer , and print a page , then this side bright yellow beat on every page , put it on a pattern that makes it clear to you and track your printer .
that &apos;s what happens today .
and no one seems to be there .
and that was an example where our own governments have the technology against us , the citizens .
and this is one of the three main sources of existing online problems today .
let &apos;s see what &apos;s really happening in the world : we can split the attacks in categories .
we have three main groups .
there &apos;s online criminals .
for example , here , this is mr. lessig gulf golupond from the ukraine .
and the motivation of online criminals are very easy to understand .
these people deserve money .
they use online attacks to make a lot of money , a huge pile of money .
there are several famous cases of online millions of times , multimillionous , who made their money through attacks .
this is wladime tsastsin from camtu in estonia .
this is alfred gonzmen .
stephen watt .
bjbeans sundin .
these are matthew anderson , tariq al-daour and so on and so on .
these people have come online to wealth , but they have liberated it by an example by using trojans to steal money from our bank bank , while we do our online banking , or also the keycollider that have collected our credit information on the keyboard as we buy over a infected computer online .
the u.s. american intelligence system , two months ago , is the swiss account of mr. sam jain here , and on this account was 14.9 million dollars when it turned out .
mr. jain himself is a free foot , which is unknown in the place .
and i &apos;m going to argue that today it &apos;s more likely that we will become victims of online , than one of the things in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this will be even worse .
in the future , most crimes will play online .
the second largest group we can see today is not motivated by money .
they &apos;re motivated by something else -- protests , one opinion , or through their audience .
groups like anonymous are up over the last 12 months and become one of the main players on the field of online attacks .
so these are the three main attacks : criminals , who are doing the money because of the money they can afford to be anonymous , but the last group are nations , but the last group are nations who lead attacks .
there are cases of what the saninotar .
it shows unprecedented what happens when governments attack their own citizens .
diginotar is a complete justice certificate from the netherlands -- or it was .
in the last fall , it had to raise insolvz , because saninotar was hacked .
somebody was broken , and it was hacked the system .
and last week in a meeting with dutch government , i hired one of the abended of this group , whether he had died for the fact that because of the saninotar , people had died .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
now , how are people dying of a hab ?
diginotar is a certificate .
they sell certificate .
what do you do with certificate ?
well , a certificate you need , if you have a website with hl encrypts , for example , for example .
now , we use all of us , or many of us , gmail or one of their competitors , but these services are very common in totalitarian states like iran , where dissidents are using , you know , that local government can use more trust than a local and that they can &apos;t snivel around the slips .
but if you &apos;re in a foreign fashion .
certificate , privatization and fake certificate .
and that &apos;s exactly what duninotar is .
how about the arab spring and the things that are happening in egypt ?
now , in egypt ploted , in april of 2011 , the main headquarters of the egyptian intelligence police , and they found a lot of records .
in these records , a folder called &quot; finfisher . &quot;
and in this folder , there was a set of notes in germany that had sold a few programs to the egyptian government , which they had -- in very large framework -- any communication of the egyptian citizens could catch .
they had sold this program for 280,000 euros to the egyptian government .
the headquarters headquarters is right here .
so western governments power totalitarian governments with aid to be able to do their own citizens .
but western governments also help themselves .
for example , in germany , just a couple of weeks ago , what &apos;s called the state of the electricity . that was a trojan , who was used by german government to address their own citizens .
if you &apos;re defined in a criminal case , it becomes pretty safety to your phone .
but today we &apos;re far beyond that .
they tap their internet connection .
they use tools like the state of state , to post their computer with a trojan , which allows them to monitor their entire communication , their online discussions , to keep their online arguments .
so if we keep thinking about things like this , then the obvious answer of people would be , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but i don &apos;t know , because i &apos;m a braver citizen .
i don &apos;t have to worry !
i don &apos;t have to hide . &quot;
and that argument doesn &apos;t make sense .
privacy has to be given .
privacy is not about debate .
it &apos;s not a choice between privacy and safety .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
and as we do today , in 2011 , our governments will trust , it &apos;s quite a good thing that we make for forever .
and we trust , we &apos;re blind to each future government , a government that we may have in 50 years ?
these are the questions we have to deal with for the next 50 years .
it may seem strange to you , but i &apos;m a big fan of concrete blocks .
the first concrete blockstones were made in 1868 , and made a simple idea : modules out of cement with solid measurements that fit together .
in fact , very quickly building blocks were very quick in the world .
they put us in the position to build things larger than we , buildings , bridges , a rock after the other .
essentially , the concrete block was the block of our time .
almost a hundred years later , lego came out of this .
it was called &quot; automatically reactive . &quot;
and within a few years , lego moved in every household .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion stones were produced -- or 75 stones for every person on this planet .
you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to create beautiful houses , beautiful bridges or beautiful buildings .
lego made it possible for everybody .
lego basically has the concrete block , the building block of the world , and made it a building block for our imagination .
in the meanwhile , in the same year , the bell labs were announced the next revolution .
the transistor was a small plastic unit that was made of a world of the static , one-on-one blocks to a world in which everything was interactive .
like the concrete block , the transistor allows us to build much more complex distances , a rock after the other .
but there &apos;s a major difference : the transistor was only for experts .
i personally accept that the building block of our time is good for experts and so i decided to change that .
eight years ago , i was at the media lab , and i started studying this idea of how to put the power of engineers in the hand of artists and designers .
a few years ago , i started to develop littginges .
let me show you how they work .
littlebits is electronic panels that have a specific function .
they &apos;re presolved , light , sound , motor and sensor .
and the best thing about it is they connect with magnets .
so you can &apos;t put them around .
the rocks are color .
green is a solution , blue is electricity , pink is wires and orange .
so everything you need to do is connect a blue and one green , and you can build a lot of bigger circular pollutants .
they add a blue to a green , and they can make light .
you can put a switch in between and you have a little dimmer .
take the switch out of a cockroach , which is here , and you &apos;ve made a little blind .
if you add this buzzer for a extra effect , and you &apos;ve made a noise machine .
i &apos;ll stop that .
beyond the simple game , littgingits is actually pretty powerful .
rather than that you have to code , or you &apos;ve got to break , you would have littable , it allows you to program simple , intuitive gestures .
so to accelerate the blind or slow it down , just turn on this button and it makes the momentum faster or slower .
the idea behind littgingits is that it &apos;s a growing library .
we want to put every single interaction on this world in a durable rock .
lights , sound , solar elements , motors -- everything should be available .
we have littgingits children , and they play with it .
and it was an incredible experience .
the most beautiful thing is , how do you start to understand the electronics that it surrounds in life and not learn in school ?
like , for example , a night light works , or why the doors are reacting to you , or how a ipod respond to touch .
we &apos;ve also brought littlebits to design schools .
so , for example , we had designers with no experience in electronic things that started playing with litt-like its material .
here we see filz , paper and water bottles , like geordie ...
so a couple of weeks ago , we &apos;ve gotten littlebits to risd and gave them some designers who had no technical experience -- just tension , wood and paper -- they said , &quot; what . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project that they did , a movable confat canary .
but wait , this is really my favorite project .
it &apos;s a hummer of play-doh , the fear in the darkness .
for this non-engineers , littlebits is another material , electronics was just another material .
and we want to make this material available for everyone .
so littgingits open is open .
you can go to the website , you can download the design of design and make it yourself .
we want to have the world of creating the inventor , the inventor , because this world that we live in , these interactive world , belongs to us .
so , pull out and start to invent .
thank you .
