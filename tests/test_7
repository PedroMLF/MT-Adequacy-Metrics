you know , one of the great fellows in travel and one of the pleasure in the race of ethnic science is to live with the people who can still remember the old days , and they &apos;re able to touch the back of the plants in the more unequal leaves of plants .
just to know that , in fact , jaguar shaman still travels beyond the milky way , or the meaning of the myths of the inuit , are still full of meaning , or that in the himalayas , the world &apos;s idea is that the world , in fact , is that the world , in the most part of the world , is the idea that the world , in the most part , is in the absolute sense , but only as a model of reality .
and of course , we all share the same adaptation .
we &apos;re all born . we get kids to the world .
we start iterating rituals .
we have to deal with the unprotected separation of death , and so it shouldn &apos;t surprise us that we all sing , dance and bring art .
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique tone of the , the rhythm of the dance in every culture .
it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s about penoon in the forests of borneo , or the voodoo akolyths in haiti , or the warrior in the manut desert of northern kenya , the cursor of the world , or a barak-shepherd in the middle of the qomolma , or a barak-shepherd in the middle of the qomolma .
all of these people teach us that there &apos;s other ways of doing other ways of thinking , other ways of guidance on earth .
and this is an idea that , when you think about it , can only fulfill hope .
together , the myriad cultures in the world make a network of spiritually and cultural life , which is the earth , and that &apos;s probably important for the earth as important as the biological grid of life you know as a biosphere .
you can imagine this cultural network of life as an ethnosphere , and race can be as the total sum of all thoughts and dreams , myths and intuitive ideas that have been created by the human imagination since the beginning of consciousness .
the ethnosphere is the great legacy of humanity .
it &apos;s the symbol of all that we are and what we &apos;re capable of as an amazing thing .
and just as the biosphere got strong , this happened with the race sphere -- except even greater speed .
there would be a biologist , for example , to say that 50 percent or more of all species are just in front of extinction , because it &apos;s simply not true , and yet , this -- the apokalypthe of the biological diversity on the biological diversity of the cultural diversity .
and the key indicator is extinction .
when any of you were born in this room , there were 6,000 languages spoken on earth .
now , a language isn &apos;t just the totality of the traits or a series of grammatically .
a language is expression of the human mind .
it &apos;s a means that the soul of a particular culture finds access to the tangible world .
every language is like a rich forest of the mind , a turning point , a thought , an ecosystem , a spiritual possibility .
and from those 66,000 languages today , while we &apos;re sitting here in monterey , the half half doesn &apos;t whisper into the ears of children .
they &apos;re not taught for small kids anymore . that means if nothing is done , they &apos;re already dead .
what might be more lonely than being the silence of being one of the last people to speak to their language , not to have a possibility to have the wisdom of the ancestors , or to expect the hope of children ?
and yet , this terrible destiny , in fact , does not drive someone on earth , about every two weeks , because every two weeks , one of the two weeks , is dying and takes the last silver language to the grave .
and i know some of you say , &quot; is it not better ? &quot; wouldn &apos;t the world be a better place when we &apos;re all talking one language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s be this language yoruba . &quot;
let &apos;s be cogi . &quot;
and then suddenly you would recognize how it would be if you couldn &apos;t speak your own language .
that &apos;s why i &apos;d like to take you today on a journey through the race sphere , a short journey through the race of race , to try to make sure what &apos;s actually lost .
now there are some of us who kind of forget that when i say , &quot; different ways of being , &quot; &quot; really different ways of being my own .
for example , take this child of the barasana in the northwest of the amazon , the people of anaconda , believe that they came up with mythologically the bush river from the east of saint snakes .
this is a people who aren &apos;t cognitively different from the colors blue and green , because the skies of heaven are dependent on the forest .
they have a similar language , and a nurse &apos;s signature called the linguistic exotic gamma : you have to marry somebody who talks a different language .
all of this tracks in the mythological past . the same thing in these big houses , because of the mischeck of six or seven languages , is that you never hear somebody who learns a language .
you just hear and start talking .
or , one of the most fascinating tribes that i &apos;ve ever lived with , which i &apos;ve ever had in the northeast of ecuador , is an amazing people who first entered in 1958 peace .
in 1957 , five missionaries were trying to contact and make a very heavy mistake .
they threw shiny photos from the air , which is what we would consider as a friendly gesture , and then they forgot that these people had never seen a two-dimensional sequence of the rainforest in their life .
they took these photographs from the forest floor , trying to see behind the face or the character , didn &apos;t find anything and understood that business cards were of the devil and killed the five missionaries .
but the waorani wasn &apos;t killing just outside with the spears .
they went through each other .
54 percent of the deaths happened through it .
we went back to the genetiaology eight generations , and we found two cases of a natural death and when we asked people to do something about it , they gave them that one of the people died that he had died because of his age , and we killed him with the spears .
but at the same time , they had a clear knowledge of forests that was amazing .
their hunter-gatherable could smell the urine of an animal from 40 yards away , and determine what animal species of this mine .
in the early 50 years , i got a really amazing job when i asked my professor at harvard , if i was interested in walking to haiti and to revive the secret societies that were the foundation of duvalier and tonton , which was used to make zombies .
in order to give this a sense of a sense , i had to believe something about this remarkable belief of vodouglas and voodoo is not a cult of black magic .
in the opposite , it &apos;s a complex metaphysical view .
it &apos;s interesting .
if i asked you to count the great world experts , what would you say ?
christianity , islam , buddhism , or whatever .
a continent will always leave out , because the guess was that there was no religious faith in sub-saharan africa , of course , and there was a voodoo and a voodoo just over this very profound religious thought that came over during the course of time .
but what makes voodoo so interesting is that living relationship between living and dead .
the living sums of minds .
the ghosts can be picked up from the very large water , answers to the rhythm of the dance to direct the soul of the living temporary , so that the acolyth for a moment becomes the god .
the voodoo likes to say the voodooists , &quot; you &apos;re going to the church and you talk about god .
we &apos;re dancing in the temple and become god . &quot;
and because you &apos;re obsessed with the mind , you get taken off of the mind . how can you get damage ?
look at these amazing demonstrations : voodoo-akolyths in a trancestate state , the burning coal without self-repair , an amazing visualization of the ability to influence the body that this is happening when he gets into a state of extreme arousal .
now , from all people i &apos;ve met , the cogi from the sierra nevada of santa marta in northern columbia , the most extraordinary .
proxy of the old tyrannious civilization , which is the mobian coastal level of columbia , and in the process , this people moved back into an isolated volcanic massive , which goes up through the sun floor .
in a blood-up continent , these people were the only ones who have never been conquered by the spaniards .
until today &apos;s day , they &apos;re governed by a ritual pristeresthood , and education is very extraordinary , but it &apos;s very extraordinary .
the young acolyens are separated at the age of three and four years from their families , and in a dark world of the finasters , in stone hats , in stone lines , for 18 years of the glacier , they would spend metals in the lap of the great mother .
and during that whole time , they are culturally introduced to the values of their society , values that maintain the claim that their prayers and their prayers , the cosmic -- or we could say that the ecological -- equilibrium .
at the end of this amazing initiation , you &apos;ll suddenly take one day out , and for the first time in your life , at age 18 years , you see a solar lining , and in this crystal moment , it &apos;s all going to be what you &apos;ve learned in the abstract , and that &apos;s the priest , and it &apos;s really , you know , what i &apos;ve been telling you .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
they call themselves the older brothers , and they say we &apos;re the younger brothers , for the destruction of the world .
now this level of intuition is going to be very important .
and whenever we think of one-born and landscape , we would either arrest them , and the old smells of the nodelious wild , which is a rasonic thought , which is a rasonic thought , or on the thoreau , and say , these people are more connected than we are .
so , millions of people aren &apos;t sentimental , they &apos;re going to be swallowed by nostalgia .
it &apos;s not a lot of space because it &apos;s going to be in the malaria aquarium of asmat , or the cold winds of tibet , but still , through time and ritual , you have a mysterious nimbus of the earth , which is not based on the idea of being , but on a far subtle intuition , the idea of the earth .
now , what does that mean ?
it means that a little kid who grows in the belief is that the mountain is an apu-mind , who will be , or her destiny , will become a completely different human being , and another relationship to this resource is going to be a whole bunch of rocks that can be stored .
whether it &apos;s an altsplace of a mind or a pile , it &apos;s irrelevant .
the interesting thing is the metaphor that defined the relationship between the individual and the nature .
i grew up in the woods of british columbia , and i believed that these forests are going to be there .
so that made me a different human being as my friends under the kwakitl , believing that these forests of the altsk have come from hukuk and the nebox , and the nenibalic ghosts , which would live in the north of the world .
now , if you start to look at the idea that these cultures can actually create different realities , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries .
it &apos;s a photograph i took last april in the northwest of the amazon .
this is ayahuasca , from which many of you have heard , the most powerful psychoalate of the pharmaman .
what ayahuasca does is not just the pharmacology potential of this prepartive , but its processing is actually made out of two different sources . it &apos;s made up of two different sources , on the one hand , which is a series of becets of the coffee on your consciousness , and it &apos;s about the leaves of the coffee to the name of the coffee .
this plant contains a lot of very strong tryptamine that the serotonin , dimethyltrypate , and in very similar ways , are very similar .
if you &apos;ve seen the yaly momi , like you saw this stuff , this substance that you make out of different kinds of ways also compute in the different ways as well .
this powder is kind of like being made out of a gun from a gun of mine , covered by baroque paintings , and the landing on a sea of electricity .
it &apos;s not going to create bias of reality , but the resolution of reality .
i even have with my professor , richard evan shultes , who was the guy who had the psychedelic with the discovery of the magic mushrooms in mexico in the 30-year years , and i told you that you could not be there to experience a hallucination .
but the thing about tryptamins is that they can &apos;t be engaged , because they &apos;re in the human gut of course with a name of &quot; monoamin-oxidasy . &quot;
you can only be engaged in relation to some other chemicals that mao denatrimore .
now , the fascinating thing is that the betapes , which are in the liwers , are mao-abilizers of exactly the kind , which is necessary to make the tryptamine . so ask yourself .
how can these people from a flora of 80,000 species can find these two morphologically plants that have these two morphologically plants , which , if they combine this way , create a kind of biochemical version , so that the whole thing is bigger than the sum of its parts ?
we use this great euphemism , trying and error , which turns out to be meaningless .
but ask the indians to say , &quot; the plant is talking to us . &quot;
so , what does that mean ?
this tribe , the cofan , have 17 varieties of ayahuasca , which you recognize at large distances in the forest for our eyes as a kind .
and then you ask them how they say their taxonomy and they say , &quot; i thought you know something about plants .
i mean , you don &apos;t even know anything ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
so , it turns out that you take every one of the 17 varieties of the entire moon and you sing to a different scale .
now , it doesn &apos;t give you a ph.d. at harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than counting fish .
well , the problem , the problem , is that even those of us who have the relevance to the difficult situation , they look as orginian and colorful looking at the past , whereas the real world is changing .
so , in fact , the fact is that you don &apos;t remember the 20th century in 300 years , in 300 years , or the technical innovation , but in fact , in a era where we were either active , and the massive destruction of biological and cultural diversity on earth is either active or passive . so the problem is not the change .
all cultures have been involved in the dance with new life possibilities .
and the problem is not the technology .
the inflax american didn &apos;t stop to be on sioux , when the arch and arrow , when the americans listened to being americans , when the americans and horse drivers .
not change and technology , the integrity of the race sphere , it &apos;s power . the ugly face of the rule .
and as you can see , in the world , you &apos;re going to discover that these cultures are not the set of the set . these are dynamic living peoples , whose existence is going to move through their quality of customization , whether it &apos;s in the middle of the world , which is the way that you can see , in the middle of the world , it &apos;s going to be , you know , in the middle of the world , in the middle of the world , and it &apos;s going to be the
or if we go to the mountains of tibet , where i see a lot of research , you will see the ugly face of the political dominance .
you know , the genocide , the physical extinction of people , is in general , but the race , the destruction of the lifestyle of people &apos;s people , will not only be convicted , but generally , as part of a developmental strategy .
and you can &apos;t understand the suffering if you haven &apos;t experienced it at the bottom level .
i traveled to a young colleagues , 650,000 miles of chtidu in west china , across southeast tibet , and only when i came to lhasa , and i came up with the face of the statistics that were being murdered by the statistics of the trees that were being murdered by the cames revolution .
the father of this young man was identified as a followers of the pandemic .
that meant that he was instantly killed during the chinese invasion .
his uncle wah with her holiness in the diaspora , who brought people to nepal .
his mother became locked , as punishment for the crime .
he was rejected at the age of two years in prison to hide under her rocknballs , because she couldn &apos;t live without it .
the sister who did this paper was brought into a educational camp .
and one day she came up with a handband maos , and she had to go for this exaggeration for seven years into a heavy labor camp .
the suffering can be limitless , but the spirit of people &apos;s minds is something unforforable .
and at the end , we &apos;re really facing a choice . do we want to live in a monochromatic world of monotonia or in a polychromatic world ?
margaret mead , the great anthropologist said before she died that her greatest fear is that while we &apos;re moving towards a thread , we &apos;re not just going to look at the entire bandwidth of human imagination , we would not just look at all the entire possibilities of human imagination , but that we would have one day out of a dream .
and it &apos;s humble to think that our species may have existed for 600,000 years .
the neolithic revolution , which brought us agriculture , and at that moment of the culdiction of the seed , the poetry of the nman sat through the prosa of the priesthood and hierarchy , specialization and surplus -- found only 10,000 years ago .
the modern industrial world as we know it is hardly 300 years old .
now , this superficial story doesn &apos;t tell me that we have all the answers to the challenges that we are in the next millennia .
if we ask these similarities world cultures to the meaning of human being , they respond to 10,000 different voices .
and in this song , we &apos;ll be able to discover the possibility that we are , what we are : people with full awareness that are aware of the importance that all humans and gardens will flourish to be a room , and there &apos;s great moments of optimism .
here &apos;s a photograph i took in the northern end of the baffan islands , when i went to scumation hunt , and this man , olula , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
the canadian government is not always very good with the inuit , and during the ninth years of our ancestors , they were forced to pull in settlements .
the grandfather was terrified of this old man .
the family , the fear of his life , took him all the weapons and all the tools .
now you have to know that the inuit doesn &apos;t have fear of the cold . they used them to their advantage .
the rail tracks were originally made of fish , which was wrapped into carbu-skin .
the man &apos;s grandfather was not afraid of the arctic night or the rub storm .
he hatch out to the outside , leaving his pants out of masishide and debuved in his hand , and as the feces began to fried , he formed her in the form of a piece .
he flourished to the pages of the popopopopoer , and when it was frozen , he was a dog .
he reclaimed the dog and improvised a sjeck , took the skeleton of the dog and improvised a simple , spanish , a different dog on the side of the belt .
you can &apos;t do anything like that .
and this is in many ways a symbol for the resistance of the inuit and all the child .
the canadian government gave the inuit in april in 1999 , 1999 full control over a area that is bigger than california and texas .
it &apos;s our new country and means now avsty .
it &apos;s an independent area . they control all the assets .
an amazing example of how a nation , a state that can look for its citizens and can reach .
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who are traveled to these distant goals of the earth , realizing that they &apos;re not away at all .
they are the countries of somebody .
they represent parts of the human imagination that goes back in past times , and for all of us , the dreams of these children , the dreams of our own children , are part of the geography of hope .
what we &apos;re trying to do at national geographic is that we think politicians never achieve something .
we believe that polemites -- we believe that polemics is not convinced , but we believe that storytelling can change the world and we &apos;re probably the best institution in the world , and our website is probably the best institution in the world .
156 nations sent our tv channel .
our magazines are being read by millions .
and we &apos;re going to take a series of trips to the race sphere that we &apos;re going to take our audiences to places from such cultural wonders , that they would take off from the rest of the world , and hopefully , you &apos;ll be able to adopt the central revelation of anthropology in the world that the wisdom of all people can contribute to our own well-being .
thank you .
what i &apos;m going to do first , as quickly as possible , is going to show the fundamental work , a new technology that we do microsoft as a part of a year ago , and it &apos;s an environment where you can either deal with a huge amount of visual data .
we see a lot of , many gigabytes of digital photographs here , which you &apos;re going to get in the seamlessly and it &apos;s constantly rearranged in any way .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how many information we &apos;re looking at , how big these collections are or how big the images are .
most of you are digital photographs of a camera , but this one is a scan of the library of congress and it &apos;s in a range of 300 megapixles .
it doesn &apos;t matter , because the only thing that the performance of a system like this can be restrictive is the number of pixels on your screen in every moment . it also has a very flexible architecture .
this is a whole book , an example of non-data .
this is bcking house from dickens . every spy is a chapter .
to prove that it &apos;s really about a text and not a picture , we can do something like that to really show that this is a real representation of the segment and not a picture .
maybe this is an artificial way to read a book .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
this is a realistic case . this is a copy of the guardian .
every big picture is the beginning of a section .
and that really gives you the pleasure and the good experience to read a piece of paper a magazine or a newspaper , which is a kind of a medium with multiple scales .
we did something about the the guardian of this particular copy of the guardian .
we designed a wrong ad with very high resolution , which is much higher than a normal display , and we added additional content .
if you want to see the functions of this car , you can see them here .
or other models , or even technical specications .
and this really reaches these ideas , these restrictions for the available place on the screen .
we hope that it doesn &apos;t mean any pop-ups and other nonsense -- that should not be necessary .
of course , the mapping is one of the really obvious applications for a technology like this .
and i really don &apos;t want to spend a lot of time here to say that we &apos;re going to contribute to this area .
but these are all the streets in the united states .
we have overcovered on the top of nasa .
let &apos;s get something different now .
this is actually live in the internet . you can check it out .
this is a project called photosynth , which actually connects two different technologies together .
one of them is seadragon and the other is a very good research on computer vision , which is a college student of the university of the university of the university of steve seitz .
and rick szeliski was done by microsoft , a very good collaboration .
so this is live in the internet . it &apos;s driven by seadragon .
you can see that if we can do these kinds of views where we can penetrate through images and make this experience of multiresolution .
but the spatial orientation of the images is actually in fact .
the computer &apos;s computer algorithms have signed up these images with the real space , where these images , which are all in the world , in the canadian rock , were made in the canadian rock of the world , and you can see these kinds of things that have been applied to each other .
i don &apos;t know exactly if i have time to show you other environments .
there are the ones that are much more spatial .
i would like to go straight to one of the original data sets of noah , and that &apos;s from a early prototype of photosynth that we first worked on in summer to show you what i think is really the punchline of the technology that &apos;s in the website that we have on the website .
we had to worry about lawyers and so on .
this is a reconstruction of the cathedral dame , which has only been played in the computer with pictures of flickr , just give you an emergency lady in flickr , and they &apos;re going to get pictures of men in t-shirts and on the university site and on the college site and so on . every one of these ortes is a picture that was discovered as this model .
so these are all juggling images , and they all stand up in the relationship with each other .
and we can navigate this very simple way .
you know , i never thought i &apos;ll ultimately work at microsoft .
i &apos;m very grateful for the reception here .
i guess you can see that this is a lot of different types of cameras : it &apos;s all about the handy-camera to professional slrs , a pretty large number of them being locked up in this environment .
and if possible , i &apos;ll find some of the strange ones .
many of you are covered by faces and so on .
somewhere here is a series of photographs -- here they are .
this is actually a poster of emergency dame , which was recorded right .
we can move from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
the point here is that we can do things with social environment . it &apos;s all collected data from all of the collective memories of how , like visual , the earth looks -- and everything will be connected .
all these photos are being connected , and it creates something larger than the sum of parts .
they get a model that comes from all the earth .
consider this as the sequel of stephen lawler at virtual earth .
and this is something that is caused by the complexity that people use it , growing and using the user &apos;s application with the application of the user .
their own photos will be filled with metadata , which has a different person .
if somebody has done some of the time , and all of that sacred complaint has been replaced and split who they all are , my photograph of the furre cathedral suddenly comes up with all these data , and i can use it as a starting point to come up with this kind of metascale , the photos of other people , and we can use it in this kind of metaaxis , the photos of other people .
and of course , the product of all of these are the great virtual models of any interesting part of the earth that didn &apos;t just get through the bridge or satellite images and so on , but through collective memory .
thank you .
i &apos;m going to understand you right ? your software is allowing you to do a certain moment in the next few years , all the images that are being used by somebody in the world basically ?
yes . it doesn &apos;t do anything else .
if you want to create them hyperlinks between the images .
and she &apos;s doing this because of the content in the images .
and that &apos;s really exciting when you think about the amount of semantic information that many of these images have .
as if you take a web search for pictures where you put sentences and the text of the website contains a lot of information about what the picture is .
but what if the picture is connected to all your images ?
and then the scope of the semantic cross , and the abundance that make it happen is really enormous . it &apos;s a classic grid effect .
blaise , that &apos;s really incredible . congratulations .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m going to tell you some things from my book , which , i hope , are in equilibrium with other things that you &apos;ve already heard , and i &apos;m going to try to create some connections , if you haven &apos;t noticed these .
i want to start with what i call &quot; official dogma . &quot;
the official dogma of what ?
the official faith sentence of all western industrialized societies .
the official dogma works this way : when our goal is to maximize the collective well-being of our citizens , this is all about the most primitive of freedom of the individual .
the reason is that freedom is good in itself , valuable , meaningful , meaningful premise for the human .
when people have freedom , each of us for themselves is to do the things that our most common and no one has to do for us .
the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice .
the more choices people have , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , the more common they have .
this is , i think , so deep in our water supply that it would not make sense of it .
and it &apos;s also deep in our lives .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what gives us modern progress .
this is my supermarket . no big .
i just want to briefly say something about salatdvism .
there are 175 dresings in my supermarket , if you don &apos;t count the 10 extra olivles , and you can buy 12 balseed protestry that you could buy to make a large number of your own pockets that no one &apos;s in the store for you .
so that &apos;s how the supermarket is .
and then you go to the consumer electronics in order to bring together a stereo -- speakers , cd player , a cas-player player , radio , stronger . and in this an electronics , there are so many hunters .
we can put 750 million different hunters together from the components that are offered in this store .
you have to admit that this is a great choice .
in other areas -- the world of communication .
there was a time when i was a boy , you could have a telephone that you wanted to do , as long as ma bell came .
you rented your phone . you didn &apos;t buy it . freeman .
a consequence of that was that the telephone never broke .
these days are over .
we have almost an infinite selection of phones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
my favorite is the middle of the middle -- tri3-playerars , rhino hammers and crème brchill .
and you should not have seen this before in your business , you can be sure that you &apos;ll soon be it .
and what it does is it makes people walk into the business and ask that question .
now , you know what the answer to this question is ?
the answer is no . &quot;
it &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
in other aspects of life that are very much more significant than buying counterobjects , the same explosion of choice .
it &apos;s no longer the case of health -- it &apos;s no longer the case in the united states that you go to the doctor and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , you go to the doctor and the doctor says , we could do a , or we could make b .
a has these benefits and risks .
b has these benefits and risks . what do they want to do ?
and they say , &quot; doctor , what do i do ? &quot;
the doctor says a has these benefits and risks and b has the benefits and risks .
what do you want to do ?
and if you say , &quot; if you were , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not you . &quot;
the result is -- we call it &quot; patient autonomy . &quot; that sounds like a good thing , but in reality , it &apos;s a shift of choice for choice of choice of choice of choice of choice of someone who knows -- namets of the patient -- namings of the patient -- namling of the patient .
there &apos;s an enormous marketing for the prescription drugs for people like you and me , which , if you think about it , doesn &apos;t make any sense , because we don &apos;t buy it .
why do they advertise us when we can &apos;t buy ?
the answer is : you expect to call the doctor the next morning and ask for a change of the prescription .
so something as profound as our identity is now a question of choice , how this slide is supposed to show .
we don &apos;t recognize identity ; we invent them .
and we &apos;re reinventing ourselves as often as we want .
that means that every day when you wake up in the morning , you decide what kind of person you want to be .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time where the standard assumption was that almost everybody had one and they were so fast as they could , and then fast children as they could .
the only true choice was , &quot; who , not when , and not what they did afterwards .
now everything is easy to have .
i teach wonderful intelligent students , and i &apos;ll give you 20 percent less work than i did .
and not because they &apos;re less smart , and not because they &apos;re less careful .
it &apos;s because they &apos;re busy with other things , they ask themselves , &quot; should i marry or not ? should i marry ?
should i get married ? should i have children , or should i have a career ? &quot;
these are all objective questions .
and they &apos;re going to answer these questions about whether that means to make all the tasks that i &apos;m telling you , and not a good note in my class .
and in fact , they should do that . these are important questions to answer .
work -- we &apos;re blessed , as carl demonstrates , with technology that allows us every minute of every single day to work on the planet -- to the marginoly hotel .
and by the way , there &apos;s a corner that i &apos;m not going to tell you about , which is going to work on the seeds .
i &apos;m not going to tell you , because i want to use it .
so what it means is this incredible freedom of choice in terms of working on work , again and again and again , whether we should work or not work .
we can play our kids at soccer , and we have our mobile phone on a hip , and our blackberry on others , and our laptop is probably on our lap .
and even if you &apos;re all off , every minute we &apos;re going to look at our child , we &apos;re going to look at a football game , we &apos;re also looking at a football game .
should i respond to this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
and even though the answer to the question of &quot; no , &quot; it &apos;s certainly going to be the experience of the football of your child &apos;s problem very differently .
wherever we look , big things and small things , tangible things and lifestyle , life is a question of choice .
and the world that we lived in was like this .
so i want to say there are some choices , but not everything was a question of choice .
and the world in which we live now .
and the question is , are the good news or bad news ?
the answer is &quot; yes . &quot;
we all know what &apos;s good about it , so i &apos;m going to do something about it .
all these choices have two effects , two negative effects on people .
one of the things , paradoxer , is that it &apos;s kind of blowing up .
with so many options you can choose , it &apos;s very hard to decide at all .
i &apos;m going to give you another dramatic example of this , a study about investing in volunteers at volunteers age .
a colleague of mine had access to investment records for investment records , the giant commentary society of about a million employees and about 2,000 different jobs .
and what she found was a 10 investment fund that the employer offered , took over two percent .
they offer 50 investment funding -- 10 percent less employees than if they only offer five . why ?
because it &apos;s 50 investment funding , which is so hard to decide , it &apos;s so hard to decide that they pick it up tomorrow .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow never comes .
understand that it &apos;s not just meant that people need to eat free food if they &apos;re in the aftertrack , because they don &apos;t have enough money to make it , it means decisions that make decisions so hard that they give up great investment .
they &apos;re not involved in taking up to 5,000 u.s. dollars a year on the workplace , who would have been happy to reproduce their contributions .
paralysis is a consequence of many choices .
and i think it makes the world look like this .
you want to make the decision really right when it &apos;s for all of you , right ?
they don &apos;t want to choose the wrong investment fund , or the wrong salatable .
so this is a effect . the other effect is that even when we overcome the paralysis and make a decision , we end less happy with the outcome of choice than if we had the possibility of less possibilities .
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them , if it was a good choice , is due to the great selection of salt , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and , you know , that &apos;s perfect -- it &apos;s easy to imagine that they could have made a different decision , and what &apos;s happened is that they have made a choice of regret that they had made of choice , and what &apos;s happened is that they had a decision to make the decision .
the more possibilities there are , the easier it is at all to regret that is disappointing to choice they meet .
secondly , what economists call opperori cost .
dan gilbert made a big point today by saying how much the way we evaluate things depends on what we compare .
well , if there &apos;s a lot of alternative to think about it , it &apos;s easy to imagine the attractive properties of alternative that they excluded , that makes it less comfortable with the alternatives they chose .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not new york , i apologize .
but here &apos;s what you should have thought .
here &apos;s a couple of the hamptons .
very expensive core .
beautiful beach . great day . you have it all for yourself .
what could be better ? &quot; damn &quot; the man thinks , &quot; it &apos;s august .
everyone in my manhattan neighborhood is gone .
i could park directly in front of my house . &quot;
and he reads two weeks from the thought he missed the possibility of having a great parking room .
opperori costs cost happiness that we get through our selection , even if what we &apos;ve chosen is fantastic .
and the more possibilities there are to choice , the more attractive traits of these choices will be considered in the oppercharts cost .
here &apos;s another example .
well , this cartoon does some statements .
it makes a statement now about living and perhaps doing things about it .
but a more important point he does is , whoever you decide for one thing , you don &apos;t choose to do other things .
and these other things like many attractive traits , and it will do what they &apos;re going to do less .
third , eskalination of expectations .
this struck me when i wanted to exchange my jeans .
i wear jeans , almost all the time .
and there was a time in which there was only jeans of a kind , and they bought them , and they &apos;ve been bad , they were incredibly unemsive , and when they had gotten it long enough , they started to feel &quot; ok . &quot;
so to buy new jeans after many years of the gene , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have a few jeans , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
and the salesman said , &quot; do you want to stand up , easily or do it ?
do you want buttons or distraction ? stone or acid ?
do you want jeans with holes ?
if you cut down far , you &apos;d cut it down , wet , blah , blah , blah , and so on .
my jaw was down , and after i told myself , &quot; i would have liked the way the only way to do it . &quot;
he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour trying to get all of these damn jeans , and i would leave the business -- and i &apos;ll say the truth -- with the best pasxi .
i had better it . all these choices gave it to me better .
but i felt worse .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try to explain it to myself .
the reason that i felt worse was with all these available possibilities , my expectations for what is a good couple of jeans , went up .
i had very low expectations . i had no concrete expectations than it was just in a way .
when they got into 100 species , it &apos;s got to be a perfect one .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so i compared what i would have expected to do , and what i was expected to do was look at what i expected .
the adding of possibilities in the lives of human beings is inevitably increasing the expectations of people who are going to be good about it .
and this leads to less happiness with the results , even though the results are good .
no one in the world of marketing knows this , because if you would , you don &apos;t know what it is here .
the truth is more like this .
the reason it was better than anything was better than anything was worse than anything worse , it was possible for people to do a pleasant surprise .
today in the world where we live -- we wealthy , industrialized citizens , with perfection as an expectation -- the best you can hope to do is things as good as you would expect .
they will never be surprised , because their expectations , my expectations , are high .
the secret to happiness -- that &apos;s what they all came from -- the secret to happiness are low expectations .
i want to say -- a short autobiographical moment -- that i &apos;m married with a woman , and she &apos;s really wonderful .
i couldn &apos;t have done it better . i failed .
but rainfall is not always a bad thing .
finally , a consequence of a department of buying jeans , if there &apos;s just one kind of buying , that if you &apos;re unsatisfied , and you wonder why , who is responsible , the answer is , what could you do ? what could you do ?
when hundreds of different kinds of jeans are available , and they buy the disappointing , and they ask why , who is responsible ?
it &apos;s obvious that the answer to the question is : you .
they could have done it better .
with 100 different kinds of jeans in the window , there &apos;s no excuse for mistakes .
and so , if people are making decisions , and even if the results of decisions are good , they feel disappointed about themselves .
clinical depression exploged in the industrial world over the last generation .
i think a significant -- not the only one , but a significant mixture of this explosion of depression , and also suicide , is that people have experienced the disappointing because their standards have to be so high , and then , if they have to explain these experiences , they think it would be their fault .
and so the result of this is that it &apos;s going to make us better , more objective , and we feel worse .
so let me remind you .
this is the official dogma that we &apos;re all holding for all right , completely wrong . it &apos;s not true .
there &apos;s no question , which is a little better than not , but it doesn &apos;t follow more choices than something .
there &apos;s a magical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we missed this point for a long time to make our public better .
now , as a rule question -- i &apos;m almost finished -- as a question , which is about thinking about what all these choices allow in the developed world , is wealth .
there are lots of places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard about many of them , which is not a big one .
your problem is that you have too little .
so the things i &apos;m talking about is a strange problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what &apos;s so frustrating and annoying is , steve levitt tells you about how these expensive and hard to install the car seats . it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy to help .
they actually hurt .
they &apos;re going to be worse for that .
if something of the which enables people to make our society make a difference in the societies in which people have moved too little choices to the societies in which people have moved to choice , wouldn &apos;t just improve the lives of people , but our dignity will be improved .
economists call this a pareto improvement .
income distribution is going to be that it &apos;s all better -- not just the poor -- because all of these big choices are unattached to us .
finally , reading that cartoon , and , you know , a high-developed person says , &quot; ah ! what does this fish know ?
you don &apos;t know anything in this gold fish . &quot;
prosecuged imagination , a short view of the world -- and that it &apos;s the way i read it first .
but the more i thought about it , the more i came to mind , the fish .
because the truth is that if you break the gold glass , it &apos;s all possible , you don &apos;t have freedom . you have paralysis .
if you break the gold glass glass , so that everything is possible , reduce happiness .
they increase the paralysis and lower happiness .
everyone needs a gold fish .
this is almost too limited to limited security -- possibly for the fish , definitely for us .
but the abhanden of a metaphorical fish jar is a recipe for misery , and , i guess , disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects before , about the human genome and what that means , and the discovery of new groups of genes .
in fact , we start from a new point : we &apos;ve digitized biology and now we &apos;re trying to get from the digital code into a new phase of biology by designing new lives and build .
we &apos;ve always tried to ask significant questions .
what is life ? it &apos;s something that i think many biologists have tried to understand and that on different levels .
we &apos;ve tried to simplify different approaches to the minimal components .
we &apos;ve digitized almost 20 years . when we sequenced the human genome , the change from the analog world of biology to the digital world of the computer .
now we try to wonder whether we can regenerate or can we create new life , from this digital universe ?
this is the map of a small organism , mycoplasma violin taliban , who has the smallest genome of a species that can replicate itself in the lab , and we &apos;ve tried to do that with a smaller genome .
we &apos;ve done it in about a hundred genes from the 500 or something that are here .
but if we look at these metabolic map that is very simple , in comparison to our own , trust me , that &apos;s simple . but if we look at all of these genes we can eliminate one cell , it would lead to a living cell .
so we decided that the only way to go forward is this chromosome in a very synthetic way that allows us to vary the individual components and ask some of these fundamental questions .
and so we started with question , can we be a chromosome synthetic ?
does it allow the chemistry to make these really large molecules that have never been done before ?
and , if we can do that , can we launch the chromosome ?
a chromosome is just a piece of inefficient material .
our steps in the reviving of life were exponentially .
our ability to write genetic code has been evolving very slowly , but still , and our final point is going to put on an exponential curve now .
we started it 15 years ago .
it actually took a few years to start with a bioethical review before we did the first experiments .
as it turns out , dna results are very difficult .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world making small pieces of dna , 30 to 50 letters , but it &apos;s a degeneric process , so the longer you make a piece , the more mistakes happen .
so we had to develop a new method that we could build these little bits and fix the mistakes .
this was our first attempt to start with the digital information , the genome phi x 174 .
it &apos;s a little virus of bacteria killing .
we made small pieces , made a error error and had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
the exciting phase came when we took this piece of chemical and gave it into a bacterium , and the bacteria started reading the genetic code and made viral particles .
the viral particles were released by the cells , and they came back and killed apartheid .
i talked to the oil industry recently , and they said that they were doing this model right .
they laughed more than they did here .
so we think that this is a situation in which software can actually build its hardware in a biological system .
but we wanted to go even further . we wanted to build an entire chromosome , it has more than 580,000 letters genetic code , so we thought we were building it in casks of the size of a living cell .
design is the key , and if you want to start with digital information in the computer , this digital information is really misfree .
when we first sequenced the genome in 1995 , the error rate was a mistake of a thousand base pairs .
we found out reswells , 30 errors , if we would have used the original sequence , it would never have been possible .
part of the design is to make pieces that are 50 letters long and in other 50-letters , in order to build smaller existing units to build smaller existing units these together .
we &apos;ve built unique elements here .
you may have heard that we &apos;ve built watermarks .
think about it : we have a four-letter code : a , c , g and t .
triplets of this letter -- these letters encode about 20 amino acids ; and there &apos;s a single purpose of each of these amino acids .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , sentences , thoughts .
we just signed up .
some people were disappointed that it was not poetry .
we &apos;ve engineered the pieces that we could easily dissect them with enzymes . there are enzymes that repair these and remediate them .
and we started to make pieces , start with pieces , the fifth - seven to seventh letters , to make these related to 24,000-letter pieces , to bring these together to 72,000 .
in every single step , we &apos;ve produced these pieces in overshot so that we could sequence them , because we tried to create a very robust process in a minute .
we &apos;ve tried to get to the point of automation .
so , this looks like a basketball nostalyoff .
if we get to these really big pieces -- with over 100,000 base pairs -- they &apos;re not just going to grow in e. coli . it &apos;s all the possibilities of modern molecular biology and so on .
we knew about a mechanism of homologist recombination that uses biology to repair dna that can bring together pieces like that .
here &apos;s an example . there &apos;s a organism called deinococcus radiodurans at the three million rads of radiation .
you see in the upper field that its chromosome just falls apart .
12 to 24 hours later , everything has changed like it was .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
these organisms can be totally wiped out , they can even live in a vacuum .
i &apos;m absolutely sure life exists in space and can move , looking for aquatic conditions .
in fact , nasa has shown that there &apos;s a lot of it out there .
here &apos;s a shot of the molecule that we &apos;ve created by using these processes -- actually , we &apos;ve used hefe-well mechanisms with the right design of the pieces of the design we put them automatically .
this is not a electron microscope , it &apos;s a regular microscopic graph .
it &apos;s such a big molecule that we can actually see it with the light microscope .
these are footage over a six seconds .
this is the publication that we did recently .
these are over 580,000 letters of genetic code , and it &apos;s the greatest molecule with defined structure that has ever been created by people .
it has a molecular weight of over 300 million .
if we were to print it with a writer size of 10 and without dissections , it would enlist 142 pages just to print this genetic code .
now how do we start a chromosome ? how do we activate it ?
obviously , it &apos;s very simple with a virus . it &apos;s much more complicated with bacteria .
it &apos;s also simpler if you &apos;re in eukaryonites like we are , you just take the nucleus out , and there &apos;s another inside , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;ve all heard about cloning .
archaebacteria is the chromosome embedded in the cell , but recently we showed that you can do a full transplant of a shoe from a cell to another , and that activation can be done .
we cleaned up the chromosome of a micro-species , which is , in particular , these two , as far as humans and mice , we gave some extra genes to try and select this chromosome , and it was very amazing when we put it in a cell -- and it was very amazing when we put it in a -- and it was very , very smooth .
the chromosome went into the cell .
in fact , we thought this is the end , but we &apos;ve tried to get the process a little further .
this is the main mechanism of evolution .
we find all kinds of species here that have taken a second chromosome or a third of any of each other , every time thousands of characteristics in a single second .
so people who think evolution will be changed as a gene at a time .
there are enzymes called the restriction of the restriction that actually digest dna .
the chromosome that was in the cell has not had any ; the chromosomes we &apos;ve added .
it became exprited in the cell , and it recognized the other chromosome as foreign comfort , and so we ended up with a cell with a new chromosome .
it turns out to be blue because of the genes that we &apos;ve added .
and after a very short time , it had lost all the characteristics of species , and it was completely based on a new species based on new software that we &apos;ve given in the cell .
all the proteins changed membranes -- when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we &apos;ve been restoring .
it may sound like genomic alchimia , but we can , by moving the software dna , things quite dramatically change .
now i argued that this is not the liger -- that &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years of evolution .
and i have determined that we may be able to create a new form of the camel explosion in which it could be massive new species of species based on the digital design .
why should we do that ?
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
we are about six and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
to put it in my context , i was born in 1946 .
today , three people on this planet have already existed in 1946 ; within 40 years , it will be four .
we have problems with food , fresh and clean water , medicine , fuel for 6.5 billion people .
it &apos;s going to offer a challenge for nine .
we need over five billion tons of coal , 30-plus 100 barrels of oil . that &apos;s a hundred million barrels per day .
if we think about biological processes or any process to replace that , it becomes a huge challenge .
then , of course , there &apos;s the whole co2 of this material floating in the atmosphere .
we have now , from our discoveries around the world , a database with about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the design components of the future .
the electric industry had a dozen components and you see the diversity that came out of it .
we &apos;re going to move to the limits of biological reality and to those of our ideas .
we have technologies today because of this fast ampueway to do what we call combinal genetics .
we now have the opportunity to build a large robot of the millions of chromosomes a day .
if you &apos;re going to make these 20 million different genes , or to optimize these processes to create germ , or to create new vaccines , we can change with a little team of more molecular biology than the last 20 years .
and it &apos;s just selection . we can select for life capacity , production of chemicals or fuel production , and so on .
this is a shot of effective design software that we &apos;re actually working with , where we &apos;re actually designing and design new species on the computer .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know how it &apos;s going to look . we know exactly what their genetic code is going to look like .
we &apos;re now focusing on the fourth generation .
they &apos;ve been seeing corn ethanol recently , which is a bad experiment .
we have escalators of the two-generation and third generation that are going to have a much higher market in terms of the same market , like octopus or different kinds of butans .
but , as we think , the only way that biology is going to have a huge impact without more increases is the cost of food or limitation of their availability , when we see co2 as a countermaterial , and therefore we &apos;re working on cells that are going to go away .
and we think we &apos;re going to be the first generation of the fourth generation , and that &apos;s about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
but in our discovery of the world , we all have different methods .
this is a organism we described in 1996 .
he lives in the deep sea , about a one-and-a-half miles deep , at almost cooking water temperatures .
it &apos;s turning co2 into methane around the use of hydrogen as a source .
we &apos;re looking at whether we can use co2 co2 , which could just be brought into production , forming co2 into fuel to drive this process .
within a short period of time we believe we could be able to solve one of the fundamental questions of life .
you know , we really -- moderate goals like the total of the entire petrochemical industry . right . if you can &apos;t do that at ted , where else is energy ?
but likewise , we &apos;re working on that right now , using the same approaches to the development of vaccine .
you saw this this year with flu , we &apos;re always a year back in the back and you have a dollar too little if it &apos;s about the right vaccine .
i think that can be changed by making recombinable vaccines in the pre-markets .
this is what the future might look like , with changes , can now accelerate the evolutionary tree with synthetic bacteria , archaen , and perhaps eukaryonites .
we are more of a light of people to improve . our goal is that we have a chance to survive a long enough chance to survive that perhaps . thank you very much .
on the last ted conference , i gave a introduction to the lhc .
and i promised to come back to tell you how the machine works .
so it &apos;s so far . and for all those who weren &apos;t there at the time , the lhc is the biggest scientific experiment ever in the diameter -- 27 miles in diameter .
his job is to create the conditions that exist less than a billionth second after the universe -- and to 600 million times within a second .
it &apos;s just breathtaking .
this is the machine underneath geneva .
we take images of this mini big bang all in detectors .
i &apos;m working on this . it &apos;s called atlas detector -- 44 meters in the diameter , 22 feet in diameter .
here &apos;s a spectacular picture of atlas in the construction that you see the scale .
on september 10th last year , the machine went to the first time .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
it creates immense juats in the control room .
it &apos;s a picture of the first sictance which the entire distance took back to the lhc , then inspired with a part of the lhc , to make a rain of particles on the detector .
in other words , when we saw this picture on september 10th , we knew that the machine works , what a great triumph is .
i don &apos;t know if this was created the biggest jumms , or this , as someone went to the google page and the starting side of it .
it means we have a cultural impact next to the scientific hit .
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine to do with these wires -- these golden wires here .
these wires lead 13-thousand ampmore if the machine is running up .
now , the engineers under them are going to look at them and say , &quot; no , they don &apos;t do that . they &apos;re little wires . &quot;
you can do that because if you get a lot of cool , you &apos;re going to call it superconductors .
so at minus 271 , older than the space between the stars , you can get these wires .
in one of the connections , between a thousand thousand magnets in the lhc , there was a manual .
this is how they heat down the wires , and a 13-thousand ampmore , suddenly , electric resistance .
this was the result .
now , this is even more impressive when you imagine that the magnets weigh over 20 tons and moving around about 30 inches .
so we damaged about 50 of the magnets .
and they had to remove what we did .
we used it to rerepair them .
they &apos;re all back on their way back .
the lhc will be re-functional again .
we &apos;re going to turn it up , and i would like to collect first data in june or july , and we can sit on our journey to figure out what the building blocks of the universe are .
well , of course , a kind of accidents again , again , the debate about the value of science and engineering on these boundaries . it &apos;s easy to reject .
i think the fact that it &apos;s so hard that we reach beyond our limitations , the value of things like the lhc .
i &apos;m going to leave you with the first words that we &apos;re going to leave out of a english scientist , humphrey davy , who i suspect , when he defended the use of the educational experiments of his teacher , his teaching was michael faraday , who said , &quot; nothing is so dangerous to the evolution of the human mind as we assume that our scientific ideas are all about the evolution of the human . &quot;
thank you .
i &apos;m a writer .
writing books is my job , but it &apos;s of course more than that .
it &apos;s also my big , life-long love and fascination .
and i don &apos;t expect that to change .
however , there &apos;s a little bit more weird in my life , and my career has happened to me , which made me think about this work completely .
this particular event was that i was writing a book recently -- a biography called haply , timly , love , love -- decided that , decided to come out of all my previous books in the world , and a big mega-event , which was in the world .
the result is that no matter where i come from , i &apos;m going to be treated as if i was the set .
seriously -- the backset of it !
for example , do you worry about me , and say , &quot; don &apos;t you fear that you &apos;re never going to be overwhelmed with this success ?
do you have no fear of writing your whole life , and never again create a book that &apos;s interested in anyone in the world ?
okay , that &apos;s really power .
however , it would be worse if i didn &apos;t remember that i was about 20 years ago when i first told them that i wanted to be a writer with the same kind of anxiety response .
people said , &quot; you know , are you not afraid to have success ?
do you have no fear that the humiliation of a dissection ?
do you have no fear that you take your life out of your life and never get anything out of it , and you &apos;re going to die on a blade of dreams -- your mouth filled with the bitter shell of failure ?
so , you know , you know .
the answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is : fracking .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
and i always had .
and i have a lot more things that nobody would discover .
like algae , and other terrible things .
but , when it comes to write about writing , i &apos;ve been thinking about it and question , why ?
is that sensible ?
is it logical that someone should be expected to do the work he feels ?
and what &apos;s wrong with the creative factors that they make us feel uncomfortable about the gravitational humanities -- in a way that other professions don &apos;t do ?
my father , for example , was chemist , and i can &apos;t remember the situation in his 40 years as a chemist he was asked if he was afraid to be chemist .
with your crop block , john -- how do you do it ?
it just didn &apos;t come , you know ?
but to be fair -- the group of the chemisters don &apos;t get the call of alcoholic clusters of alcohol .
we really seem to have these kinds of calls , but not only the writers , but the creative of all genres seem to have this reputation , mentally unstable .
everything you need to do is to look at the bitter death numbers of really great minds alone , which are young and often died of their own hand .
and even those who don &apos;t actually get suitioned of interest seemed to be really neglected by their talents .
norman mabessaid a little bit about his death in his previous interview , which has killed me a little more . and so , you know , norman matend killed me .
an extraordinary statement that you can do about your life .
but we don &apos;t even know if we &apos;re going to hear somebody like this , because we &apos;ve been familiar with this type of statements for this long time . somehow we have the notion that creativity and suffering , of course , that creativity and suffering -- always leads to the sea .
the question i want to ask everyone here is : is this idea for you all right ?
do you feel about it ? because with just one centimeter apart -- i feel like i &apos;m not comfortable with this notion .
i find them off .
and i find them dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to watch how they &apos;re taken into the next century .
i think it &apos;s better if we encourage our big creativity to live .
and i definitely know that it &apos;s for me -- in my situation -- very dangerous to start this dark path of guess somehow -- especially in the fact that i &apos;m in my career .
this is -- you see , i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m only about 40 years old .
i may have another 40 years in my life .
and it &apos;s very , very likely that everything i &apos;m going to be writing from the world is the work that &apos;s going to come from the world of my last book , right ?
i &apos;m going to say right , because we &apos;re all kind of friends here -- it &apos;s very likely that my greatest success is behind me .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
these are the kinds of thoughts that can get someone to start to drink 9 o &apos;clock in the morning , and i don &apos;t want to .
i would rather continue to do this work i love .
so the question is : how ?
after some time of reflection , i seems to realize that i can still write to write a kind of protective analysis .
somehow , i have to find a way to find a way to write a safe distance between me and my very natural plumbs about how to be the reaction .
while i was looking for models in the last year to do this , i was looking for the past , and i tried to find other societies , to see if they might have better or rational ideas to be able to do better or rational ideas about creativity .
this quest me to the old greece and the old rome .
please follow me , because the circle will reclose .
but in the old greece and rome , people didn &apos;t believe that creativity comes from people , ok ?
they believed that creativity was a kind of divine diprime mind that comes out of a distant , unknown source to people -- from untapped , unknown reasons .
the greeks called these divine difolk ghosts of creativity .
and socrates is known that he believed he had an evening , he would have taken out of his body .
the tube had the same idea , called the same kind of body , more creative spirit of a theremin .
this is great . the roman thought wasn &apos;t really that a genius was a particularly clever individual .
they believed that a genius was this kind of magical divinic creature , which was that it was literally lives in the walls of an artist dolney -- about as much as dobby , the house , and the result of the work would be invisible .
this is brilliant -- it &apos;s because there &apos;s a distance that i talked about -- the psychological ingredient that protect you from the consequences of your work .
and everybody knew it was so hard , right ?
the artist of aging was protected by certain things , like , for example , too much narcissm , right ?
if your work was brilliant , you don &apos;t look at everything for you . everybody knew you had this body genius that has helped you .
if your work blew -- not entirely your fault , right ?
everybody knew their genius was something .
so people in the west really have spent a long time thinking about creativity .
and then the renaissance and everything changed , and we had this big idea , and this big idea was : let &apos;s put the human individual into the center of the universe -- across all the gods and mystery , and there &apos;s no room for the mystical creatures .
it &apos;s the beginning of rationism and the people started believing that creativity was completely from their individual individual .
for the first time in history , you hear people call this artist a genius -- instead of making it a genius .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
you know ? i think to allow a blog person , he thinks he thinks , or she &apos;s like the vessel , like the basin and the essence and the source of all divine , creatively , infinite mystery , is a little bit of responsibility to have a human psyche .
it &apos;s like asking somebody to swallow the sun .
and the dissect and distorted egos and it creates all these uncontrollable expectations of success .
i think that this success pressure has broken our artists for the last 500 years .
and , if that &apos;s true , and i think it &apos;s true -- is the question .
can we change it ?
maybe an aging understanding about the relationship between people and the mystery of creative return .
maybe not .
maybe we can &apos;t just defer the thought of 500 years of rational human communication in an 18-minute talk .
and there are certainly people in this audience who would really enrich scientific doubt about the notion of -- basically -- feeins , the people who follow and feenic magic on their projects and so on .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey .
but the question i want to throw out is , why not ?
why not think about that ?
because it makes a lot of sense as everything else that i &apos;ve heard of when it was about trying to explain the absolutely crazy thing of creative process .
a process that -- like anyone who &apos;s ever attempted to do something -- so in other words , in other words , everyone here -- not always rational .
in fact , he can feel really paranormal .
i had recently met such an encounter when i met the extraordinary american difain &apos;s stone , which is now about 90 , but her whole life was digested for her entire life , she told me that she was growing up as she was in the phoenix virginia , she told me she was going to feel and hear how a poem was going on on her .
she said it would be like a baserning from air .
the land on the land would roll .
she felt when it came , because it would take the earth under her feet .
she knew that she could only do one of these at a moment , and that was -- in her words -- agra running like the devil .
she ran like the devil to the house as she was tracking from this poem , and it was just that she had fast enough to make a sheet of paper and a pen so she had to get it through her , and put it on the sheet .
in other words , she was not fast enough , and she ran and ran and ran , but she didn &apos;t get the house , and the poem goes through her , and she said it , and she was going to go on the country , and she would go on and -- like she said , &quot; after another poet . &quot;
and then there were these moments -- the part i &apos;ll never forget -- she said that there were moments in which they were almost discharged .
so , she goes to the house , looking for the paper , and the poem goes through her through her and she reaches a pen as it goes through her , and then she -- she said -- she was going to do it with her other hand .
she got the poem on his tail , and he pulled it back into her body and took it back into paper .
in these opportunities , the poem came out and intact on paper -- but backwards -- from the last word to the first .
when i heard this , i was kind of weird -- that &apos;s exactly how my creative process is going . freeman .
that &apos;s not like my creative process -- i &apos;m not the channel !
i &apos;m a moulanimal . to work , i have to get up every day at the same time , and i &apos;m crying , and i &apos;m really uncomfortable .
but even i have that kind of thing in my rice way sometimes .
and i guess many of you have done this too .
even i had work or ideas that came out of a source that i really couldn &apos;t identify .
what is this for a thing ?
and how do we deal with it without even losing our minds , but to keep ourselves in the opposite of intellectual health ?
for me , the best living example of how to do this is the musicians tom waits . i was interviewing him a few years ago for a magazine .
we talked about this topic , and you know what ? most of the time of his life was tom the embodiment of the modern artist , who was trying to do this uncontrollable creative impulses that would come in and engage with them .
but then he got older and quiet . he told me he was going to go to los angeles one day in los angeles , and everything changed for him .
he was driving at the high speed when he suddenly hears a little segment of a tune , which , as it does with inspiration , is often difficult for him , and he wants to do it , and he &apos;s not going to believe it .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a pencil , he doesn &apos;t have a cassette recorder .
so he begins , this old becliption in him , like the goldilocks i will lose this thing , and will be followed by this song forever .
i &apos;m not good enough , i don &apos;t do it . freeman .
but instead of panic , he just stopped .
he finished all the thought , and he did something completely new .
he looked at the sky , and he said , &quot; hapapologize , can you &apos;t see me driving car ? git .
shekhar i &apos;m looking at this as if i could just write a song ?
if you really want to exist , come back to a more cheap moment , if i can take care of you .
if not , somebody else &apos;s .
go and quries leonard cohen . &quot;
his whole process of labor is changed after that .
not the work itself . it was a lot of times dark than ever .
but the process and the severe beclipment that surrounds him was when he was doing the genius of it , where he didn &apos;t get anything as a anger , and he went back to where he was going to come back . he realized it didn &apos;t have to be a distorted , agonizing thing .
it could be a owners , miraculous , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and the foreign , unconsistent thing , which was not quite tom .
when i heard this story , it also changed a little bit about how i worked and it has been saved .
this is an idea saved by the kind of thing that i was doing in the middle of a typeage process , wisconsin , love , love . i fell into one of the bid of the two-rock we all fall when we &apos;re working on something and it &apos;s not going to be written . you start thinking that it &apos;s going to be a disaster .
not bad , but the worst of all time .
i started thinking , i should just get the project off .
but then i remembered what tom was talking about in the sky , and i tried .
so i raised my view from manuscript and spoke my comments towards an empty corner of the space .
i talked loudly , you know , you know , you and i both know if this book is not brilliant that it &apos;s not completely my fault , right ?
because you see that i have everything i have , invest more . i don &apos;t have more than that .
so if you want to have it better , you &apos;ve got to check up here and hold your share of the weight .
okay . but if you don &apos;t do that ... you know what , the hell with it .
i &apos;ll continue to write , because that &apos;s my job .
and i want to ask you to sample that i was here today for my part of jobs . freeman .
because ... at the end , it &apos;s like following , centuries ago , in the deserts of north america , and accumulated with holy dancers and music that went down for hours -- until dawn .
these fixed ones were always great because the dancers were professional and they were fantastic .
but again , again , very rare , something special happened . one of the character was actually overworld .
and i know you know what i mean , because i know you &apos;ve all seen such a performance in your life before .
it was as if the time is standing , and the dancer are going through a kind of pforte . he did nothing different than he ever had before -- 1,000 nights before , but all added together .
and all of a sudden , he didn &apos;t get into more human .
it was lit up by the inside and down from below , and it lit up and it lit through a divine fire .
when something happened back then , people knew what that was . they called it in his name .
they put the hands together and started singing : git , allah , allah , god , god , god . mini-.
this is god , you know ?
interesting historical footnote : when the moqsouth spain took place , they took this practice . the language changed in the course of paleallah , allah , allah , olé , olé , olé , which you still listen to , and you listen to the steering dancer .
if a dart in spain is an impossible thing to do , something called a magical thing : chloropallah , olé , olé , olé , alush , great , brown , amazing , etc .
and that &apos;s great , because we need it .
but the tricky part of the morning , when the dancers wake up themselves and recognizes that it &apos;s 11 o &apos;clock at a tuesday -- and he doesn &apos;t carry a five-digit of god .
he &apos;s just an aging scream with painful kots , and maybe he &apos;ll never get back to those heights .
and maybe someone will ever call the name of god if he turns . but what would he do with the rest of his life ?
that &apos;s hard .
this is one of the most painful bias of a creative life .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be much like that , if you didn &apos;t believe in the beginning , that the most extraordinary aspects of your existence come from you .
if you may just believe that you &apos;re a nut-core -- from an outrageous source of your life , which is going to go to somebody else when you &apos;re done with it .
when we start thinking about it , it changes everything .
so i started thinking , and i think of safety in the past few months , while i was working on the book , that &apos;s going to come soon -- as the dangerous , frightening , powerful , expected reanticipated of my driving success .
what i &apos;ve always told myself , if i &apos;m going to talk about it , is : have no fear .
don &apos;t be done .
just do your job .
be still for your contribution , whatever he wants to be .
if your job is the dance , you dance .
when the dumb divine genius , which is to give you a page , would decide for a brief moment to show you a little bit of wonder by your effort , then the automatic union !
and if not , actually dance your dance .
and freeman olé ! morefor for all this .
i believe in it and i feel that we should teach .
shekhar olé ! morefor for all this , just for the fact that you have the mere human love and the ability to be there .
thank you .
thank you .
olé !
last year , i showed these two slides to illustrate that the arctic ice caps had the size of the bottom 48 million years to have the size of the bottom 48 states .
but this doesn &apos;t push very much enough to the seriousness of this particular problem , because it doesn &apos;t show the thickness of ice .
in a certain sense , the arctic ice app is the beating heart of our global climate system .
it grows in the winter and shrinking in summer .
the next slide i &apos;m showing you is a time-lapse picture in the last 25 years .
it &apos;s permanently ice .
as you can see , it &apos;s growing up on the dark blue . this is the annual ice in winter ; it &apos;s shrinking in summer .
the so-called equivalent ice , five years old or older , is almost like blood , which is out of the body .
in 25 years , it will be disappeared from here .
this is a problem , because warming is the frozen bottom of the arctic ocean , where there are large amounts of frozen carbon , which , if it &apos;s burking up by microbes .
compared to the entire amount of climate change in the atmosphere , it might double that amount of magnitude when we cross this critical period .
already today in some flat lakes in alaska , methane is methane from self .
professor katey walter , in alaska , traveled to the university of a different kind of work to another flat lake last winter .
wow !
it &apos;s good . the question is , how will it be ?
and one reason is that this huge warmer rains out of the north .
this is a annual escape river .
but the volume is much bigger than ever before .
this is the canary southeast river in southern west greenland .
if you want to know how the sea level goes up through land ice , it goes down into the ocean .
these rivers take rapid .
at the other end of the planet , antarctica , the largest iceberg on the planet .
last month , researchers , the whole continent now has a negative sheet of ice .
and the west antarctica that came across a couple of underwater islands is especially in melt .
this is 20 feet of marine height , like greenland .
in the himalayas , the third largest ice mass , you see new lakes that were a few years ago .
40 percent of all the people in the world get half the water from this melting water .
in the indonesia , this glacier is the water source for these city .
the water amounts of water have escalated .
but if you rush out , most of the water will fall away too .
in california , a 40-percent reduction in the sierra ice was seen .
this is the memory ponds .
and the predictions of how you read them are serious .
these corstrockbacks in the world lead to a dramatic increase in fire .
and the disasters in the world have been in a really extraordinary and very extraordinary and unprecedented approach .
four and a half years in the last 30 years as in the previous age .
this is a totally unfair developmental pattern .
if you look at this in historical context , you can see what it does .
in the last five years , we produced 70 million tons of co2 co2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons every day in the oceans .
look at the area of the eastern pacific right now , from the american continent west , and beistence of the indian subcontinent , where there &apos;s a drastic decline in the ocean .
the biggest single factor for global warming , besides deforestation , which is 20 percent , is burning from fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the biggest biggest problem .
the united states is one of the two largest polluters , with china .
and the proposal was to build many more carbon factories .
but we start to see a change .
here are the ones around the last few years , with some green alternatives that were proposed .
generally , there is a political argument in our country .
and the kohles and opleds have spent a quarter-billion dollars last year to promote clean coal , which is a contradiction in itself .
this picture reminded me of something .
around christmas , at home , at home in tennessee , a billion tons of kohlons .
they saw it in the news .
this is in our whole country of the second largest waste of america .
this was about christmas .
one of the commercials of the cohlture industry around christmas was this .
frosty the hydroman is a pleasure , happy burdian .
there &apos;s it in the skin , and it &apos;s in america , and it &apos;s helping our economy grow .
frosty , the hydroman will clean up every day .
he &apos;s affordable , and he &apos;s going to stay in lohn and bread .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
the most powerful mountain workers is the director of massey coal .
let me tell you a very clearly . al gore , nancy pelosi , harry reid , you don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
so the alliance for climate protection has two campaigns in life .
this is one part of her .
in coalergy , we see climate change as a serious danger for our business .
that &apos;s why we put it on top of the top line , a sizable amount of money to get a commercial action on the way to the truth of coal .
in fact , coal is not dirty .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it &apos;s still good .
so , don &apos;t worry about the climate change .
let &apos;s leave that .
seber charcoal , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
so let &apos;s make a tour of this modern , clean coal factory .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty noisy .
but it &apos;s the sound of the clean coal technology .
and yet the burning of coal is one of the main reasons for global warming , which is remarkable clean carbon technology that you see here .
look at this , this is the right , clean carbon technology .
finally , the positive alternative with our economic challenge , and our challenge of national security .
america is in a crisis , the economy , the national security , the climate crisis .
the red thread that all connect to this is our dependence on carbon power materials like dirty coal and foreign oil .
but now there is a bold new solution to free us from this kind of misdness .
help america with 100 percent clean electricity within the next 10 years .
a plan to bring america back to work , to make us safer and help stop the global warming .
finally , a solution that &apos;s large enough to solve our problems .
support america . find more out .
this is the last .
it &apos;s about a new benefit of america .
one of the fastest ways our dependence on old , dirty power materials , to reduce our world .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
new investments to create well-paid jobs .
support america . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
there &apos;s an old african saying , &quot; if you want to be quick , go alone .
if you want to get far , go together . &quot;
we need to get far , and it &apos;s fast .
thank you .
i want to start asking you to think about the time of your childhood , when you were playing with a tree .
as you realized how to pull out your hands and intervene out the fog , you actually learned , you know , to think and solve problems through that and change the spatial connections .
the spatial thinking is closely connected to how we understand a lot of our environment .
as a computer scientist -- inspired by the kind of interaction with real objects -- together with my professional advisti , and my colleagues jeevan kalanithi , i began to wonder , what if we could do a computer that &apos;s like a digital fingernail , which is like , if we could do it with both hands , which is like , what if we could be able to do it with both hands , which is like , what if we could use it ?
so this question was that we decided that we decided to study the answer and the sigraries .
in short , there &apos;s an interactive computer in the size of a cone .
you can move with your hand , you can perceive each other , you can detect your movements and you have a screen and you have a radio receiver .
much more importantly , are physically , so you can only do it as the buildent of the hands through the hands of hands and access .
and the sigraries are an example of a new generation of aid to the manipulation of digital data .
and if these tools are going to grow and become an awareness for their movements , you can see each other , and the intricacties of our rebuilding with them , then we can begin with exploration new and entertaining interaction types .
i start with some simple examples .
this sigrable thing for the video refiguery , and if i put it in a direction , the video will move forward ; when i go to the other direction , it &apos;s going backwards .
and these interactive portraits take each other true .
so if i put them on side , they make their interest .
and when you &apos;re in severe , you &apos;ll notice that , and you can get a little nervous .
and they also feel their movement and curve .
an interesting consequence of the interactions that we started to recognize was that we could apply everyday gestures on data , like the color of how we do this with fluid .
in this case , we have three sictaries as a color of paint , and i can use it to cast color in the middle , where they will mix .
if we overrun it , we can download a little bit .
there are also some pretty nice opportunities in education as languages , math or logists , where we give people the possibility of fast experimentation and the results immediately want to see .
here i am -- this is a fibonacci series that i do with a simple program .
this is a game with words , which is a kind of mixture of scrabble and boggle .
basically , every single round of the time you get to every sigrable , random letter , and you &apos;re trying to form words , you &apos;re going to test these over a dictionary .
then , after about 30 seconds , again , again , again , again , you get a new letter and new opportunities to try .
thank you .
these are some kids on a trip to media lab , and i could move them to try and make a video of it .
they really loved it .
an interesting thing about this kind of applications is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
everything you have to say is &quot; create words &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
here &apos;s another couple of people test it .
this is our youngest step down there on the right .
it turns out he wanted to just stack the sigrity .
so for him , they were just stacking .
this is an interactive mismatch .
we wanted to develop a tool for language learning .
this is felix .
he can bring new characters into the scene using the sictiable from the table , showing that character .
here he goes to the sun .
the sun goes up .
now he &apos;s turning a tractor into the scene .
the orange tractor .
good work ! yes !
by shaking the sigraries , and it can make them interact side-by-side .
... his own story .
hello !
it &apos;s a story with open end and it can decide how they evolve .
flying cat .
the last example i &apos;ve spent time today is to show it , is a musical composer for live performances that we &apos;ve developed recently and in the sigraries as a sound of leadership , like leadership , bass and batting stuff .
each one has four different variations ; you can select what you want to use .
and you can eat those sounds into the sequence that you can re-arrange in any pattern .
and you take them , you know , by just holding a sound to a speaker &apos;s light .
there are effects that you can change live , like hall and filter .
you put it together with a particular clay , and then you put it on .
and then again , the effects of how speed and volume , which you put on the whole sequence .
so let &apos;s see .
we begin to eat the leadership of the leadership in two chapters , and put them in a row , expand and add a bit more of the voice .
now i add a bass .
now i &apos;m going to do something about it .
and now i &apos;m doing the filter with the batacle , so i can drive the effect of live .
i can accelerate the whole sequence by putting the pace into one way or another .
and now i &apos;m doing the filter again with the bass , for something more expression .
i can make the sequence as she goes around .
so , i don &apos;t have to plan it in the forefield , but it can be improvise ; it &apos;s going to make it happen or smooth .
and finally , i can split the whole sequence by running the volume to the left .
thank you .
so as you can see , my excitement is to develop new new computer cuts , which are better to fit how our brains and bodies work .
and today i had time to give you a part of this new design world and some of the possibilities of what we work on in our lab .
the idea that i &apos;d like to leave you with is that we &apos;re on the verge of this new generation of value to the digital media with digital media to bring information into our world , which is our demands .
thank you .
i &apos;m delighted to talk to you all !
yeah , good afternoon .
i &apos;m delighted i &apos;m there .
yeah , so what should biohacking be ?
i &apos;ve got to get a little bit out of it , and that &apos;s a biography of biodiversity with the modern molecular biology .
i study molecular biology , and i &apos;ve been doing it for a couple of years now with the biohacking , and i started , because i just wanted to know , because i wanted to know how to do something like this in the study of theoretical theory .
so , that was my primary motivation .
so it was a curiosity , and i wanted to sort of go closer to matter .
i think the molecular biology in general now is , in general , talking , biotechnology , everything you count , synthetic biology and so forth .
extremely important , now it &apos;s extremely important , and a lot more , much more important in the future .
there are so sophisticated things that have changed all the genetic plants on the branches .
there are now craig venter in the united states trying to make biofuel , so gasoline from algae .
and then there are things that have already come out of the everyday life , what most people don &apos;t really know , for example , like determedists , which allow us to wash up with four degrees of laundry .
and the list can continue to continue .
and so out of interest in this technology , i &apos;m just further on this technology .
so why now ?
most people know the most people from the software .
computers , and then it will always be in the media , yes , the hackers break somewhere and claws data and so on .
it &apos;s kind of sad for the hackerscene very sad because that doesn &apos;t actually cause what you actually started , and what &apos;s actually behind it .
and the software hacker , in the seventh &apos; 70s , started with computer phones , and it &apos;s also created the internet .
and it &apos;s about a playful , creative , original way to solve a problem .
and the problem is that it &apos;s not just a technical problem , it can be a social problem , it can be just a problem of what things are encouraging , which is how things do , and how do you do it better .
and it &apos;s been given to software , but it &apos;s also in the electric field , because there &apos;s a whole building scene that can do with electric circuits all kinds of things .
and now , in the direction of biology , and i want to take this metaphor that comes out of synthetic biology , that biology is actually an information of information , because , the d.n.a code is an abstract code , which is the d.n., because it &apos;s a matter of matter , it &apos;s not just the same thing .
but it &apos;s also a code that you can also program , and you can also program it , and that &apos;s what i found , and that &apos;s what i found incredibly fascinating , and i just wanted to get a lot deeper .
this has actually taken two thousand really forms , that these networks .
there &apos;s hacking h. org , which is originally from switzerland , which is with europe and with an cooperation in india , but now members or active people around the world .
this is a more artistic alignment , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers and working with scientists with these sorts of technologies , and asking them to take away with these technologies and ask them , and that &apos;s creative .
but it &apos;s actually always about finding such a blade of access , such a playful effort .
and then there is do-it-yourself organic dot , d.i.y.organic .
this is from the united states a network , which is actually more like a forum where where you find yourself and online .
they &apos;re a little bit more technical , and they &apos;re also a little bit of business , they &apos;re also asking , yes , asking questions .
and based on these networks that have been doing the whole popular thing , it has evolved a scene that i want to give you a little bit of .
here in the picture on the left you see biomacy , which is a hackerspace , so basically a kind of school , so a private school , a nonprofit , where everyone can come .
children , old , all kinds of people , to just get out of it , they &apos;ve entered a lab and look at what can be done when these lab reports go .
here on the lower left is a group in indonesia , house areas of natural stereotypes called the , but it &apos;s quite a long time .
already longer than those other networks .
these are also in such an artistic aspect with biological materials and , yes , electric stability , and combine that in pretty much way .
a group of moara , who i met a couple of times ago , that &apos;s a student group that would like to give the public more , what they want to learn in college , and they &apos;ve been trying to explain what d.n.a is .
and i &apos;ve got a lecture on the other picture in copenhagen in the medical museum in copenhagen with an exhibition for the subject .
and this is , yes , that &apos;s usually quite young people , but the only thing which is actually all united , is this fascination in technology .
and what you can do with it , and you can just get to the society with it and ask you to ask , okay , what do you do , what do you want to do ?
so , o.k , for biology now , you need some material .
you need biological materials , of course , and you also need tools , and that &apos;s a lab .
in a way , what you usually understand under a lab , these are kind of lidious machines , extremely expensive , extremely expensive , just for professionals , educated academics with graduate students and so on .
and our approach was to say , well , o.k , that actually you don &apos;t have to do that .
this is actually not necessary , because every one of each coffee has actually evolved , actually , more sophisticated technology than most of the lab devices , that &apos;s really like that .
and the o with this premise with this premise then , for example , tried to put brian degger in england , and then he took a minimal print together , took a heat plate , a heat plate , and then has grown bacteria .
so every one of you who has a soup of soup , which he left for too long , is even done .
i then tried this in my lab , which is a little scale , and then i took a hold of equipment to ebay on ebay and a bit of a d.n.a analysis , trying to do a father test , and so on .
that should actually not be a joke now , but .
here in the picture here , you can see the lab , in leadership , so it &apos;s such a common garage with so much of the possible lab tricks that the university of college has had a group in paris , which is a group of what has been doing , and quite quite interesting things , so i &apos;m also going to cut a project .
and this is biomacy , which also mentioned hacking space , this one , kind of a folk school principle for molecular biology .
and yes , you know , you can see , it &apos;s relatively sophisticated , so there &apos;s a lot of people who are doing that at home , so far to big , major organizations who are going to do more of it in institutional form .
but always the approach is that it should be easy and available .
the first project we did as an international group , as we were kind of aware of ourselves , is we &apos;re now here as a real scene , and we &apos;re online , and we know the people that are there forever and so on .
and then just from the do-it-yourself organic international website of the founder , and he said o.k , we &apos;re also going to have to meet , even though , and then organized two events in london , and then in the united states , in san francisco , in san francisco .
and then , because then it was about , yes , yeah , who are we , what do we want to do ?
and what are our values and what is our goal , our foundation ?
and then we &apos;ve been working as a code-range of hype .
that was quite intuitive , so everybody &apos;s got his wishes just like this , and that , and what it takes , then , said , then .
so , my opinion was to do a very good code .
and then we did not have commitment , but that &apos;s what i think is , i think , pretty well , that people are right about this .
and we even tried to bring that back into the academic world , but it &apos;s kind of not so arrived .
so i think we &apos;re out of the biohacker scene in terms of even one step more than the academic world .
yeah , what do we do now ?
a project that i did with the hacking network in switzerland , was that we wanted to build an optical event or optical buzette .
this is , if you focus a laser beam on one in the room , then you can capture little particles in the air or in the liquid , and then move in that focus , so that &apos;s what you &apos;re doing .
it really works , that &apos;s going to be done in academia , and then we thought , o.k , we might have taken a webcam , and then we &apos;ve taken a webcam , which is the lens , and then you turn a microscope , it &apos;s about four hundred times .
this is what you see down there .
and then we &apos;ve measured a d.v.d brenner , and the burning would pull out the laser and then try to focus on this camera .
and unfortunately , it didn &apos;t work , but we &apos;ve learned a lot about it yet .
so another project that looks like this from the french group of paris , which has worked , that &apos;s pretty cool .
and in fact , he has such a kind of brain wave block , so e. e. or something , so he &apos;s engaged with neurobiology , his nickname is sam neurohack .
he then got this helmet carrying this helmet , and in the cooperation with the museum , he walked .
and then there were the visitors in the room going into the room , sit down on this chair .
then their brainwaves were measured , and depending on what they thought , or how they thought , is then different lights in the room .
it was a pretty neat project .
another thing from the united states that has just been to do with this dad &apos;s history is the hulc.r , which is the polymerasan inreaction , complicated word .
so it &apos;s about copying genes , to reproduce , to multiply hillary , to reproduce , to get them visible .
so if i do that now the profiler on the scene , then go there , go there , collect any hair samples , and then they make that method , and then they can say , you know , o.k , this hair , you know , this hair .
and the machines that are doing that kind of thing are quite expensive that you &apos;re buying , the cheapest go to four thousand euros .
and that &apos;s not in the hobbying-nest , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that can also do much .
so this is just an application of many that you can do with it .
and they have so , you know , the lowest venders , and they said , you know , there are two things that we do , and we &apos;re going to make this simple and cheaper , and then you get out of open source , so open hardware , open hardware , that &apos;s the cheapest vends of the world .
i think somehow as hexshas dollars or something like that .
but anyway , it &apos;s still not cheap , but it &apos;s definitely in a frame where it &apos;s going to be clear .
so i think it &apos;s a very bad hack .
a project i started to build recently was a gun gun .
gene gun is , yes , like a kind of air print , which is about as far as two centimeters or something .
you put d.n.a on gold particles and the gold particles in this air print , and then i &apos;ve shot up on onion , and then i put the lights up to it .
so the device you see is not working .
but this is so my prototype , which has been pretty lowed , and pretty much looked like this , so on a branch , the thing , electronics on it , and that was the pressure that was broken .
and then i took a saunoff , and that &apos;s what it was about .
a saunese , if you make the full power of water with water , the enough pressure , so i think it &apos;s about 40 to six .
and with that , then you can accelerate the particles very much , and then you go into it .
and the commercial device costs about five thousand euros up or something like this , saunespendie of the 50 .
so it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically feasible .
and that &apos;s the point right now in the moment the core cause of the scene is to increase these availability of technology and also increase the information and the understanding that more people can get involved .
because , in the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have relatively little idea of it and also not a chance of making it really good .
because if you just read about it , it &apos;s not the same thing as if you did it yourself or seen it .
and i think technology will always be more important in our modern societies .
and if you want to be an informed citizen in the society , you want to be able to speak and talk to you , you need access to knowledge and technology .
and you also have to do it and understand it and understand it .
and then it turns out , under the slivement , there &apos;s slills and citizen science .
so , as citizens , you &apos;ll be able to get out of the situation with these scientific technologies .
and that &apos;s the core cause of the biohacker .
these are the people who have at least officially gathered on the website , d.i.y.bio-meg website .
this is a relatively substantial number of people worldwide .
and what &apos;s interesting is also that they &apos;re in southeast asia .
this is i think that there are fewer people in there than actually exist .
so i know some who don &apos;t have that in .
and these are just the biohacker , the individual people .
in part , with these hackers , these places put together .
and that &apos;s really in the beginning .
as i said , two of them first started it .
and hacking obstacles , so the computer hacking , because the c base in berlin was the first nine hundred hundred thousand .
and this is now a giant network of very good , yes , infrastructural centers that are represented around the world .
and , of course , we hope that we &apos;re going to take a similar way , and we &apos;re also similar to related , so that we can get more people involved .
and i would invite everybody to deal with it and even try and do something like that .
it &apos;s not so easy now , but it &apos;s not impossible , if you &apos;ve got enough curiosity and enough energy , then you get there too .
thank you for listening .
that &apos;s it .
yeah , hello .
how do we actually work ?
this is a question that is very moving to me as a designer , but also in the area of the research area in the area of any sense of freedom .
it &apos;s about how people walk in an interactive media so that they can use these interactive media and make them a very satisfying experience .
because i believe that the interactive media in our archaic , cognitive models address , so patterns that have been programmed in our biological memory very , very long time , and that we can only recreate through interactive media .
and that &apos;s very amazing , because you actually believe that this technology that you saw in the future is actually bringing you to the future , but in fact it &apos;s so that the future is right at us with our archaic roots .
so what are the spores now ?
i &apos;ve been writing four words , and i &apos;d like to quickly explain that briefly .
archaic cognitive models and that &apos;s the models that we &apos;ve been able to have in the pre-industrial times .
to these archaese models that we have a universal relationship to virtual functionality .
this is basically what sounds unusual .
i &apos;m going to go back to that again and get to show you that you also have a natural relationship in the virtual .
the second aspect is that since this archaic models , we &apos;ve been able to speak very , very , very , very , very much though we &apos;re using a healing language .
and the third area , which actually explains itself .
we all know that the interactive media is by definition of nonlinear , which involves the regulity of the linearity , and of course what we say is that we now feel the linearity as normal .
the fourth point is that the story for us is a place of information .
now , how about the virtuality , which is actually the most natural thing in the world ?
i want to show you that .
how many gardens have the house in which they live ?
we &apos;re not going to be able to answer them immediately , but it &apos;s going to happen right now .
they go through the spirit of this house , in ann they live , and look at how many doors there are .
and that &apos;s what they &apos;re doing .
they &apos;re virtual , the reality , without computers .
fantastic , right ?
and what we &apos;re doing is we &apos;re very hard to have a meditation campus for the virtual reality in our v.rs lab , we can actually do this all the time .
and this kind of wealth is the virtual part of the reality to virtual , the people in the pre-industrial times , because they didn &apos;t have anything .
they didn &apos;t have books .
or they didn &apos;t have any photoligraphy .
they had no mass media .
the only thing that they had was their head .
and in this mind , the memory was happening .
in this head , knowledge was called , and with this virtual images , the imagination , you know , was passed on .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s so strong in us that we can deal with virtual functionality .
the interesting thing about this is if i can make a little trip .
yeah , this is .
the interesting thing about this is that the human producer at the same time was media producer and medium itself .
now , if you think about it a bit now .
what are media media today ?
then you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s been a change .
but i &apos;ll talk to you about that again .
most of the tools of information prevention have been made for granted .
shaman , priests , called the knowledge of knowledge , were made for extra wisdom to keep knowledge in stories .
and even today we &apos;re getting very , very strong stories .
the author of the book earth , jonathan god cheall , and we &apos;re still fed by a hundred and a half hours a year with the reception of stories .
that means that for a child that &apos;s going to be able to achieve most of the time for the most significant of the life of its life .
now we think our love to stories depends on us as a child on the lap of our parents .
no , no , no .
this is a lot further back to the cultures of the pre-industrial times .
but for me , in the area of an interactive media , as particularly impressive as it is in our biological memory , the ability to think of nonlinear .
i brought to you an example of the north american tribe of the native american tribe .
and life lived in the coastal 1900s of british columbia .
and as you can see , this is a very island area , and you had to navigate there somehow from island to island to raise food .
and they did this with so-called so-called land maps .
you may also know , if you &apos;re interested in this , from the australian ancient people .
they have similar principles .
they don &apos;t have lead-land maps , but they have used that kind of plastic sonine , or a traumatic mess .
and what &apos;s interesting about this is that the navigation and the topography could be mapped by areas about songs .
with the language of the language , the language was understated .
that means you have navigied over sound and about rhythm .
and these sound and this rhythm have the geology , the topography of a region , and that , of course , enabled that you could cut these songs and put it in different places , and then go back to the equivalent of the end .
why don &apos;t we sing anymore to come from a b to b ?
anyway , to navigate .
what &apos;s actually happening ?
this is so gene &apos;s machine &apos;s machine .
we &apos;ve done something called birds &apos;s age .
this is the machine age , and it &apos;s happened the book , and it &apos;s the photolitography .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens to us that we have the responsibility for our memories and our individual memories of our individual memories .
on the book , on the book .
so unfortunately , we have a piece of reasons to recycle god .
virtuality suddenly has become alien for us , and has nothing to do with the reality .
bruce brown , a famous design researcher at the brighton university , is so far to say that this media media , he means the book , and the image , so not television , the internet , and so on , what we call a mass media , and our ability to have a virtual media .
let &apos;s make a little line .
from vogt-age to the machine age .
what has an impact on our thinking and our memory ?
and then we have trouble the pre-industrial civilizations .
and they have been more and more overheld in the course of the centuries of the machine .
that is , rather than recall us , we have standardized , far widespread , in mass spread of memories that we can depend on our personal memories .
we don &apos;t produce anymore .
we have a abstract , abstract language .
we don &apos;t think of the thing anymore in pictures that things don &apos;t look like in pictures , but we suppress them our language .
we have used it to be linear .
and we accepted the linearity as a law , and there are only exceptions , like the nonlinearity .
what has remained us is the hurdy-gurdy .
we &apos;re still very , very vividly as information training .
the question is , what &apos;s next ?
we had the voster age , we had the machine institute and we &apos;re going to describe the cyber age .
it sounds very fashiely , and it sounds very hard for science fiction , i know .
but these concepts of cyber age that bring us these opportunities back to us again again .
it &apos;s about virtuality , it &apos;s about nonlinearity , it &apos;s about git .
i want to explain that briefly a little bit .
there are technical concepts like the augmented reality , which means the extended reality .
so for example , if you look at google hype , then it &apos;s a concept that makes us recombine the virtual world with the real world , which is called our affunity to virtual , the virtual , natural , to feel again .
another example is called virtual reality .
so , of course , that &apos;s crazy in the context of my talk , because we may be able to move physically into not existing , virtual worlds , all the way out of the ganges .
and other examples are the ambient , intelligent systems .
these are rooms that can respond to one person .
all of this needs the ability to accept our basic ability to accept virtual property as a real habitat .
i graduated in graduate , and i hope the video works , a very , very beautiful project , which is the bachelal work of michael burk , anf-kag , and jan-moritz .
and the two of them are also here today .
maybe you can stand up , so you can get up with the two over the project .
and i brought this project as an example of how back to this archaic , cognitive models .
the whole thing is a game i have to say .
so , of course , what the hurdy-gurdy is , and it &apos;s a computer game .
and when i say computer games , they have very likely to believe that any people in front of people are happy about some of the people in their hands , or they play with them with some of them .
anyway , that you do that .
that &apos;s a game outside .
and that &apos;s what &apos;s meant to suggest that i follow the outside world , so i discover the real world again .
and this game connects the virtual world , so the data is the data that we produce with the real world .
i apologize that i have to cut so much off .
you can explain that much better , because there &apos;s more and more behind it .
and it &apos;s that i &apos;m going to discover a city by looking at what places in places positive or negative .
and so i get from the city to a very different kind of view , which is , i see negative and positive zones of a city , and i get this kind of way , a very different , virtual map of a very real city .
and we can now look at that .
ah , what you can see here , sorry is another little explanation of what you see .
of course , this virtual world lives in the walls of our cities , right ?
and with a kind of light , we can make these virtual worlds visible .
so , i &apos;d like to wrap this up to my talk , which is that the properties and the skills that we &apos;ve acquired from the voster age , and that we &apos;ve gone back to a little bit of a bit of the technology that we have , in the context of the cyber age , that we can actually turn back to that kind of cyber age .
thank you .
yeah , i &apos;m very happy to be with you .
i &apos;ve just been asked if this bag is there , and i &apos;m going to talk about it .
it &apos;s not going to do that .
i &apos;m also going to fix what &apos;s inside .
but i &apos;ve just been curious about it yet .
yeah , kids are curious about curious or should be curious , designers .
i &apos;m the house of house , which is , of course , i &apos;m also dealing with the subject of curiosity and how the curiosity is also changing our thinking , and why are we going to lose curiosity and have to repel and have to repel it and have to go back to it ?
this is a whole series of things that you &apos;re dealing with next to the actual promise of the kind of thing .
if professors are curious , they &apos;re often immersed in the process of research .
and that &apos;s what i had in the last half a year .
a research class for natural user interface design .
now , you &apos;re going to ask yourself why the whole age of age starts with such natural , archaic forms of communication , interaction and so on .
and i just like one of these little devices , because the things should always be more intuitive , always more natural , use , and you have to take a look at what is , of course , what is usable or intuitively .
and in front of the background , i was in the realm of natural user interface , so the next generation in the human computer in order to deal with the human computer in the human computer is how our tools or how computers behave from the computer to the digital assistant .
so i &apos;ve been working on this when , of course , what , or intuitively .
maybe you have to look up again .
why does that happen ?
so if we look at the development of our society , here &apos;s how we look at it , we &apos;re now going to move out of the third generation of social generation or society .
so from modern society .
every society is defined by a primary medium .
at the beginning , the tribal society is through the language .
that means you &apos;ve found that you &apos;ve talked to a common language , you could communicate with each other , in the same cave , or in other areas , has developed cities or villages , and has evolved to create a rural society .
but the primary medium was the language , something very natural , something very natural .
you also have to learn , you know , no small child can talk about nature , but we &apos;re learning it , of course , sukzalia and discourse .
it was then solved by the ancient society and the first form of abstraction .
this was a huge outcry , because , of course , you started to manifest the language of language in the form of writing , which is what fluid and life is , let me start it and put it in stone and do it .
and as i chel and when i sing , of course , it &apos;s a very different coverage , when there &apos;s a kind of alive .
but sukzalia then moved this script as the primary medium , led .
and then the next generation in which we actually live today .
this is just using pressure and print writing with a guberg and others .
it was the same as a hallucinating , where adolus and some other people have said : are you crazy when the people start reading , then they want to talk , and that &apos;s completely equipped .
and now we come to the next generation , and the exciting thing is , this is just a series of a hundred hundred years , and we &apos;re really in this phenomenal phase right now that we are doing this .
that confused us completely , of course , because we see on the one side that new media media media , facebook social media , facebook , and so on .
with the total transparency , what the new thinking is , what does it look like , don &apos;t tell you that in laser agne &apos;s meat , and no beef , i want to do that , and i want to do that at all .
and these two worlds all right now , new and old thinking .
the exciting thing about this is , if you look at this , this new society , this computer society , it &apos;s a lot of mechanisms , a lot of mechanisms , principles and archatic paradigm from the tribal society .
but now not in the local level , but on global level .
we understood that the weather is global .
that the theme of ecology is a global .
not , if i think of local green and neighbor &apos;s neighbor &apos;s neighbor , it doesn &apos;t work .
that is , from the local village , a global village has become a global village with the same principles , of course , very intuitive , but also the total transparency .
as you know in the village at the time , who has something with who and when , this is what happens to us today about this expansion of our self through these mobile devices .
it is that we know we know global contributions and faster and better .
as it used to be , it just happened on the village .
in front of the background , i &apos;ve just been busy looking at what &apos;s meant to us , what is it for us , which is , of course , what &apos;s going on for us , what is the difference for us , but what is the difference ?
because often people get there , they can &apos;t use it , so everyone can &apos;t use it .
so you have to deal with what &apos;s called , because it &apos;s not just changing it , but it &apos;s also going to be better .
and then , of course , when it &apos;s a little bit intuitive , and as i can , as i can , as a age of age , and just kind of designed things like that , they &apos;re a friendly , friendly , intuitive , because then they &apos;re fun to use .
you &apos;re also busy working on the study of perception and the subject of perception and perception .
and that &apos;s also what , of course , where you start and look and say , okay , now i just look into the inner self .
and what does it look like in it ?
so how do we work if we zoom in there ?
and what does it mean , of course , intuitively and how to work our channels of perception and how the cognitive processing works ?
because steve has said to you , you know , a moderer to shuffer .
so you really have to look at the details , if i want to make something friendly or intuitive manual , which is the core .
and there you have , you know , a man &apos;s seven senses , most of us think of only five , right now , it &apos;s even seven , and it certainly occurred in the near future , and as an extension of our self .
and to look at how we process information , how do we take information ?
to say , alone , what is information ?
information is every difference that matters .
many people use the word , but they don &apos;t even know what it means .
but i have to understand , in the essence , understanding in the essence of information when the information becomes information , when will information become information , and from information , so i know how i do things as well , and of course possible .
and , of course , as design impact on perception .
we see this , if i do things , then i can design them like on the right , where i don &apos;t know what is salt and pepper , or i can sort of design it , by showing things .
so a lot of natural , in a vessel , but i &apos;m sort of looking directly where salt and pepper is in there .
and when i say somebody , let me give you salt or pepper , then he &apos;ll think about where is what &apos;s inside .
and on the left just intuitive access , and then hopefully i hope that there &apos;s no sugar in it , just to give the salt to it .
but also our perception itself , as it does , as well .
for example , this perception in context .
the right circle looks bigger than the little , even though it &apos;s not the case , but they &apos;re just equally equally size , and yet our perceptions , depending on what context we put in .
anyone know what that is ?
come on .
shekhar sensing is going to work .
there &apos;s more to my glasses there .
so it &apos;s &apos; n circle .
a second circle already starts to coordinate certain similarities or associate .
and if i take a hold of time , then we don &apos;t even see a unit , which is circle , circle , circle and , but we see a unit , we don &apos;t see a circle , a circle , a circle .
this is what you call the rule law , or something that also affects us in perception .
it &apos;s important for the age of the age , most of the first semester laws .
law law nearby , the continuity of the continuity and so on .
they &apos;ve often forgotten in the third .
but this is an essential important component , if you want to design things equally intuitive .
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting , is the vision of vision .
it sounds very banal , but it &apos;s kind of exciting when you get closer to it .
so we have the eyes in front of the face , and now you think we &apos;re looking at the back .
that &apos;s wrong .
you see at the end of the back .
which is , you make an assumption for the front that you see something that you can see .
that means we &apos;re only going to see our vision before we see it coming back in our sehemachine , to say , okay .
i have this cognitive retreat , you &apos;ve got what you want to see .
that &apos;s then there , then coming back .
then it goes back to the front , because the back of the back doesn &apos;t go and say , well , i &apos;m going to look at it , and i &apos;m sure you &apos;re going to see if that &apos;s what you see .
and then it goes back to the back and then it &apos;s actually going to be seen .
so a whole , exciting thing about how certain things happen , and what kind of milliseconds of things are happening these things .
i don &apos;t know who you know of this picture .
that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;ve been describing .
now everyone &apos;s trying to recognize something from this pattern .
i don &apos;t know who you see .
does anybody see something specific ?
a bollywood matiner , right .
once i saw that , that &apos;s a dalmatiner in there , you know that .
you &apos;ll never forget , because i &apos;m going to show you where the permamatiner is .
now you see the permamatiner .
and further , you &apos;ll see it .
that is , i &apos;ve actually figured it out now that they don &apos;t recognize any patterns in this , but i &apos;ve done it in a short time , ever again , to see this dog in this literal picture .
and that &apos;s this projection of vision , feedback , vision .
now i know , and now i &apos;m going to go forward to the front that i see the acceleration .
i see the dalmatiner .
so , quite exciting processes that are in this , yes , gray , it &apos;s actually not , but here in this red crowd , it just resembles .
anyone know what three seconds are ?
long , yes .
this is our present present .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as a designer .
if i know something about three seconds , until i kind of get out of the classroom in the past , i can also talk very well in the past of the arts , and i &apos;m also very good at the moment when i was doing it with a three seconds .
it has to process it as present .
and then it goes into the past and i can get very elegant at the computer , for example , when i know this phenomenon .
what takes five and a half milliseconds ?
yeah , milliseconds .
a very exciting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the time where you fall in love .
what that means is , you know , if you know that , look at who you &apos;re looking at , because i &apos;m not going to pick up any time for what &apos;s going on .
and six milliseconds , a very interesting phenomenon .
this is the period of most perceptions that we have .
that means this first impression is happening in a rapid fast speed , as we perceive things .
and as we see things , what we &apos;re looking at and how we &apos;re sort of going to protect ourselves against our environment , so we can think about that .
of course , the age of the age is not just about the subject and neural processing , or cognitive processing , but mostly of course with the subject of human-objective relationship .
so , how does a human deal with certain things ?
there are product linguers that are practical , so formal aspects , or formalistic aspects .
there &apos;s computation functions where i know exactly where i really need to reach .
but there &apos;s also symbolic functions , why is there anybody for such a little bit of fun where there &apos;s almost nothing fit in it , so that it &apos;s not so convenient ?
and we &apos;re more interested in the symbolic level that we think of as the age of course , of course .
back to the theme of natural user interface , and the theme of what , of course , is in uslan .
usmize always means how to achieve a certain goal , or how to do a user in a particular benefit context , efficient and happiness a goal .
that &apos;s what the norm says about .
how can i make something friendly ?
i can use that directly or i can use it , or i need to do it , or i need to do it .
and less hype or user is it .
that i do it differently and beautiful , doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s better handable .
you have to understand that .
and if you were to be part of the software that we &apos;ve just seen , then you &apos;ll understand why nine percent of our software &apos;s software is slightly intuitive or not useful to the point of the software that i did , and it &apos;s not useful to be useful in many areas , but it &apos;s also quite intuitive than classical software .
in fact , intuitive users have not only been a fundamental economic factor for apple , most elementary success factor , if i just want to make technological equipment .
why ?
because in the rule of using this new kind of value , the natural user , for example , is five times more likely to our goal .
you &apos;ve got to imagine that if you do something of the classical sombering , five hours , and with this new kind of natural software , just one hour .
that doesn &apos;t mean that you can probably go home four more hours , but your employer or somebody , you know , will have a , as he does with the four hours .
but i want to say that , of course , it &apos;s a major increase for us , too , to make certain things .
so if we go back to the software in the software , the first mini-line interface , which was very abstract , where we needed months to deal with these systems .
then the next one , which is already with &quot; tiger neural model , &quot; or mental model like the software eergonists , worked , you have an idea of something that the metaphor of a desktop , the metaphor of a desktop to make the computer .
so no longer zeros and zeros , or siyptic codes , but a metaphor .
it &apos;s a lot more powerful , but it &apos;s also a lot better .
the next generation of graphics shows has been working very much more with behavior .
so , there &apos;s a lot of more common behavior than the age of the behavior .
this is also a paradigm shift .
so , that &apos;s always what happens to be unimportant for the success , right now is an app app .
and if i take a step further into these natural user interfaces , where i &apos;m talking about voice , by speech , by touch , by gesture and gesture , things have to drive , and the things that have to drive , i &apos;m even more and more respected .
but that also leads me to the point again , when are things going to be more intuitive ?
if you become intuitive and then i have to go back to my little friend here , and see what does that mean from the point of cognition , when is it really something intuitive ?
and that &apos;s always a bit intuitive for us , when i have to think about it very much .
so it doesn &apos;t seem to be like to think , but it &apos;s kind of easy to do .
the less i kind of think about it , the more intuitive it is .
and what does that mean for the designers ?
that means that if we look at that we can transmit existing models from one thing to another one , for example , the metaphor , then i can make it as the age of age .
that means i can just put an intuitive human model on a software and make the software more friendly .
so , of course , the question is , what is the most intuitive thing to do of human beings and now i &apos;ve been saying it .
this is what &apos;s called the &quot; model model . &quot;
it uses each of us and ozone is an acronym , and it stands for legitimate , selective , transaction .
it makes all of you all the time , but it makes it unconsciously , and it &apos;s kind of intuitive or partly intuitive .
the model is already reported in the womb and is an interesting , so it works at young and old , and it &apos;s used by us all the time , without most people knew that this model is there .
it &apos;s about 50 to seven thousand times a million times of the activity of the activity , so in sleep , you have noticed that it &apos;s less likely to be more frequent than the day .
now , i can use this mental model model , selecting , restorative transaction on a interaction system .
and through that kind of transmission , similar way of dealing with the metaphor of the desktop , now it &apos;s not a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a piece of output , a manual .
and this is on a higher basis of the user as the transmission of a classic metaphor , which is the disshelf .
and now , if i carry that , for example , in the way that i talk about overview , it selects as a selection , it &apos;s coming up to me , i can look at it in detail , and you know , it &apos;s going to be something that i can put on , and you can send it to someone and send it to you .
then i can transmit the whole thing .
i &apos;m trying to do this by an unprecedented .
in fact , everybody was eating cake .
again , i sort of interact with the object , again , zoom out , zoom in .
i get the whole point of view now , can now filter and say , show me , show me all about chocolate .
and once upon a time , an interface , which is more intuitive and very much more natural .
because that i can grab the things like the bits , can touch and touch them to me , is much more natural than if about hierarchically organized websites or other mechanisms to make these things available .
imagination is more futuriter vibrations , and with this sentence , i &apos;d like to close , a and again , to give a clue , even designers to think differently , and in this sense thank you very much for your attention and please .
i want to help you with a particular aspect of curiosity .
the first , if you &apos;re going to be a child , as a baby , is that you &apos;re going to take care of something that you have , right ? and if your parents allowed you to play more or less in the pottery , the more , the more , kind of , your curiosity is broken .
and the curiosity does not learn .
that &apos;s why all of you who are here are and curious , in fact , people who have a property that you can &apos;t learn .
i &apos;m now about making this whole environmental discussion , the world set , four hundred years of clubous colliclub , in quality .
and there &apos;s a central point .
and it depends on phosphorus .
give a gipee a chance .
every day they give you a scale of scale , about two grams of phosphorus , and every day you have to pick two grams of phosphorus .
otherwise you can &apos;t have teeth .
you can &apos;t store energy .
you can &apos;t have bone .
we could only glive as a species of the ocean .
if we actually don &apos;t pick phosphorus and insist .
so , amazingly , it &apos;s so that we &apos;re dealing with something , which is actually self-comprehensible , but not that way .
because everybody talks about energy , but nobody talks about the phosphorus problem .
the phosphorus problem is much more critical .
we depend on two countries .
we only have two years of phosphorus , and we &apos;re now going to have a lot more uranium in the world in the world than it &apos;s used in all nuclear plants .
in the last 20 years alone , five thousand tons of uron are spread on our fields in germany .
and that &apos;s what we take .
it &apos;s leukemia in children .
and we think we would protect the environment if we &apos;re a little less harmful .
so , for example , the environment , get less car .
htz the environment , make less waste .
high the environment , we need less energy .
but this isn &apos;t protection .
that &apos;s how i would say to your kid , just three times instead of five times .
that &apos;s just a little less destruction .
if we think about it from the mige to bathe baz , our whole earth will sooner or later .
that &apos;s about thinking about the mexican one .
and the most important thing is to look at the soil as the first first .
in the soil , over six percent of the carbon is saved .
right now , we &apos;re building corn and losing between 11 and 30 kilograms of 30 tons per hectd , or on top of the mountain .
that means we &apos;re losing about five and a half times more than new .
we can naturally look at the garbage problem .
and it &apos;s all packaging .
in open-stream , for example , at the orphanage , 20 percent of the garbage waste are wind .
and because we &apos;re getting older , the wind will get bigger .
it &apos;s kind of like all of you in the suburbs .
yes ?
a baby takes about six and a half strokes .
we could reduce that , of course , 10 percent , but what does that do ?
this will be balanced in china in a second .
this is completely trivial .
so the question is , how do we deal with these winds ?
here &apos;s one of the proof that men are not a pigs .
i want to tell you .
because the phosphorus will be unleashed in the pigs over the far term .
people over the urine .
yeah .
so men can &apos;t be pigs .
because that &apos;s the case , right ?
traditionally , we think of environmental debate , we &apos;re too many in the world .
and if you go to the people , if you &apos;re talking to people , if you say that , that would be better , you &apos;re not going to be there , you &apos;re more courageous and hostile .
and so someone like al gore says , one of our big heroes , there &apos;s nothing more important than stabilize human population .
in israel , you say when you save a living , save the earth .
here it says , the more you turn around , the better .
yeah .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
if you look at the ants , the color of the ants on earth , then the ants weigh about four more than we humans .
i could also take termites , but in the u.s. nobody like termites , in so far , even though they &apos;re vegetarian .
that means the ants weigh much more than we are .
and because they work a lot harder than we do , and because they live only three to six months , they live in their weight , in the energy use something 30 billion people .
that means we &apos;re not too many , we &apos;re too stupid , right ?
and where you &apos;re going to see how far we really wanted to get to what we really wanted to do , and how sad we are , that we are at all on earth , you can see that , for example , there is a program that &apos;s going to be a program , right ?
you can only be carbon neutral if you don &apos;t exist , yes ?
the only chance .
have you seen a click tree ?
yes ?
one ?
that means our whole intelligence means that we want to be a trees , right ?
yes ?
no tree is carbon neutral .
luckily not , yes ?
there &apos;s no exaggeration of the trees .
there are still six and a half billion trees alone .
have you heard about overpopulation problems from trees ?
that means all of our intelligence means that we want to be a trees .
and where you see , even with something like demeter , the largest bio-- it doesn &apos;t allow us to go back to our own metabolic products .
every year we lose three million tons of phosphorus that really would have to go back in circular .
and we &apos;re too many .
alone .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re feeling so guilty about the earth that we say , there &apos;s no organic structure , no organic , no , of course , no of all , that our own selves will go back .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
we &apos;re too many .
it &apos;s safe to be less harmful , which is oil consumption .
but where are we useful ?
we &apos;re trying to minimize our ecological footprint , but it &apos;s about having a big footprint that &apos;s useful .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but if it &apos;s about the environment , it &apos;s the highest , yes ?
nullemissions , yes ?
you can only have nullemissions if you &apos;re not there .
even if they shoot now , they would have emissions .
so you can &apos;t solve that .
we can do it differently .
we can pull our nutrients back .
we &apos;re in brazil agriculture in which we extract nutrients back .
in fact , we can get food back to this kind of food in agriculture .
we &apos;re doing this in china , for example , where we &apos;re taking off the bottom of it .
in china , one of them is a retroabopf today , like , yes ?
and in our western world , we were always too stupid to bring back our nutrients .
it &apos;s called the entire western civilizace story that the city has always taken , but the farmers never gave back .
so , the cities had to grow more and more , because the farmers in the cities had to go and keep the cities away .
so all of the western rich ones are always expanding , until they &apos;re not getting the infrastructure anymore and they &apos;re implollous .
yes ?
in china , it was different .
you &apos;ve been able to get a fralos civilization over five to five years because you &apos;ve always been able to bring the nutrients back .
even today , if you &apos;re invited to eat in china , you would expect to eat until you &apos;re looking for the toilet .
because it &apos;s unfriendly to go and increase the nutrients .
you &apos;ve got them to be invited to eat it , not for nutrient theft .
that means you can see on the internet , how you can extract nutrients back .
this is actually a beautiful thing , if you do that , so agriculture makes , biogas , on a hectcro country with five people in favelas , in order to make a farmer about a hundred and a half thousand dollars , and the plant and the vegetables and the fish and the fish .
and the great thing about this is that the crime rate in the favelas around nine-percent .
so we don &apos;t have to control people to be very poor .
we can support them to be good .
that &apos;s natural agriculture , of course , but the plants carry themselves .
the byproduct is clean water .
and they &apos;re designed by the design that a farmer can just put them in .
that means the crime rates go back .
and none of these facilities , we &apos;ve built over a hundred fifths now in the last 20 years , none of these facilities ever have ever been sucked .
you could easily throw a liter of supercroil , and then the plant would be ruined over years .
don &apos;t find it .
that means we don &apos;t have to control people to be very poor .
we can support them to be good .
that means we have to get phosphorus back .
and by the way , if you want to do something out of it , you write up , in germany , the best way to create all of the controls is that in france .
unfortunately , not in open stream , but maybe you can help the frankdest .
because the afghan plant could go back to phosphorus .
and it has to go back .
we see that that phosphorus is really critical .
and we see that it works .
we &apos;ve been using it for three years now .
the dutch government has explained , they will be the first country in the world , which is regaining phosphorus .
but we need the overall .
you know , there are two countries that control almost seven percent of the phosphorus in the world .
there &apos;s opec a bunch of bosses .
these are six countries who control four percent of the oil supplies .
and the oil will be able to replace through other kinds of energy .
but the phosphorus will not replace you .
that &apos;s not about making the existing a little bit less bad , but it &apos;s about making something right .
and it &apos;s particularly first to ask what the right thing is .
it &apos;s about efficiency , it &apos;s not about efficiency .
in holland , of course , you understand it easier because in holland , the country is built on flowers .
yes ?
imagine if , for example , your wife &apos;s sad , if you &apos;ve been frustrated , and you come with 50 roses .
totally inefficient .
but anyway , yes ?
or take a livy pen .
a woman in germany eats about six pies during her lifetime .
.
this is not not exactly right not exactly right , because because we don &apos;t know how much angry it is .
but one lip pen , even at that lighting , i can tell you , is completely inefficient , but very effective , right ?
everything that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
that &apos;s not the resource efficiency , but efficiency .
to ask , what is the right thing ?
not to burn a little bit better , and to put it down with it , and then lose it and lose it all the materials for cycles , but first of all , how do you draw circular ?
imagine mozart .
yes ?
if i invite you to the dinner and say , yes , there &apos;s a pill with open taste taste and a glass of water .
wonderful , yes ?
that &apos;s efficient .
everything that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
if you fall in love with somebody , efficient ?
yes ?
that means everything that counts in life is not about saving , to avoid .
the environmental debate .
we tell people , oh yes , you don &apos;t have an environmental consciousness in the south .
no , it &apos;s just the right thing , yes ?
in every place where you throw away from , yes , you can make life again .
but the wrong things .
if you throw away the wrong things , you have a problem .
as we think about north .
there &apos;s every single footprint there .
if you run , yeah , everybody breaks down the floor .
because the soil is going to die , the mosses die and the wind and the water disappears away .
but if you &apos;re in italy , every foot means that the water is staying in the meadow .
so , it &apos;s about making a big footprint , which is going to be a wetlands .
not school management .
we &apos;re in germany .
yes ?
but when i ask them , how about their wife ?
so what do you say ?
sustainable .
then i say , &quot; well , sorry . &quot;
that &apos;s the minimum .
so not saving , keep it , avoid .
every waste is nutritive .
and it &apos;s a lust , if you look in italy , like the people in the high bow so they get out of the car .
because you know , this is a fun process .
it &apos;s self-four-behavior , right ?
you can show , i was there .
but with the right design , please .
so , for example , we developed an ice billboard that &apos;s in space temperature .
they can kick out where they go and they stand .
in two hours , they &apos;re moving everywhere .
and it contains seeds of rare plants so that they go through the stream to biodiversity .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
so there are two circular cycles .
it &apos;s not all natural , of course .
a television or a washing machine , you just use them , they don &apos;t use them .
just the things that are willing to do , like glods , like the brall , like the writers , they have to be like they &apos;re going into biological systems .
things that are only used are going into technical systems .
but today we just talk about the biological systems .
yes ?
for example , the sneaker , yes ?
it &apos;s very direct advertising , and it &apos;s not for the company of puma , but that they &apos;re now helping this company to make these products successful .
because we don &apos;t do the things more freely .
yes ?
so , if i invite you to the food and say that &apos;s free , it doesn &apos;t help you .
no , we rely on what &apos;s inside .
positive .
so not like detox .
not toxic .
it &apos;s all in this is useful .
these are the first shoes that you can put on the footing of the pedestrian light and get the rubber into biocircular , yes ?
all of it is compatible .
and when it comes to us , of course , we work for adidas , for nike , for hennes and fragmented and the whole textile industry .
and that &apos;s half of all the water problems in the world that are caused by the textile industry .
that &apos;s why they help , ask questions about the people .
hey , puma , are you really serious ?
because they have already changed twice the precursor .
and i &apos;m not sure if you really remain there .
so , help me a little bit .
but it goes .
yeah .
that &apos;s what &apos;s been demonstrated right now .
this is .
we can do things like this , and if you get rid of it , if you get a broken , you can go into biological circular .
technical iterators are the same .
there is a direct decline system for this .
this is the first green backpack , which is actually done in the circulation .
and so , in every store , you can get things back .
if you come to that , yes ?
do you remember the windmill ?
now , that &apos;s the waste .
it &apos;s all around the wind , almost .
in the countries where people are getting to money .
there we go on the ground , but even in the landscape , yes ?
if we change the plastics so that it can go in biological systems , if we change the water storage , inside that they can just go back to cell uloine , then they can go back to a baby in israel , or in tunisia 100 trees .
yes ?
if you take these windulles , you cut them , pluze and the powder to plant trees .
so this is the baby carbon-positive for the whole life , already from beginning .
so , we don &apos;t need to be carbon-neutral , we can be sustainable .
it &apos;s sort of a crossfield print .
yeah , somehow .
yes ?
we can do that .
we can reinvent everything again .
i started an institute .
now , there &apos;s a lot of people working there , and they can all be engaged .
there is extra one , there &apos;s extra to craddle to craddle , where everyone can join .
so no longer save , discount , avoid , reduce , no school management , but smart waste .
does it make you curious ?
thank you .
the work of the interpretes .
music as a language .
in the description of my speech , i said that i was an interpreted , as a translator , so in english , in the english lexicon .
interpreting is a report of written notes in clinical music .
that as a translator , you don &apos;t just absorb word for word to the text in another language , but also the deeper meaning of words and worphusary , so that it has to get a meaningful translation , everyone knows that to do with foreign languages .
from the german to translate to english , knowledge can require more knowledge , once if you &apos;re about poetry or even about poetry .
but most alien , it &apos;s for salmon , what we do with our music language .
as an indication of a music piece , i first got the written notes .
you think that the doodle is written in the notes exactly everything he has imagined .
in fact , the notes are very vague and unaccurate .
these notes are about exactly the same or inaccurate , like a verbal , even seemingly accurate , description of a landscape .
because in this verbal landscape , the smell of the flowers is not to smell , the degree of the greens only to hear the satusles of the windmill not to feel .
that means the interpreacle must have this unpleasant piece of notes in another , which is to listen , physically , non-verbal music language .
today , i want to share with you what else i do otherwise , so animals , again , translate into a verbal language .
so a translation of translation .
so i put it in front of the whole german , because if i had to translate it again in english , it would be significant for me to translation the translation of translation .
so , the music works for me as much as the spoken language .
the note made the characters of the letter of a writing .
so it &apos;s not enough to learn to read notes and get the audio on the piano or the right place on a violin .
because that &apos;s only the letters that you &apos;ve learned to paint .
the meaning of the letters is you can only see if you can do the language .
so , for the learning process of music , music takes at least as long as the spoken language .
there &apos;s also some way that you can learn whether you &apos;re learning it for the sales , you can only understand passive or you can talk to the musical native language .
the work of the interpretes begins similar to how one theater report .
after the first time you &apos;ve chosen a piece of play to play , because you &apos;re excited about it , you start to find research for the beginning of the composition .
you collect information about the play in the secondary literature .
you read in the letters , tafts , notes , or whether it &apos;s words , thoughts of composers .
you study the works he used before and after .
you think about comparison .
the movement , writing it .
how and what did he find ?
how did his life share , like the society and the politics ?
this is all interested in me .
you think in this time , by looking at contemporary images , or read literature .
but over time , you also have a rich knowledge to know the composers that you &apos;re playing , and it seems to be easier to think of it in and feel it .
the translator is always going to be more and more like a friend that you live with .
his cause to write the play is becoming more and more and more of my personal concerns .
now , there &apos;s the notes all the other as a proper record of a composer , but just a framework , i now turn this framework , turn it back to a sense of purpose and meaning .
i &apos;ll say to my own words , what could be written between this framework .
i play what these sounds might mean .
now for me , for those composers , and what they now could mean for him today .
every note , every phrase gets a sense , because i feel it myself because it &apos;s from my right now .
it has to be in here for me , and now now , i can &apos;t convince my audience that this is my story .
it &apos;s always a very happy concert , if i can have the experience , the piece that i &apos;ve been doing so long in advance , how to experience .
as you &apos;ve seen a happy new day , even though with the same ritual of life , up to the same ritual , we get up to work , so i do the same piece of play again .
i &apos;ve become a day older , the seasons switch , my pulse goes slower at night , in a concert hall it takes longer to come back at home .
i &apos;m going to take the audience right or consciously consciously .
all of this affects me and all of that as well as my experience with the composition .
it &apos;s also wonderful when i stand with a duo partner on stage and we have the same wavelength .
and then the same thing is happening in a good way .
you get a new idea in and it &apos;s going to be answered to a reaction .
it &apos;s exciting , because then things that we didn &apos;t really have done , and what you can &apos;t demonstrate is that .
it &apos;s great fun to make this kind of music , and then you experience as the audience , how music communicates itself .
so every concert is another concert .
i &apos;ll never play more like that at the moment .
i can &apos;t play as in 20 years today .
and i &apos;m going to have more life experience than today , and that &apos;s why i &apos;m going to have a lot more of the music noise in the sound of music , emotion and emotion than today .
sure , i &apos;m going to have a couple of blobs of color out there , but that &apos;s a new one .
have a nice example of this .
it was on a piano meeting for music students in my beloved old teachers , professor jell ude , a known beethoven specialist , concert tpianist and slow professor of music professor here in clubs .
unfortunately , i was a lot too young , so he was very emedy when i finally started studying .
but i was fortunate enough to get him very early , with three and a half years , and i &apos;ve been to my classes at the time .
i was 17 when i went back to one of his courses , and i played the last one of the four bases from chopin , a piece of work .
he asked me what that balenad for me is .
this is such a distributed part .
and in my youth , i said , you know .
he and he said , &quot; so , right ?
that has to be the difference .
because for me , she means memory .
he was already over six .
well , with 17 , you just have dreams , but no significant memories .
i &apos;m going to play a piece of years today , and i &apos;ve always got it for me , even though not a single note has changed .
every time it &apos;s exciting , i keep reading something new .
an example of a very different area . monet has painted the stards .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but at different days , at different light .
he &apos;s translated through the sewers , as he saw it , as he saw in this moment at the moment .
his personal impressions of stards .
the x-serge interpretation of a piece is that kind .
now i &apos;m also older than the chopin with two-year-olds , when he wrote the piece .
he was only nine years old .
and it &apos;s important to me to look at the notes , even if i mean , you can memorize .
to hold up , right with the composers .
because the notes are the only connection to him .
especially when he died .
now , how do you start to speak the language of music ?
i said yes , you need about it as long as the spoken language .
often the music class is that you learn to read the notes .
you basically learn to read first before you just talk one word .
you learn to find the notes on the instrument on the instrument .
and if all of the finger in time and it &apos;s just like it &apos;s in the notes , then sound turns out , then sounds like music .
when this happens to error , students get the next difficult piece .
over interpretation is hardly spoken in the early classroom .
all right , there it is in front of presto , that &apos;s a fast piece .
lento , slow .
and it turns out , and b and b , etc .
you know the most here .
but even if you put it on , it &apos;s still a bit of technical .
and it &apos;s still not an interpretation .
i wonder .
i wonder you often eat something very fundamental .
because , in order to make music on the instrument , your musical music is supposed to be there before .
that &apos;s the singing .
a child who didn &apos;t learn the singing because it didn &apos;t lead to the parents , it won &apos;t do it .
that &apos;s like learning learning .
it &apos;s necessary to have its own experiences and the idea of the music to make it go over another possibility , so it &apos;s an instrument to sound .
people who never have imagined , so they never felt very close to their own body as it is to form a sound .
a phrase with his own breath .
the music force is the extension of our bodies .
our vocal boards to sing , our hands and feet to dance .
so the heads of the piano are the sequel of my fingers .
the melody comes from the face and the rhythm from the dance .
the lonellation processor nowadays is not restricted to music .
you don &apos;t need to make yourself music even if it becomes boring .
no more need to whistle , or sing .
every one of your music is going to run plate , if you &apos;re always blased from the outside with music .
sure , there are some among you who say , yes , but what do you do when i can &apos;t sing ?
the question i ask you can &apos;t sing , a , because they believe they can &apos;t sing ?
or b , because they didn &apos;t learn to sing ?
in both of them , it &apos;s not too late to start to figure out if they can &apos;t do it , or learn how to do these little muscles that put the vocal chords , right .
you can train that .
or c , because you put it on them , they &apos;re uncomfortable .
and i wonder , how do i care about this diagnosis ?
have you been given a second -- or third-opinion , how do you say it today ?
or d , you don &apos;t like any music and you want to have nix to do that too .
but what i would say , though , because music is a beautiful , communication thing .
but maybe you can still agree with it .
well , you can see , all of the cases have to be an unpleasant candidate .
but please don &apos;t say , i don &apos;t understand the classical music .
i can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s good or bad .
i told you , but sure , you can tell if it &apos;s like you or not .
because i don &apos;t think it says , somebody , i don &apos;t know if i can &apos;t cook it .
so , they don &apos;t pay for food , just because they can &apos;t cook .
so they don &apos;t have to rely on classical music , because they don &apos;t play an instrument .
listen to it , and tell you if it tastes or not .
whether the music is too sweet or too sweet .
tell that what they feel .
with time , you also get to spray and you want to have more spices there , or taste a difference .
why am i asking for my audience that it can also be active ?
because the music is a language and a language is to communicate there .
a piece of artwork you never look at has no force to work .
the food , which was cooked by a chef or a chef , has got to be eaten , and not just looked at recipes or recipes .
so please listen when a music is played .
it &apos;s not just a nice sound pete .
if in an environment , where the adults are doing music , or at least moral music , a child grows up , then it &apos;s very easy to ask for a music teacher .
can you play it in blue ?
and the kid is playing after a memorial , instead of a red flower , a blue flower .
and this sounds very different than before .
that was then the first beginning of a piece of musical expression .
so the first step to a interpretation .
and what happens when you play a piece today that was originally written a hundred and a half hundred years ago ?
now , the instruments evolved .
there was no piano at all when i was an instrument .
it wasn &apos;t invented yet .
i think the stream would have been excited if it had the sound of the modern livions of modern livimore today .
i can now have the sound of sound that has the stream to sound on the modern wing , which is a baroangular cemx cemx .
by beethoven , you know that he heard more than he had ever had before .
today , a modern orchestra in the situation is able to play everything that &apos;s an orchestra in the back of the day .
that &apos;s why composers rely on us to reinvent the pieces again .
so they &apos;re going to listen to what they &apos;ve been thinking about in the spirit .
and also , what you would think of today in the spirit .
or what i &apos;m thinking about today , because what you might have thought .
thank you .
you know what envy is ?
have you ever been envy ?
and how did that feel ?
suck .
i have a friend driving a passerati .
when i come , with my little v v spades and i &apos;m wrong , this feeling of feeling .
i drew something through the head .
i say , &quot; well , what do you need ? &quot;
that &apos;s the first year for the first year of his value .
and at all , you work a lot less than i do .
why do i afford to buy little car ?
and then immediately , i immediately think that &apos;s uneasy .
it &apos;s against justice .
and as i say the word justice , this unpleasant feeling is gone .
our organism has invented a great way of making such outrageous feelings like envy just to disappear .
you can also try this with words like revenge or profit or something like that .
i want to talk to you today about this mechanism , or get something to you , which is probably familiar with you .
the mechanism comes from lying .
but don &apos;t think of the lie , as you might have heard , if people say , nobody has the idea to build a wall .
and then rocks up , so he &apos;ll tell you the picture .
on a lie like this , you see the liars don &apos;t believe what he says .
it makes it easy to verify that it &apos;s very different in the sense .
he &apos;s just deceiving her and not himself .
no , the lie i &apos;m talking about is that you deceive yourself .
you need this lie to get a life lie to get a self-delusion .
you can get a little bit less easy , yes , you can check out or get to the lift .
you need time .
from this time , an anecdote is talking to you perhaps .
the spanish painter , picasso once has a woman portrait .
this woman , after then , turned out to be the portrait of her .
picasso answered , just wait .
it &apos;s getting more like that .
at this point , when you laugh , you realize how important this lie is and how much time you need to do something about what artists do very well .
because artists have a functional relationship to lying .
the artist tells you something , and especially this lady , what you don &apos;t see when you just look in the mirror .
the artist tells you something like this in a portrait that you &apos;re only going to be familiar with when you look at this piece of artwork .
and then this unpleasant feeling , it may not seem to you , and it &apos;s going to be more like that .
here you have this mechanism where we can use the lie as a great invention to protect our lives .
and not just in the art , even in the folk , in the mythology , in stories , it enters it .
you may know this idea of the lady who looked at each morning in the mirror and asked him who is the most beautiful in the country ?
one day , this mirror says , yes , there &apos;s a beautiful one .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
and you also know how much hostility from this true , even the mirror can &apos;t lie , from this true bias .
but we should just make ourselves feel like you can &apos;t tell a woman that there &apos;s a more beautiful somewhere else .
this is what we need to understand what we &apos;re seeing , and over the horizon .
we need this feature that holds us to the deception , without that we can &apos;t keep ourselves alive .
we don &apos;t just have art in the arts , in charity , but also in science such as great lies .
and there &apos;s this story from the lady of the bischofs .
she heard about this book by charles darwin , the origin of the species and the insurgency of man .
the man from the monkey comes off , and , yes , there would be a common ancestor at least between people and monkeys .
and then she ran her to her husband , and she said , well , that &apos;s not true , which charles da writes .
the man should come off from the monkey or have a shared ancestor .
no , no , it &apos;s not .
and if it &apos;s true , then we have to prevent that people will get knowledge of it .
why do we have to prevent that people know about something that is true ?
because we cannot live this life lie .
because we have this self-deception , this sense of being great , full of the highest creatures , not from one of these events , not from such a kind of an organism , which is still more inclusive to us .
so , we can &apos;t get rid of these things .
we need to prevent that people will get knowledge of things , especially when they &apos;re true .
so you can see how slowly this mechanism evolves , and what the traces look like , the things that go to something else than on this great picture of ourselves , i want to give you another story .
a particularly beautiful story , as i mean .
my wife told me it .
she came from school one day , she &apos;s a teacher , and she told a student .
an autistic student .
it likes to be particularly like it , because he &apos;s got a propenance to open up .
and she asked him , what are your hobies ?
and he says , well , i &apos;m at the fire department .
and because i &apos;m at the fire department , i &apos;m interested in parotechnical things .
yes , you &apos;re going to feel it when you &apos;re cold at this point . right ?
i told my wife , whenever a human being in a moral rights is used , because we should try and replace it through the wort even though .
do it once and then experience the sentence .
although i &apos;m at the fire department , i &apos;m interested in parotechnical things .
they feel that this is the real truth behind the bottom .
this is a little bub that &apos;s not interested in fire .
it &apos;s interested in the fire .
but there is no suggestion where we can look at where you &apos;re learning how to make fire .
there &apos;s only the second best , the fire department .
there he was .
and , you know , you &apos;re not telling his teacher that you &apos;d like to put pure homes somewhere , and i &apos;m excited when the fire goes up .
no , it just looks much better if we show that we &apos;re in charge of getting the risks , the other one , if you just put fire .
here you have this little mechanism .
these trade-offs that the inside of the bub is already known that he &apos;s actually related to the fire , but that he can &apos;t say it loud .
here you have this censor between the unconscious and the conscious , which instantly jumps up , without that you can do something about it , and the things that you know that you can look like , that they can look very much better for you and others .
so that &apos;s just the same words that we &apos;re using to use in the language of politically correct speech .
we actually know that something else is the case .
but we know that when we talk to that , social technologies are very sensitive .
we can &apos;t just do that .
it &apos;s impossible to do things like this in a society that should work .
i want to show you now what we found in my institute .
after what logic is that deception , this self-deception , the willingness to be a different reality than the ones we actually have in the unconscious , you know , to spread out .
i want to share with you two , maybe three examples .
the first example is ahead of what many of you know and some of you are aware of , very few of them .
i mean the soul .
what &apos;s the soul ?
the soul is kind of a mental , says about leibniz .
it &apos;s something that &apos;s not clear from stop , materiic nature .
and when you have people who are a solid belief , they have a soul , or you can also say that they have been made from the soul to life , and then they have that kind of thing that the soul would be about as if the soul are so kind of an intellectual frame of the earth , it &apos;s not just a matter of matter .
and now , from this soul , you think that somehow in this cloudy nature , in this room nature , it &apos;s called anima in the latin , the air floor .
and then when this windhall is about the people , then it &apos;s filled with it , with the spirit , with nature that can only live with the soul .
and then he can walk away .
that &apos;s the idea of how the soul works .
so it &apos;s supposed to come from the outside to people .
so we should be able to perceive them as something that should be true for our lives .
and if you have this premise , you understand the logic that we can experience of happiness through a lie to improve our world .
because now you can apply a three-sentence .
three , you know , from school .
this is now a three-sentence which describes logic .
and by the way , this is the hardest part in my talk .
here you need some logic , but also the willingness to lie .
and that &apos;s how to lie that they can easily apply this logic .
in this three-sentence sentence , three sentences .
the first sentence is , cloning , there &apos;s no soul .
so the second phrase is , if it &apos;s right , it has no soul .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
i put it in particular .
a third set , which immediately ends up with people who have strong sense of a soul .
they say who doesn &apos;t have a soul , that &apos;s dead and can &apos;t say anything .
and here you feel it .
here &apos;s the logic in this , yes , in this embarrassing talk to expression .
you see it immediately .
the first two sentences , they &apos;re logical .
because i can say anything .
the logic doesn &apos;t make any answers about reality .
i can say the canary is a man .
and if i have right , the canary is a man .
if i didn &apos;t right , the canary is no man .
the logic doesn &apos;t make any point about what &apos;s true .
i can say everything .
but critically , if i have right , it &apos;s true .
so if silent says , there &apos;s no soul .
second , if he &apos;s right , he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
these things are logical .
and now our fake consciousness feels instantly , you can do something about it .
it &apos;s a third sentence , which has nothing to do with the first two sentences , and that is as if the opposite of the first sentence has been proven and predicted .
because actually , we have to prove whether there &apos;s the soul or not .
but with that logic that &apos;s just using it , that two sentences are logical , and a third one that looks like it would have something to do with it , we can save our lives .
so , we do as if it &apos;s actually impossible to be able to live without a soul .
and we &apos;re very happy about it .
we can continue these things to different examples .
in the present moment , we have a very modern example of the day that &apos;s going to fill up the daily newspapers .
in this case , you have to have another philosophical subject , a permanent one from philosophy .
that has to do with it that we go back to the four-square century .
there was a scholars called johannes buridanus , and after that , the buridanan esel is named .
the buridanan esel is an esel who is out of nature .
it &apos;s not that soul .
this is a natural thing .
and if you place the exact right in the middle between two and a half , he &apos;s hungry .
because he doesn &apos;t know what &apos;s going to do first .
so he &apos;s right in the middle .
that &apos;s how nature works .
same forces with countercurrent prepositions solve each other .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
just when you take another example , so if you &apos;re going to get a lot of it , it doesn &apos;t need any reason , and it doesn &apos;t matter .
automatically , he goes to the right thought .
so if you have this idea that you &apos;re kind of driven in nature , it &apos;s going to be shaped by the larger pile that will deliver instantly , then you also have the feeling that there must be something like free will .
and if we &apos;re here in frankya at the main , i remember the max institute institute for brain research .
there &apos;s a scholars who &apos;s called &quot; wolf , &quot; and by him , sometimes you say , wolf , it &apos;s not freedom .
now , again , we can make the second sentence , and we can say , if wolf is right , it doesn &apos;t have any freedom .
these sentences are absolutely logical and accurate .
and what we can see now in the dayday newspaper that you can find in this third sentence .
it looks like this , who doesn &apos;t have any freedom of freedom , can &apos;t be moved for his actions and claims , and he &apos;s so addicted to the responsibility .
again , you have it again .
in fact , you should have to prove if there &apos;s something like willor freedom .
but the logic of deception allows us to do it as if the first sentence of pre-coming is wrong , when you have to think of the opposite without evidence .
and now you can just , if you want to do something , if you want to test anything , and especially if you want to make people happy , the courage to practice the lie .
so , for example , practice that , if you &apos;re going to meet a man that you can say , there &apos;s no predicted .
and please don &apos;t use the german word for previous , called prophet .
you can &apos;t call that , that would be a little bit politically correct .
say , there &apos;s no previous one .
immediately , you &apos;re going to have one , for granted , for granted , that you can &apos;t prove .
and already you have a problem .
because while you &apos;re busy , you can &apos;t prove that you can &apos;t prove that there &apos;s no previous one , the man is very happy .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he agreed .
because he had put it on a ride that he doesn &apos;t hang on himself .
because actually , this man is not interested in evidence .
he &apos;s just interested in holding himself out of the need to have to prove that there is before .
so , in the kind of transition of evidence , you &apos;re experiencing the greatest uncertainty of lying .
and once again , if you have an opportunity to feel these three sentence in other people , they do it , because they &apos;re going to make other happy when they don &apos;t remember their self-lying .
thank you for your attention .
yeah , good afternoon .
i &apos;ve spent lilly asked if i could mention it .
she &apos;s one of the most popular things here , and she asked me if i wanted to give a talk here and give me my idea .
i &apos;ve got to say , you &apos;ve got it , you know , it &apos;s got hard to talk about my idea .
and i may imagine my project project that i &apos;m trying to imagine you .
but , of course , it &apos;s the sum , lots of ideas .
i &apos;m probably , you know , the two girls still there , i &apos;m probably standing on the generation for this bad oko image , because i &apos;ve started to study nine and a half thousand pounds of suffering in carlsth , technical college , today , i think , that i think kit .
and then , in the middle of the 20th years , i went to berlin because i wanted to make renewable energy , and i didn &apos;t have it .
there was the core research kit .
they were all at the time called the jewish kfa .
now , the name today .
because a good engineer has built either great cars or nuclear power plants .
but this kind of doofes like solar pendulum , which is kind of a hundred watts out of the mountain , which was a toy .
and in berlin , there was a crazy engineering tool .
i am grateful to the prime minister that he had revised the word again because after the masoncase , you couldn &apos;t use the word anymore because everything was bad .
but in the 1990s , it wasn &apos;t like that .
there was the fact that there was self-organized alternative conditions , and one of them was sitting in the courtyyard , where you thought the evil .
the place of terrorist surgery , but that was called &quot; sponoonics and made wind and solar energy , and i started in the middle of the 20th century .
and yes , a lot of what was said today , i &apos;m very , very touched by many , many beautiful expressions that i &apos;ve lived through .
i &apos;ve been working in the collective community that was grassroots .
we were 20 people .
if one didn &apos;t say , this was the capopwash , which has an entirely sealed , and i &apos;ve been able to do it for 10 years , if i &apos;ve actually been doing my great engineering study , because all the colleagues of my father would have kept him out of the window .
it &apos;s busy .
and that was really , really , really , really , very , very , and then you get into this stage , just appeared to get a picture on where i &apos;ve asked for 10 years to have a thousand , and it &apos;s really the great one .
and i went out until six and a half , and then we got together with friends of the company , which then came together with the spin-off with the spin-off of the world .
a giant statement , which is , of course , we have the problem of a growing company and then we have two-and-a-half six , a small group , decided that we can start again and go back to the next topic of the future , and that is , again , that people will say what &apos;s going to happen , we &apos;re going to talk about it , that &apos;s what &apos;s going on , we &apos;re going to talk about it .
and i brought to you a project that i want to introduce you to now .
and the title of the presentation was , yes , how to get 100 percent renewable .
and we just started to wonder with a relatively simple crazy story , where you could use a memory of memory today .
on this island , this is the island graciosa on the azrus .
yes , these are the data .
there are four and a half thousand people .
they have a renewable energy share of five-ten percent today .
and the question is , why don &apos;t you ?
it &apos;s just not technological .
if you build more wind , the system starts to fail .
so i &apos;m always telling the politicians when they &apos;re in berlin-adlerich of our facility .
and they always say , why ?
we already have 20 percent in germany .
i can &apos;t be a problem at all .
but not , we have seven percent in europe , and our net is physical , the european system .
if we had 20 percent in europe , we &apos;ve had the same problems that people have on this island .
the question was just , there was two thousand in 2006 , and they started the first contact with the island .
as big as it would have to be a battery , so you have to be an island on 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 , maybe even seventh percent renewable .
and yes , i &apos;m going to go back again .
the conventional system looks like this .
by the way , a hundred gigawatts of electric performance will be built on the inside of the world .
that &apos;s the performance of a hundred nuclear power plants , because this is all very quick everywhere .
the energy hunger in the world is going to take place with this el , because you don &apos;t need permission .
that &apos;s quick .
you think of it as a box .
and then it looks like this .
in the run of three of these , two will always wait .
yes , this is what one looks like at the bottom .
we also have very precise data .
and the wind plant , or the solar facility , or whatever it is , is a brick system system , a system that can eat only in small quantities here .
our goal was just to say , okay .
and the one that &apos;s going to turn up , and the wind , the sun , is going to make the load that they can make the wider percentage .
and if you want to go about 20 , 30 percent renewable energy , energy per year , not the performance at the moment , you have to turn off the one .
that &apos;s what you have to do for the moment that renewables can take care of the whole net .
you can , of course , only if you &apos;re put in some way in some way .
this one has no one in the world .
there &apos;s this little style in the little box , so you can also train your shaves over a little bit of activity .
people always ask me , what do they do in adhlearn ?
that &apos;s already .
but if you want to have multiple of these interactions together , and you want to build the web , it becomes extremely complicated .
and our goal was , we wanted to go to seventh to ninety percent renewable , and then this is the rest of the last 10 , 20 percent renewable , the last 10 , 20 percent renewable , which will become very , very expensive , and it &apos;s not going to work that you will do it from batteries .
it &apos;s going to be a minister of energy , which then , hydrogen , methane , power to gas , you know , that will be .
you have to go to a seasonal memory and winter summer and not just night .
we just wanted to know what is because with a normal , stbling electrochemical battery .
how far do you get there ?
and they did a whole lot of simulation .
and wind and sun and the sun simulates and came to the conclusion , a very exciting result , that you need to have a middle of the conventional system that takes about 50 cents a kilowatt-hour hour .
these were the very first calculations six years ago .
and then we said , okay .
it &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
we &apos;re cheaper like the steriid system , when the kin price rises five percent a year .
and then we started negotiating the goldilocks .
what would all be done ?
with investors , i &apos;ve been looking for new transducer .
we were only five people at the time trying to rebuild the society .
and here &apos;s the picture .
the brafist is sort of the conventional system , the green is our system .
that our system also has an escape , is that we &apos;re still doing 20 percent with this , and also a price increase on the other things .
and the collections of hype that the current business company on the island has meant to find out great .
we also want to support , but we don &apos;t think you can solve the technical problem .
and that &apos;s why we decided to build a hall in berlin where we can sort of make the electric record in the scale of the island in three ways .
that means we first went to find the largest battery in the world .
here she is .
it comes from asia , in the case of japan .
and funny , she &apos;s in the &apos; 70s at bbc crew , at the home of her day , today , and she was licensed to the japanese .
you can see , it &apos;s a very , very large battery .
she has a megaph , and she can take six hours of this performance and that &apos;s the battery that we have sort of simulated .
and then they set up .
we also have one of these styro-hype in the same size , as it says there is , in the hall , to actually bring the full dynamic behavior from this grid , so in the hall , this is the great battery that we can simulate the web here .
over here , we &apos;re going to simulate the whole communication system , the areas of the wires , to sort of make the vibrational behavior in the net .
and here you can see the whole thing again .
we can turn two hundred kilowatts of rice into the net .
here we see this again , again , again , again , the whole , individual , single .
and what we &apos;ve done since two and a half thousand was the hall , until day two thousand , almost everything that was here between the individual system of electronics , in software , we did .
so we &apos;re not a flower maker , but we define ourselves as a company that is only between the theme of battery and the issue , and everything in between .
you have to , of course , to communicate the battery , you can also communicate into the net , and that &apos;s very complicated .
the nice thing about this is that , in this island , you can basically take this all the way forward to problems that we get , if we want to increase our share of renewables .
so this whole discussion , as is going on right now , and it moves , energy turn , how to go to the island for example , for example , for five to 30 percent , so we cut the wind and the sun .
now , natural light is a smart grid .
so smart grid , a huge topic everywhere .
we can start to integrate an electric mobility on the island , and let &apos;s ask , you know , you can manage the burden .
that means if you &apos;re in seventh percent renewable , you can &apos;t do it without storage .
you can get through smart grid , you can use nets , yes , you should be able to do that in any case , but you &apos;re never going to be able to get on memory .
and that &apos;s what the message is .
so many people come and look at this , because you can see what problems you get .
if we turn off this one , you don &apos;t really have these rounds of the mass that cause a certain inertia in the net .
and our european nerve network is basically just from louder mass of large power plants , where the wave is all around europe .
we &apos;re looking inside this net , and the 50 hertz , and when it &apos;s nine of the nine hertz of three-hertz , we &apos;re starting to do a couple of searches , then we &apos;re going back to a little bit .
that &apos;s the system .
and of course , this is incredibly adapted .
if you tear that down somewhere , it takes a long time .
the hirshhorn reserve has at least 10 seconds to keep the web stable .
and in time , they can respond again .
if you don &apos;t have that anymore , these roke mass , you have to replace that with power electronics and electrochemistry .
and we can switch on with this big battery , two milliseconds .
there you go , you know , the enormous speed of speed there .
and the message is now , we have to rely on these raw masses of mass if we sort of like our goals 20 , 20 , 20 , 20 , 30 , 30 percent , and so on , if we want to get rid of it at all .
then we have to break our nest-run capacity in the net .
i mean , must-run is just running power to keep the frequency .
yes , that &apos;s a huge debate right now , building from the coal power , because we don &apos;t do it , or gasturbines , because it &apos;s not .
and we &apos;re just trying to make sure that the capacity of the capacity , the must-run capacity , can break into the net as well .
now , fortunately , there &apos;s a whole bunch of studies now .
and to this purpose , people always come and look at our trial , especially our island test .
and yes , the discussion is always about the question of how far you can take a piece of future forward .
and many discussions that i had in the last six years were kind of like the discussion i had in the last 30 years .
it &apos;s not , you know , fine , child play , we &apos;ve never done anything .
we have 30 gigawatts today in germany .
this is premediary .
and i just go out of it that we have the same capacity to store the same capacity for electrochemical drugs all over the world .
very simply , it will come .
there &apos;s going to be a whole lot of disconsistentions , and there &apos;s arguments .
the nice thing is , i &apos;ve been in the last two years now that the scientists have come up with my side .
we &apos;ve now got over tens of millions of dollars , and we have about 10 million megawatt-battery right now to the german net .
this is going to happen next april .
so from that , you also realize that there &apos;s a change there , and it &apos;s only from this proposition to the idea of being 100 percent renewable .
and if you have a hundred percent renewable , it &apos;s like a teapot system .
so far in discussions , we &apos;re always trying to do this sort of hype , which is , you know , a little bit of a little net that has a little bit of your own , and nothing to do with it .
the question is , you know , if you make yourself completely independent from any of the fossil energy or ancient energy , that will be dricked out somewhere around the world , and then you &apos;re going to be an island .
then they just use what the sun and wind is there , where they live .
and this is a little bit of our vision of a quote energy , and i &apos;m grateful to cradle to cradle that they have said , solar energy .
and that &apos;s what we do , and inclose to the talk of prime , that you can be a collective , and use solar energy , here &apos;s a little bit together .
and yes , i want to just encourage you to be able to get a little bit crazy , and have a vision .
and you really have to stay pretty tough , but i think it &apos;s going to happen .
thank you .
when steve lopez , the los angeles is the los angeles times , one day in the middle of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , an african-american , sympathtic , rau , homeless , who played on a violin that was only two sacred .
many of you will know the story , because from steves about it later , it was a book that turned out to be with robert enney junior as steve lopez , as steve lopez , and the most promising career of the most promising career in the juillid of schizophrenia .
nathaniel left juilliard , suffered a nervous breakdown , and 30 years later he lived as a homeless on the streets of skid row in the center of los angeles .
i recommend to read all of you , read , or looking at the movie so that you can &apos;t understand the wonderful connectedness that happened between those two men , but also how the music was helped , and then how it was , when this chap was allowed to get the content , the alf of the street .
i met mr. adden in 2008 , two years ago in the walt disney tourhall .
he had just heard a snapshot of beethoven &apos;s first and fourth symphony , and came out of the stage to imagine me .
he was talking to a very thorny , and he was talking about vibrio ma and hillary clinton , and how the dodgers would never do it in the baseball world series , and that &apos;s all because of the tempan passage in the last sentence of beethoven &apos;s family .
we came to talk about music , and a few days later , i got an email in which nathaniel was interested in teaching me .
i &apos;ve got to say that nathaniel is a medical treatment , because he had already been treated with electric shocks and with hobaine and handhanders , a trauma that he had his whole life .
now , as a result , it &apos;s particularly vulnerable to these schizophrenics , and those are sometimes so bad , and he would walk away in the streets of skid row , always that horror and the implication of his own mind .
and in exactly such a lovely stage , nathaniel , when we started with our first curriculum in the walt disney hall hall , he had this insane flworn in his eyes and he was completely lost .
he talked about invisible heres and smoke and about how someone wanted to commit to sleep .
i was afraid , not mine , but i was afraid that i could lose him , that he could fall down into one of his states and that i could destroy his relationship to the head when i started talking about pitch boards and other exciting forms of didative gdacos .
so i just started playing .
i played the first sentence from beethoven &apos;s violinconcert concert .
and while i was playing , in nathania , i noticed that in nathania &apos;s eyes was a complete change .
it was when he was under the impact of a invisible doctor , a chemical response , whose catalyst was my game .
nathanian musan anger turned into understanding into a calm curiosity and incourage .
and as through a miracle , he took his violin and started to play a couple of excuses from violinconcert to play and asked me to play : mendelsson , siyicoccocski .
we started talking about music , started by bach , brams , katms , and all the other bs , from bartók to esa peons .
and i realized that he didn &apos;t just know an encyclopedia about music , but it also connected to her very close personal relationship .
he talked about her with a passion and an understanding that i could only know from my colleagues in the philippines of los angeles .
by playing music , and talking about music , it was out of this paranoid , confused man who was just moved through the streets of los angeles , an educated , educated , well-educated musician .
music is medicine . music changes us .
for nathaniel , music means seelidian health .
because the music allows him to put his thoughts and delusions with his imagination and creativity into something real .
and he turns out his agonizing conditions .
i understood that exactly this is the nature of art .
this is why we &apos;re making music : so we do something that is in all of us , deep inside , our emotions , through our artistic lens , through our creativity to reality .
and the reality of this approach is to all of us , and move , inspired and united .
what nathaniel andid , he brought it back to a community of friends .
the power force of music brought it back into a family of musicians who understood him , who recognized his talent , and he suggested him .
and i &apos;m always going to talk to nathaniel music , whether in the walt disney alley hall or in skde row , because he reminds me why i became a musician .
thank you .
bruno giussani : thank you very much . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play a little bit of play , which i &apos;m very excited about .
i hope you &apos;ll forgive me .
so i did a lot of fish in my life .
i only loved two .
this first , that was more like a passionate monkey .
it was a beautiful fish , well-motivated , good addiction , well-built , a trained on the menu .
what a fish .
even better , he was raised in aquakuldeen for the highest highest standards of sustainability .
so you could feel about selling it .
i had a relationship with this beauty about several months .
one day , the head of the company started and asked if i could carry in an event about the sustainability of the farm .
&quot; of course , i said .
here was a company that was trying to solve what &apos;s become this outrageous problem for our cooks . how do we keep fish on our menu ?
in the last 50 years , we &apos;ve fished the ocean as we signed forests .
it &apos;s hard to overrate destruction .
ninety percent of the big fish that we love , the tuna , the curds , the lax , the hard fish , they &apos;re collapsed .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
so , you know , it &apos;s going to be a nasty couulago , fishing , a part of our future .
a lot of arguments . fishing plants pollute the environment , most of them at least , and they &apos;re inefficient , we take tuna . a big disadvantage .
he &apos;s offered a food score from 15 to one .
that means 15 pounds of wild fish are required to get a pound tuna .
not very sustainable .
it doesn &apos;t taste very well .
so finally , there was a company trying to do it right .
i wanted to hire them .
on the day before the event , i called the ceo of public labor for the company .
let &apos;s call it .
&quot; don &apos;t see , &quot; i said , &quot; just to have the facts right , you &apos;re famous to build this way out in the sea , that you &apos;re not polluting the environment . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s true , &quot; he said . &quot; we &apos;re so close to the waste of our fish , not concentrated . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; we &apos;re basically a whole world .
that food score from the hallto one , he said .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
and three , great .
&quot; hexto one what ? what ? &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . put it on .
and at that evening , i was in bed , and i thought , what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so i called up the next day , just before the event , don &apos;t do it .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t you know what , for example , sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said he doesn &apos;t know . he &apos;ll be wondering .
well , i &apos;ve been writing with a few people in the company , and no one could give me a proper answer , until finally , with the gun biologists .
we also call him don .
&quot; don &apos;t see , &quot; i said , &quot; for example , what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some algae and some of the fish , and then he said , chicken pellets .
i said , &quot; chicken pellets ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , fethers , skin , skin flflles , dripping and feeding and feeding . &quot;
i said , &quot; how much percent is chicken ? &quot;
in the assumption of maybe two percent .
&quot; well , these are about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t look what &apos;s sustainable to feed chicken to fish ? &quot;
there was a long pause in the line and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken in the world . &quot;
i loved this fish .
no , not because i &apos;m passionate about it , and it &apos;s fair .
that &apos;s me even .
no , i &apos;ve actually dreamed of this fish , because , i swear to god , the fish after this conversation went to chicken .
this second fish , this is another kind of love story .
it &apos;s the romantic way , the way you learn to know your fish , you love the more .
i ate it first in a restaurant in southern spain .
a professional journalist had spoken for a long time of this fish .
it has somehow evolved .
he came up in the table with a bright , very smooth white color .
the chef had cooked him .
hold twice .
amazingly , he was still delicious .
who can make a fish taste so well after he was cooked ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
let &apos;s call him miguel . actually , he &apos;s called miguel .
and no , he didn &apos;t cook the fish , and he &apos;s not a chef , at least on the way they and i understand .
he &apos;s a biologist at raa la palma .
this is a fish in the southern western corner of spanish .
it &apos;s close to the coins of the river guadalr .
until in the &apos; 80s , the farm was in the hands of argentinians .
they raised meat on what was basically wetlands .
they did that by cutting the land off .
they built this complicated series of channels , and they lay out water from the land and out into the river .
well , they couldn &apos;t make that working , not economic .
and green was a catastrophe .
it took about 90 percent of the birds , which are a lot of birds .
and so in 1982 , a spanish company bought the country .
what did they do ?
they immediately have the flow of the water vice versa .
they &apos;ve literally laid out the lever .
instead of putting the water out , they used the channels to go back to the water .
they had the canals .
they created a 11,000 hectares of fish -- bark , sea , shrimp , aal -- and in the process , miguel and his company have the ecological destruction entirely .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like that .
you stare out on the horizon , which is a million miles away , and everything you see is curved channels and these density , lush march .
i wasn &apos;t a long time ago with miguel .
he &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts of charles darwin and a part of a crocodile .
okay ? so , there we were , and we fought through the wetlands and i ski , and i hop , maw up to my knees , and miguel keeps a success lecture .
here he is pulling a rare track .
now he mentioned the mineral needs of phytoplankton .
and here , here he is a pattern of bundthat reminds him of the manufacturing giraffe .
it turns out that miguel has spent the greatest part of his career in mikretroi national park in africa .
i asked him how to become such a fish expert .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish .
i &apos;m an expert for relationships . &quot;
and then he goes down into more of rare birds and algae and strange water plants .
and don &apos;t get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the biotic community , so in the way .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
and my head was delicious about this wounded piece of fish that i had at the precursor .
so i cut him . i said , &quot; miguel , how does it come so well ? &quot;
he showed the algae .
&quot; i know boy , the algae , the phytoplankton , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible .
but what eat your fish ?
how is the food judgment ? &quot;
now , he goes on to tell me that it &apos;s a rich system , that the fish eat what they would eat in the wild .
the vegetable biomass , the phytoplankton , the zooplankton , that &apos;s what the fish feed .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely self-novelty .
there &apos;s no food .
je from a farm that &apos;s not feeding their animals ?
later on the day i went on this site with miguel and i asked him , i said , &quot; for a place that seems to be , &quot; different than any farm i &apos;ve ever been , &quot; how do you measure success ? &quot;
in the moment , as if a movie director would have a stage change .
and we broke around the corner , and we sat down the most incredible sight , thousands and thousands of remixations , literally enough the eye .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at your cubs , pink .
they worse . &quot;
? i was completely confused .
i said , &quot; miguel , don &apos;t you eat your fish ? &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and fishing eggs .
well last year on this site , 600,000 birds were more than 250 different species .
it &apos;s today &apos;s largest and one of the most important private reserves in europe .
i said , &quot; miguel , does it not be a good bird that you want to go to a fish ? &quot;
he bathed his head , no .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building self-organization , not intense .
this is an environmental network .
the holthouse eat the shrimp .
the garneles eat the physical spaghetti .
so the more innovative the gut , the better the system . &quot;
okay , let &apos;s rethink this . a farm that feeds your animals , and a farm that measures your success to the health of your predators .
a fishing reserve , but also a bird reserve .
oh , and by the way , these flats would not even be there .
they breed in a city of 240 miles away where the ground prices are better for the nest maintenance nest maintenance .
every morning they fly 240 miles to the farm .
and every night they fly 240 miles .
they do that because they can follow the white line of the country &apos;s land .
seriously .
i imagined a kind of journey of penguins , so i looked at miguel .
i said , &quot; miguel , fly somewhere in the farm , and then go back to 240 miles on the night ?
do you do that for kids ? &quot;
he looked at me as if i had just taken a song from whitney houston .
he said , &quot; no . they do it because the food is better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my loved book , which was delicious , and i don &apos;t like fish skin . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it .
it &apos;s the end , the taste taste .
i almost never do it with it .
and yet , when i tried to put them in this restaurant in southern spain , they didn &apos;t break down to fish .
they liked sweet and in , as if you would take a bite from the ocean .
i mentioned this to miguel and he was nocking .
he said , &quot; the skin works like a sponge .
it &apos;s the last abad , before something in the body .
it &apos;s evolved over the evolution of evolution to be unlocked . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; but our water doesn &apos;t have an unlocked . &quot;
okay . a farm that feeds your fish . a farm that measures your success success success .
and then i realized , when he says , a farm that doesn &apos;t have an unpurifious , he gets enormous , because the water that comes through this farm is coming from the river .
it &apos;s a river that causes all of these things to come from these days , and these days , they tend to lead , chemical pollutants , disflow of pest .
and when it fought through the system , and this leaves is clean , as it &apos;s coming .
the system is so healthy , it cleans water .
so not just a farm that feeds their animals , not just a farm that measures their success on the health of their predators , but a farm that &apos;s literally a water supply facility , not just for those fish , but for you .
because when the water flows out , it goes down in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;m going to take it , and that &apos;s what you should do , because this love story , as romantic as romantic is also .
you might say that you &apos;re a recipe for the future good , whether we &apos;re talking about barsh or meat cattle .
what we need now is a radically new concept of agriculture , from one , in fact , taste good .
but for a lot of people , this is a little bit radical .
we &apos;re not a realistic , we enjoy . we &apos;re lover .
we love farmers . we love small family businesses . we &apos;re talking about regional food . we eat organic food .
and if you say that that &apos;s the things that are good at the future of good food , someone says , &quot; hey , hey , hey , i love pinching , but how will you feed the world ?
how will they feed the world ? &quot;
can i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like this question .
no , not because we already produce enough calories to feed the world more than just feeding .
one billion people are starving today .
one billion -- this is more than ever before -- due to cruca inequalities , not the total production .
well , i don &apos;t like this question because the logic of our food system has the last 50 years .
lower grain of plant predators , harmful fighters on monocultures , chemicals on the earth , chicken to fish , and the whole time has been asked , &quot; if we get more people cheaper to do this ? &quot;
this was the cause . it was the legal . it was the business plan of america .
we should call them what it is that it is , a industry in aberie , a industry , which is very fast in ecological capital .
this is not a industry , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
now , our cornchamber is threatened today , not due to the ground , but because of decreation resources .
not through the latest grands and tractor inventions , but through fruit land , not by pumps , but through fresh water , not by flocking , but by forests , but not by fishing boats and nets , by fishing boats .
you want to feed the world ?
let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that enable every community to feed themselves ?
to do that , don &apos;t look at the agricultural model for the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
capital , chemistry and machines are at top of it , and it has never created a good job for food .
instead , let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
this is what reaches on two billion years of labor experience .
look at miguel , farmers like miguel .
businesses that are not worlds for themselves , businesses that are reproducing , rather than need businesses , the doodle growing , rather than just intense , farmers who are not only generating , but experts for relationships .
because they are the ones who are also experts for taste .
and if i &apos;m really honest , you &apos;re a better chef when i &apos;m ever going to be it .
you know , that &apos;s right to me because if the future is good food , it will be delicious .
thank you .
if i want to leave you with one thing today , it &apos;s that the totality of the data we consume is larger than the sum of their parts and instead of thinking about information , i want you to think of patterns that otherwise might not be visible .
so , what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical death diagram for age .
the program i &apos;m using here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called spades , and what i can do with spades is that i can filter after a certain cause of death , we say accidents .
and i immediately see another pattern that makes it happen .
and that &apos;s because in the middle of the middle here , people are most active , and they are over here at the most given .
we can go beyond one step and then rearrange the data and see that cycle diseases and cancer are the usual suspects , but not for everybody .
now , when we zoom in and look at age , we &apos;ll say 40 years , or younger , that accidents are actually the main cause of what people should worry about .
and who continues to see that this is particularly true of men .
so you can see that looking at information and data in this way very much at swimming in a living information graph .
and if we can do that for raw data , why can &apos;t it make content itself ?
now what we have here is the cover images of every single sport , which has ever been printed .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
you can actually test it for my talk in your rooms .
with pivot , you can stay in a decade .
you can stay in a particular year .
you can jump directly to a certain copy .
now , when i look here , i see the athletes that appear in this copy and the sporting species .
i &apos;m a lance armstrong , so i &apos;m going to click on what i &apos;m all talking about in the lance armstrong .
now , if i want to get a match , i could think , &quot; ok , what if i &apos;m going to look at anything with the subject bike ? &quot;
so i &apos;m going to take a step back and get the perspective .
now i see greg lemond .
and so you get an idea of that , that if you go through this kind of information , a wider , broader , zoom , zoom out , you don &apos;t just look at it , you don &apos;t just pick up .
you do something that actually is slightly different .
it &apos;s something in between and we think it &apos;s changing the way information can be used .
now i want to take this idea a little further with something a little bit crazy .
what we &apos;ve done here is we took every single wiki , and reduce them to a little summary .
the summary is a quick overview and a symbol that comes from it .
i just show the top 500 of the most popular egyptians .
but even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things .
we immediately get an idea about the issues that are most popular .
now i &apos;m going to choose the government administration .
now , after i elected the government &apos; war , i know that the experimenter are in the most part of the time magazine .
this is really important because this is an insight that is not in a single curriculum .
that &apos;s just to realize when you step back and look at the whole .
in a particular one of these summaries , i can go into the theme magazine for the year , and see all together .
now , if i look at all these people , the majority of them are government officers . some of them come from science . some , even less , come from the economy . here &apos;s my boss , and one comes from the music section .
and interestingly , bono is a ted prize .
so we can jump now and look at all the ted prize winners .
you see , we &apos;re surfing in the net for the first time , as if it &apos;s really a web , not just from side to page , but a lot more abstract .
and so i want to show you what a little surprise might be .
i &apos;m just showing you the new york times website .
pivot , this application -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not a browser , but you can look at websites with it -- and we bring this in technology to every single website like this .
so i can go back to a step , and directly jump into a specific section .
so this is important because you just look at the data of websites in this way , looking at all the internet flow in the same way .
so i can zoom in into a particular time frame .
here &apos;s the story of the whole demonstration i &apos;ve been thinking about .
and i can sort of see everything i &apos;ve looked at today .
and , again , if i go back to a step and look at everything , i may rearrange my course of the course of my search past , and here , i &apos;ve been looking for &quot; nepotistic . &quot; here i go after a live column .
and from here i can go into the site and put them back up .
it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s used over and over again , and every time it makes it bigger than the sum of the data .
right now in this world , we think that data is a flight .
we talk about the flight of information overstream .
we &apos;re talking about drowning in information .
what if we could turn out this situation and put the internet on the head , so that instead of going from one to another , you start to go from a lot of things , and you can see patterns which otherwise remained hidden ?
if we can do that , then these past data trap , maybe a new source of information .
and , instead of just moving in information , we can get out of it .
and if we know how to know , maybe we can even make wisdom out of it .
so i hear , thank you very much .
i grew up with a fragment of science fiction .
in my school time , i went to school to school every day , every day .
and my nose kept going in a book , a science fiction book , which my thoughts in other worlds took away my thoughts in other worlds , unwared , unwared curiosity .
these curiosity also showed that i always , if i wasn &apos;t in school , went through the forests , and &quot; samples &quot; collected frogs , frogs and snakes and beetles and beetles , and beetles and beetles , all home , were viewed under the microscope .
i was completely science , you know .
it was always about trying to understand the world , and the boundaries of the possible way .
and my love to science fiction seemed to reveal in my environment , because at the time , in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and studied the deep sea .
jacques cousteau came into our rooms with his fascinating shows of animals and places and a world full of wonder that we had never imagined before .
well , this is what i think was very good at the science fiction .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and since it doesn &apos;t have video games , the video games have still been on the computer with computer-generated films , the whole imagery in the media had had to create the images in my head .
this is what we all had to do when we read a book when we read a book , we took the description of the airstrip and put it on the screen in our heads .
my response to this was drawing and drawing of aliens , alien worlds , robots , space ships and all kinds of things .
in math education , i was constantly caught by the teacher , like i was hiding in the back textbook .
creativity had to be out .
and something interesting happened . because what excites me about jacques cousteout was the idea of a completely unknown world here on our planet .
certainly i would never get an alien world with a spaceship . that seemed quite unlikely to me .
but here was a world that i actually could enter , here on earth , and it was as fascinating and exotic as all that , which i &apos;ve always imagined , when i read these books .
so i decided i was going to be there when i was 15 .
the only problem was that i lived in a small village in canada , 1,000 miles away from the nearest ocean .
i didn &apos;t let myself out of that .
i burn my father until finally he finally had a dive in buffalo , new york , made up on the other side of the border where we lived .
i made my collession in a pool of curiosity in the middle of the winter in buffalo , new york .
but the ocean , a real ocean , i got only two years later , when we moved to california .
since then , in the 40 years , i &apos;ve spent about three hours of water , i &apos;ve spent about three hours of water in submersibles .
and i &apos;ve learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the heat ocean , is so rich on fascinating life , as we really can &apos;t imagine .
the nature of nature doesn &apos;t know borders , in contrast to our own , sterile human imagination .
until today , i feel identical awe for what i see on my tracks .
and my love to the ocean keeps the same intensity as usual and ever .
when i looked at a profession , it was the filmmaking .
that seemed the best way to tell my inner desire , to create stories with my need to unite the images .
as a child , i always drew comic books and so forth .
so films of the way , images and stories lead together . it made them .
of course , the stories i looked at was out of science fiction , &quot; terminator , &quot; &quot; aliens , &quot; and &quot; abyss . &quot;
in the abyss , i was able to do my preference for the underwater world , and that &apos;s what we do with the filmmaker .
so basically , my two passions .
something interesting happened in the abyss , to solve a narrator problem in this movie , and that &apos;s what we had to create kind of liquid water -- we used to go back to computer-generated animation , cg , back .
what came out of this was the first computer-generated film interface ever in a movie .
the film didn &apos;t bring any money to just say , he just played his production costs , but i noticed something fascinating : the audience on the whole world was stimulated by the magic that went out of it .
according to arthur clarke &apos;s law , they don &apos;t know more about advanced technology and magic .
so they saw something magical .
and i found that incredibly exciting .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s necessarily being involved in the movie art . &quot;
so we went to &quot; terminator 2 , &quot; my next film , a lot more .
along with ilm , we made the guy out of liquid metal . success was all about how this effect would come .
and it worked . again , we had created something called a magical , and the effect in the audience was the same , but we &apos;ve been playing a little bit of a little bit more money .
from these two experiences , a whole new world , a whole new world of creativity for film creativity .
so i started a company together with my good friend stan winston , who was at the time of the best make-up and creature-designer . she was called &quot; digital turk . &quot;
the basic idea of this company was to skip the timing of analog processes with visual printing pressure , etc .
and we did so , and we managed to have a competition for this .
but in the middle of the &apos; 90s , we realized that we were in the creotre- and quantitative design , which we actually created -- to slow forward .
i had written this piece , &quot; avatar , &quot; which was the measurement of visual effects and computer-generated effects in whole new heights , with realistic human , expressive characters that had been made by cg , and the main characters should be cg . and the world should be cg .
but the highlight is quite beautiful , and people in my company told me we &apos;re not able to be able to do that .
so i shifted that , and i made this other film about the big ship that goes on .
the film studio , i was selling this as &quot; hippo and juliet on a ship . &quot; it became a love movie epic , a passionate movie .
but i actually wanted to dive down to the real breath of the titanic .
that &apos;s why i made the film .
this is the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know that .
i &apos;ve convinced you , by saying , &quot; we go to the throck . we &apos;re doing the real swim .
we &apos;re going to show it in the open sequence of the film .
this is incredibly important . it &apos;s a good job for marketing . &quot;
and i talked them to fund an expedition .
sounds crazy . but again , it goes back to that that your imagination can create a reality .
we actually created six months later , a reality where i found myself in a russian submersible , four miles under the surface of the north atlantic , and looked at the real titanic through a refrigerator eye .
this wasn &apos;t a movie , no hd , that was real .
so , that really blew my mind .
and in preparation , they were enormous . we had to build cameras and light lights and all kinds of things .
and i noticed how much these deep-sea halls , a space mission .
well , they were also highly engineered and managed to innovate .
you go up into these capsule , you fly into this dark , hostile environment , where there is no hope for rescue , if you &apos;re not making it back .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s as if i was in a science fiction film .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
i was obsessed with the study of the deep sea .
anyway , to do that with curiosity and science . it was all . it was adventure , it was curiosity . it was imagination . it was imagination .
and it was an experience that could not give me hollywood .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature for which we could then design a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i would see outside the window .
in some of the world &apos;s expeditions , i saw creatures in thermal sources , and sometimes things that i &apos;ve never seen before , sometimes things that no one had ever seen before , and for the science at the time , we had no words at all .
so that got me right , and i wanted to get more .
and so i met some unusual decision .
after success , i said to myself , &quot; okay , i want to put my main job as a filmmaker in hollywood , and it &apos;s going to be for a day for a day . &quot;
and then we started , we came up with &quot; bismarck , &quot; and they explored with beatrice experiences .
we returned to the swim of the titanic .
we took little robots that we built , which made a fiberglass cable .
our intention was to come in and look at the inside of the ship , which had never been done before .
no one had ever explored the inside of the swim . you didn &apos;t have any resources for it . so we developed the technology .
and now , i &apos;m sitting on the deck of the titanic , in a submersible , and you see plancs that are very similar to these tubes and i know that once the band was played there .
and i fly with a little scholar of the ship of ship .
i actually do it , but my consciousness is within the vehicle .
it felt like i was physically inside the tunnel of the titanic .
this was the most surreal form of a déjade vu , which i &apos;ve ever experienced , because before i got around a corner , i &apos;d always known what was going on in the light of the vehicle , because i ran the movie .
because the set was a very accurate copy of the ship plans .
so that was a very strange experience .
she made me aware of this telepresence experience that you can use such robotic interfaces , and so your consciousness in the vehicle , in those other forms of existence .
it was really immensely profound .
and maybe a little glimpse of what might happen in some decades , if you have cyborg body to study something or to do other things , in all kinds of post-humanums that i can imagine as science fiction .
after this expedition we started , what we saw down there , really appreciate what we were seeing , for example , this deep resource , where we saw these incredibly intriguing animals , but this is the world .
they live with chemosynthesis of chemosynthesis .
they don &apos;t exist in a sunlight system , as we do .
and so you see animals that are right next to 500 degrees centigrade that they can survive there .
at the same time , i was very interested in space science , which was back to science fiction from my childhood .
and so i ended up with the people who are interested in space and doing the nasa , and in the nasa issues , and planning right space plan , they go to russia , and they go to the international space station , and they go to the international space station .
that was fascinating .
but at the end of it , it was that i took space scientists with us in the deep sea .
i took them , and i would give them access to the world down there : astrobiologists , planetary scientists , people who care for such extreme situations . i took them to look at the sources , and so on .
we did documentary films , but we actually run science , actually , to say space science .
so , the circle of my existence as a science fiction , as a child , and the work in reality .
in the course of this journey , i &apos;ve learned a lot .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science , but i &apos;m now thinking , you know , a director must also lead , a leader as a ship or something like that .
i didn &apos;t understand much about leadership before i joined this expedition .
because at a certain point , i had to say , &quot; what am i doing here ?
why do i do that ? what &apos;s out there ? &quot;
these stupid things don &apos;t bring us a money .
we &apos;re just going to play the costs of production . no doubt .
all of you think i &apos;ve gone from &quot; titanic &quot; and &quot; the titanic &quot; avatar , and it would have dropped to me somewhere in a towel on the beach .
i have all these films , these documentary films , for a very small audience .
no fame , no honor , no money . what are you doing ?
you &apos;re doing it for the sake , the challenge -- and the ocean is the most challenging environment that you have . you &apos;re doing it because of the kind of weird connection , and because of the kind of small group of people creating a team of people .
because we did all this with only 10 to 12 people who have been working for years , and sometimes we were two to three months back in sea .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing is the best thing you &apos;ve got in front of each other , because you have a task that you can &apos;t explain any other .
if you go back to land , and you say , &quot; we had to do it , the fiberglass , the soninment , and the whole way around , the whole technology , and the difficulty , the human performance , and the difficulty , the human performance , is that you can &apos;t explain it , and that &apos;s like the policeman , you know , that you can &apos;t explain it . that &apos;s like the policeman , you know , you can &apos;t explain it . that &apos;s what you
there &apos;s a connection , a reciprocally respect .
so when i come back to make my next film &quot; avatar , &quot; i tried to use the same leadership style , which is that you can support your team and touch your own respect .
it was really changed the dynamic .
so , there i was again with a little team on unfamiliar terrain , and we built &quot; avatar with a new technology that didn &apos;t exist before . &quot;
incredibly exciting .
an enormous challenge .
and we became a two-year period for a two-year period of time .
it changed my way to make movies completely .
there were people who said we were actually doing these ocean creatures really well , and on the planet on the pandora .
for me , it was more a controversial way to do my job , the actual process that changed in the outcome .
so what can we do from all this ?
what lessons are we learned ?
i think first of all , the curiosity is curiosity .
it &apos;s the most powerful human feature .
our imagination is a force that can actually create a reality .
and the likelihood of their team is more important than any of the time of the world .
to me , young filmmakers who say , &quot; give me an advice , how i can do something like that . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t limit you .
this is what others get for you . don &apos;t do it yourself , don &apos;t shout against yourself . but take risks on you . &quot;
nasa has such a favorite sentence : &quot; failure is not an alternative . &quot;
but in the art and the study of discovery , failure has to be an alternative , because it guarantee a trust .
not an important undercatch , the innovation asked , has been given without risk .
you have to be ready to take risks like that .
this is the thought that i &apos;d like to leave you with on the way . failure is an alternative , but not . thank you .
today i &apos;m talking to you about energy and climate .
and that may be surprising , because my full-time engagement in the foundation is mostly about vaccines and seeds to make things that we have to make and allow for the poorest two billion .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , even more importantly than any other on the planet .
climate change means that their saads are not going to grow over many years . it &apos;s too much , or too small , and things are going to change as it can &apos;t leave their fragile environment .
this leads to hunger . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to uncertainty .
so , a change will become terrible for you .
also , energy for them is very important for them .
in fact , if you could just reduce one thing , the poverty reduction would be energy at far the most effective .
well , the energy department is about time .
in fact , the progression society is based on energy advances .
the cohleral evolution of the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a fast case in electricity , and therefore we have refrigerators , climate change , we can make modern materials , and so many things do .
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but , if we reduce the price -- let &apos;s halve the price -- we &apos;ll hit a new barrier , and that barrier depends on co2 .
co2 heating the planet and the equation for co2 is actually quite clear .
they rearrange the co2 co2 , which leads to temperature increases and that temperature has a few very negative consequences , effects on the weather and perhaps worse , that the natural ecosystems can &apos;t adapt to the changes , and so the whole systems collapse .
now , the correlation between a carbon rise and the developing temperature changes , and where their other consequences are , there are some disdue , but not very many .
and there &apos;s certainly unclarity about how bad these consequences are going to happen , but they will be extremely bad !
i asked the top scientist several times , &quot; do we really have to come down zero ?
isn &apos;t it enough half or a quarter ? &quot;
the answer is : until we get close zero , the temperature goes further .
so it &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different to say , we have a three-foot truck , which has to be under a three-foot bridge , which you would like to put in the next few feet .
this has to go down to zero .
well , we &apos;re catching a lot of carbon dioxide every year about 26 billion tons .
every americans about 20 tons . people from poor countries , less than one .
in average , it &apos;s about five tons on the planet .
and somehow we need to bring changes that are down to zero .
it &apos;s been constant .
only different economic changes , at all , have changed , and we have to go from fast to reducing the rise and to a reduction to zero .
this equation has four factors . a little bit more compact . you have this thing on the left -- co2 , which you want to bring towards zero , and that will depend on the number of people on the average , the average energy in the average , the average energy for every service and the co2 energy unit .
so let &apos;s look at every factor , and think about how we get it on zero .
probably one of these numbers has to come close to zero .
now that &apos;s fundamental algebra , but let &apos;s go through it .
we first have the population .
today , 6.8 billion people live .
and it turns out to nine billion . that &apos;s moving to nine billion .
if we &apos;re very successful with new vaccine , health care and reproduction drugs , we may be able to reduce 10 percent to 15 percent , but at the time we &apos;re looking at a contrast by 1.3 .
the second factor is the services we use .
this includes everything that we eat , clothing , television , heating .
these are very good things , and poverty is reducing these services almost every one on the planet .
it &apos;s great that this number is rising .
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we might be able to take off and use less , but in average , this number is going to increase every year and so on , and that &apos;s the number of people who are being put together per person .
here &apos;s a very basic service . is there a light at home , so you can read your homework ?
and these students don &apos;t have it , so they go out and read their school assignments under the street .
well , at efficiency , the e , the energy per service , is finally good news .
we have something that doesn &apos;t go up .
because of different successes in the light sector , through other kinds of people , through new ways of building , there are lots of services that make their energy care about 90 percent .
in other surgeries , as the manufacture of making thin , 105 : 05 : 565 -- &amp; lt ; 5 : 05 , five : 05 , or air traffic , the game space is very much smaller .
in total , if we &apos;re optimistic , maybe we get a reduction in a factor of three or maybe even a factor six .
but for the first three factors , we &apos;re now about 26 billion tons of money , and that &apos;s just not enough .
so let &apos;s take a look at the fourth factor -- and this is going to be a key factor -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 that is emitted per unit .
it turns out whether you can get this on zero .
if you burn coal , no .
if you burn natural gas , no .
almost every manufacturing method for electricity is emitting co2 , except the renewables and nuclear energy .
so what we need to do on a global level is to create a new system .
we need energy miracle .
now , when i use the term , i don &apos;t mean the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the pc is a miracle .
the internet and the services is a miracle .
people here have contributed to the development of many of these wonders .
usually there &apos;s no deadline that you need a miracle to a specific date .
usually you &apos;re not just going to be wrong and some of them are not .
but in this case , we have to have a whole gas and a miracle in very short time .
well , i asked myself , how can i really bring that back ?
is there a natural illustration , a demonstration that &apos;s the idea of people here ?
i remembered last year when i got mosquitoes and somehow liked people .
the idea became really tangible for them , you know , there are people who live with mosquitos .
for energy , this was one .
i decided that the release of fireflies are going to be the environment here .
so here are some natural fireflies .
you conert me that you didn &apos;t bite . you probably don &apos;t even get rid of the glass .
well , there are all kinds of playful solutions like this , but they don &apos;t bring much .
we need solutions , either one or several that have an unimaginable scaling and unimaginable reliable , and even though there are many directions where people are looking for them , i really just see five , which can afford these big demands .
i &apos;ve left out , geothermal , fusion and biofuel .
this may be a modern contribution , and if you do better than i expect , that would be great , but my core statement is that we have to work on all five , and we can &apos;t give up , because all of you have significant problems .
let &apos;s first look at the burning fossil fuel , burning from either coal or natural gas .
what you have to do is maybe just , but it &apos;s not . it &apos;s not . you have to get all the co2 that comes out of burning out of the tree , catching , under pressure , and then somewhere , that it stays there .
there are some mushroom projects that are doing this on a 60 percent -- 80 percent level , but getting to 100 percent will become very difficult , and an agreement for the turn of co2 is a great challenge , but the biggest problem here is the campterm question .
who will make it safe ?
who can guarantee something literally many billion times greater than any kind of waste that you can imagine from nuclear and other things ?
that &apos;s a lot of volume .
so this is a tough thing .
next , nuclear energy .
it also has three major problems , and the cost , especially in high-regulted countries , are high . the question for safety is that you can really feel that nothing can go wrong despite the human being .
and what do you do with the waste ?
because even though it &apos;s not very large , there &apos;s a lot of concerns .
so three very difficult problems that might be soluble and that you should be working on .
the last three of the five , i have summarized .
it &apos;s renewables , as they &apos;re often called .
and they also have -- although it &apos;s great , they don &apos;t need fuel -- they have some parts .
one is energy energy that creates these technologies dramatically lower than the power of power .
this is energy , you &apos;re talking about a lot of square miles , thousands of times more space than a normal plant .
also , these vents are understated .
the sun doesn &apos;t seem to be the whole day , it doesn &apos;t seem to be all day , and the wind doesn &apos;t always do it all the time .
so , if you depend on these sources , you have to have a way to have energy in times if you &apos;re not available .
so there &apos;s big price challenges here . there are challenges in the transmission , and if we say that the energy source is out of the country , you don &apos;t just need the technology , you have to deal with the risk that the energy from where else comes from .
and there &apos;s the storage problem .
and to show the dimension , i have all kinds of batteries that are produced , which is , the cars , computers , mobile phones , pops , for everything . and that &apos;s what i &apos;ve been using with the amount of electronic energy , and i found that all the batteries that we could produce , less than 10 minutes of total energy .
so we need a big breakthrough here , something that is going to be a factor of 100 better than the approaches of time .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
this is what happens when you try to get these subcharting sources about saying 20 percent -- 30 percent of the consumer .
if you want to support about 100 percent of it , you need an incredible miracle battery .
now , where are we going to go , what is the right approach ?
a manhattan project ? how do we get to the target ?
what we need is a lot of companies who work on it . hundreds .
in each one of these five regions , we need at least 100 people .
in a lot of them , they &apos;re going to say they &apos;re crazy ! that &apos;s good .
i think here in the ted group , there are many , many who are already engaged there .
bill big has several companies , under another one called esolar , which has great solar technology .
vindie khocka invested in dozens of companies doing great things , and interesting possibilities , and i try to support that .
nathan myhrvold and i fund a company that , perhaps surprisingly , the nuclear approach .
there are some innovations in the nuclear domain ; viagra , liquid .
the evolution has stopped in this industry some time ago , so it &apos;s not a big surprise that some good concepts are around .
the terrapowerpoint concept means that instead of a part of the ancient , one percent , the u235 , we decided to burn the 99 percent , the u238 .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , you &apos;ve been thinking about it for a long time , but you could never be rational to simulate whether it would work , but since then there &apos;s modern supercomputer , you can simulate it and see that , yes , with the right materials , it &apos;s going to go out .
and because you burn this 99 percent , it &apos;s very much better .
in fact , you burn the waste , and you can actually use the waste of waste today as an allovations .
instead of breaking the head , they simply burn it . a great thing .
the uranium is used , a little bit like a candle .
you see that it &apos;s a kind of column , often known as the migrating wave of reactor .
that really solves the fuel problem .
here &apos;s a picture of a place in kentucky .
this is the waste , the 99 percent . you have the part that &apos;s burned today , so it &apos;s called the brigum .
the trains for hundreds of years .
and if you clean ocean water , you get a little bit fuel for the rest of your life .
you know , there &apos;s a lot of challenges there , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to get forward .
let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
what should our testimony look like ?
well , let &apos;s go to the goal that we have to do , and then we talk about it .
many people talk about 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
it &apos;s really important that we get there .
the rest of the 20 percent will be produced in poor countries , and there are still some agriculture . hopefully , whale drone and zscope will be clean .
so , to get these 80 percent , the industrialized countries , including countries like china , are all drasting their electrical generation .
the other grade says whether we &apos;re using the zero emissions technology , whether it &apos;s used in all developed countries and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest .
that &apos;s great .
this is a key element of this segment .
if we go back from there , how should the 2020 occur ?
it should contain the two elements again .
we should use these kinds of things to get reduction on the way . the less we get , the less the co2 will be the co2 , and it &apos;s also the temperature .
but in fact , this note for the things that we &apos;re doing is not all that leads to the big reductions , just the same , or even slightly less important than the other , the speed of innovation for these breakthroughs .
we need to have this breakthroughs with full gas , and we can measure that in corporate numbers , in posters , into mushroom projects and urbanzation .
there &apos;s a lot of great books to this issue .
the al gore book &quot; we have the choice &quot; and david mckays &quot; cloudenergy . &quot;
they really go through it and create a frame where this can be discussed wide , because we need support for all sides .
there &apos;s a few things that have to come together .
that &apos;s a wish .
a very specific wish , that we invent this technology .
if you just gave me a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a vaccine , and that &apos;s what i love , or i could choose that wish , which is , you know , halved energy accounting without carbon . this wish i &apos;ll take .
this has the largest effect .
if we don &apos;t get this wish , the dig between the long term will be terrible in the long term and the short-term term people , between the united states and china , between poor and rich population and almost all of these two billion people in the world .
so what do we need to do ?
what do i appeal to ?
we need to use more research for more research .
if countries are in places like copenhagen , they shouldn &apos;t be talking about co2 .
they should talk about these innovation , and they would be shocked by the very low rates that are spent for these innovative approaches .
we need marketincentives , we need co2 taxes , tax &amp; amp ; trade &amp; amp ; trade is something that creates a signal .
we have to spread the message .
we have to rationrationalize and we have to do the things that are done by the government .
it &apos;s a big wish , but i think we can fulfill it .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you !
thank you . just to understand terrapower something better -- first of all , can you give us an idea of scale of this investment ?
bill gates : to take care of the simulation of a supercomputer , all the major scientists that we &apos;ve done , we just need a few 10 million , and even if we &apos;ve tested our materials in a russian reactor to make sure it &apos;s reasonable , it &apos;s only in the hundred million .
the difficult step is to build the first level of business , to find more billion , the ordinary and the place in which it actually builds the first one .
once the first thing is done , when he &apos;s walking like this , it &apos;s all clear , because the economic sector is so different from energy energy , as we know it .
in order to understand that right , which means to build deep in the ground almost like a vertical column nuclear fuel , and then the process starts , and then the process starts to go down ?
bg : right . now , you &apos;ve got to refill the reactor , so there &apos;s a lot of people and lots of controls that can go wrong . this thing is going to go wrong , and that &apos;s not good .
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can put it for 60 years -- think of a column -- they &apos;re buried without the whole complexity .
and it &apos;s sitting there and it burns 60 years and then it &apos;s done .
a nuclear reactor that offers a solution for the waste .
bg : yeah . now , what happens to the waste : you can let him sit -- there &apos;s a lot less waste with this method -- then you take it and put it in the next reactor and you burn it .
and we start by taking the waste , which exists already , which is in these refrigerators , or dry hertants at the reactors . that &apos;s our fuel fuel .
so this is what was a problem for these reactors , which , in our fill , is dramatically reduced to the landfill of the garbage .
but while they &apos;ve been talking to different people in this world .
where is the biggest interest , what really do ?
bg : now we haven &apos;t set up on a place , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting open rules for everything called the nuclear ar in the name . there are big interests and the people of the company in russia , india , china , and talked about how this is the energy agenda .
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have something in the direction .
this is a kind of thing that was made .
this is a big step forward , but it &apos;s like a slow reactor and some countries have built this , so everybody who has done a fast reactor , a candidate for our first .
in your imagination , what &apos;s really going to be like to do in your mind ?
bg : well , we need one of these scaling , powerable things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to invent and then 20 years .
this is sort of the deadline , which has shown us the environmental models that we have to think of .
and , you know , terrapower , if everything goes well , and that &apos;s a big wish , that might be easy .
and fortunately , today , there are dozens of companies , and we need hundreds and hundreds of people who are working on the way they work for their pilots working for their pilots .
and it would be best if it could create multiple , because then you could use a mixture .
anyway , we need a solution .
most of the great possible breakthroughs , this is the greatest thing you know ?
bg : a energy plan is the most important .
it would have been the environmental imperative , but it &apos;s more important .
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
you know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as these , but there are the modulare method that is another approach .
there &apos;s a liquid reactor , which seems to be a little hard , but perhaps saying that .
and so there are different , but the beautiful thing about it is that a uranium molecule has a million times as much energy as one , we say , a coal molecule , and that &apos;s mostly the radiation , and it &apos;s mostly the radiation , the impact on the land and the cost , and the impact , the impact on the land and the other things .
if that doesn &apos;t work , what ?
do we have to lead consent to try to maintain the temperature of the temperature ?
bg : when you get into this situation , it &apos;s as if you &apos;re eating too much , and you have a little bit of heart attack . what do you do ? you might need a heart surgery or something like that .
there &apos;s a way of thinking about geoengineering , which is to deal with various techniques in order to delay warming , so we spend 20 or 30 years living on us .
that &apos;s just an insurance method .
you hope that we don &apos;t need that .
some people say , you shouldn &apos;t just work on insurance because you may be able to do something like this , so you keep eating , because you know that you will save the heart surgery .
i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s smart , if you take the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s now a discourse in geoengineering about whether you should have that , if things are going to come faster , or these innovation needs longer than we expect .
climaskeptics : do you have one or two sentences for you to convince you ?
bg : well , unfortunately , the skeptic in very different camps .
those who make the scientific arguments are very little .
do you know that there are negative effects to do with the clouds that move things ?
there are very , very few things you can tell at all , from which there is an opportunity in a million .
the main problem here is as much as aids .
you make the mistake now , and you pay for a lot later .
and so the idea here is , now , if you have all kinds of urgent problems to invest in something that you only have later -- and comes to that that the investment is not so clear , that the ipcc report is not necessarily the worst scenario , and there &apos;s people in the rich world that will look at the ipcc .
the fact is that this uncertainty should make us worry .
but my dream here is that , if you can make it economic , and at the same time , the co2 , then you say , &quot; okay , it doesn &apos;t interest me , it &apos;s not a carbon dioxide , i wish it &apos;s going to be because it &apos;s cheaper . &quot;
and that would be your answer to the bjlocal lomborg point that , if you use all these time and energy to solve the co2 problem , all the other goals , the other goals , the poverty reduction , the poverty reduction , the poverty reduction , the poverty and so on , is that there &apos;s a dumb waste that we can do .
bg : well , the actual spending for research -- let &apos;s say the u.s. should spend 10 billion a year than they do today -- that &apos;s not that dramatic .
other things shouldn &apos;t suffer .
and then you get too large sums of money , and you can disagree with reasonable people , if you have something that &apos;s not economic , and it &apos;s trying to fund that , for me , most of the waste .
it &apos;s because , you know , you &apos;re very short at a cost and funded only the learning curve . i think we should try more things that have the potential to be very much cheaper .
if the bottom line you get , a very high energy epic can only keep the rich .
i mean , every one of us here could spend five times as much for our energy without changing its lifestyle .
but for the lower two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
and even lomborg thinks about it .
his new madian is now , &quot; why don &apos;t research be addressed anymore ? &quot;
he &apos;s still going to , because of his former stories , with the skepticism camp , but he understood that this is a very elaborate group and therefore he brings the research argument .
and that &apos;s a leap that i think is appropriate .
research , it &apos;s just crazy , how little it is supporting .
bill , i think for almost all people here , if i say , i really hope that your wish is true . thank you very much .
bg : thank you .
a few years ago , at ted , peter skillman , a design competition called &quot; the marshmallow challenge . &quot;
the idea is pretty simple . fourth teams have to release the largest possible possible structure with 20 spaghetti , about 1m tape , about 1m and a marshmallow .
the marshmallow needs to be up on top .
and , even though it seems really simple , it &apos;s really really hard to work , because it &apos;s very quickly working .
and so i thought this was an interesting idea , and i turned it into a design workshop .
it was a huge success .
since then , i &apos;ve done about 70 workshops around the world , with students , developmental scientists and architects , even with ctos of fortune companies , and there &apos;s something that allows you to share deep senses in nature and i want to share some of them .
usually most people start to orient themselves across the task .
you talk about it , you &apos;re thinking about what it &apos;s going to look like .
then you invest a little bit in planning and organization . you sketch and put spaghetti .
they spend most of their time building all the time in the together .
and finally , before you don &apos;t have time , somebody takes the marshmallow and you put it on the top , step back , and &quot; ta-da &quot; -- admire your work .
but what happens , almost always , is that the &quot; ta-da &quot; is going to be a &quot; uh-oh &quot; because the weight of the marshmallow is that the whole thing will bend and fall down .
there &apos;s a number of people who have a lot more &quot; uh-oh &quot; moments than others , and under the worst are fresh pwl graduate .
they lie , they cheat , they &apos;re confused , and they really make bad shapes .
and of course , there are teams that have a much more &quot; ta-da &quot; shape , and under the best are new graduate grade .
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
as peter told us , they don &apos;t just produce the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
what you might be asking is : how is this ? why ? what about those ?
and peter says , &quot; none of the kids spend time at the time of spaghetti gmbh . &quot;
they &apos;re not investing in power fights .
but there &apos;s another reason .
and that is that bwl students were trained to find a real plan , ok !
and then realize it .
what happens when you put the marshmallow on the top , you don &apos;t have time more and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sound familiar , what ?
what children do differently is that they start with the marshmallow and build prototypes , successfully with the marshmallow on top of the top , so that they have multiple prototypes to fix the possibility .
calculating these types of collaboration as the core of a iterative process .
and with every trial , the kids get directly feedback and what doesn &apos;t .
so the performance is to work with prototypes , but we see how different teams operate .
the average for most of them is about 50 inches , bwl students , half of them are doing something more , but not much , children &apos;s garden children are better than the adults .
who is the most successful ?
architects and engineers , for happiness .
1m is the highest thing i &apos;ve seen .
and why ? because you understand triangles and self-amplification geometric patterns that are key to building stable structures .
ceo is something about average . but here it is going to be interesting .
you put an accurate administrator on the team , you become significant .
it &apos;s incredible . you look around and you see , &quot; this team will win . &quot;
you can predict the predictions . why is that ?
because they have special skills of processing .
they run the process , they understand it .
and that team , the secret and the work , is vital to the power of the team .
specialized skills and processing skills and its combination lead to success .
if you have 10 teams that are typical , you get about six , the stable structures .
i tried something interesting now .
i thought , let &apos;s bring the pokerment right .
so i offered a 10,000-dollar prize to the winner .
what do you think happened to these design students ?
what was the result ?
this is what happened . not a team had a stable structure .
if anyone built a five-inch construction , he would have carried the prize home .
so is it not interesting that high competition have a strong effect ?
we repeated this exercise with the same students .
so what do you think happened ?
now , they understood the &quot; prototyping . &quot;
so from the same , bad team of one under the best .
they produced the highest construction in the least time .
so there are some profound lessons for us , about the nature of drive and success .
you might ask : why would someone actually invest a minority code to create a minority challenge ?
the reason is , i help digital tools and processes to help create a team , cars , video games and visuals .
and what the marshmallow challenge does is it helps you identify assumptions .
because open , every project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge offers a common experience , a common language , or basic posture , to build the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , this so simple exercise .
and those of you who are interested in that can visit minority extremictives .
it &apos;s a blog where you can see how to build the marshmallow .
there &apos;s a pac-step manual there .
you find crazy examples from all around the world , like people inject the system and cooling it .
there are also environmental cords .
and the base lesson , i think , is actually the construction of sports .
it requires that we all have our senses on the task , and that we use our thinking about how our emotions and our emotions are , in the challenge , that lies in front of us .
and sometimes a small prototype of this experience is everything that takes it from a &quot; uh-oh &quot; moment to a &quot; uh-oh &quot; moment .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you .
do we have a machine here ?
a big machine , a cool ted machine , and that &apos;s a time machine .
and everyone in this room has to be inside .
and you can go to the past , you can go into the future ; you can &apos;t stay in here and now .
and i wonder what they would choose because i &apos;ve been asking my friends at last time , and they wanted to go to the past .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back to the time before there were cars or twitter or &quot; america . &quot;
i don &apos;t know .
i believe that somehow you &apos;re kind of drawn to the nostalgia .
and i understand that .
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to go to the past , and that &apos;s not because i &apos;m an adventurer .
it &apos;s because opportunities on this planet don &apos;t go back , they go forward .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
this is the greatest time , the biggest time that we &apos;ve ever had on this planet , no matter what scale they are : health , welfare , perceptions , chance of disease .
there was never a time like this .
my great-great-grandparents died when they were 60 .
my grandparents beat these numbers to 70ize .
my parents are 80 to the fersen .
so there &apos;s better one in the beginning of my death number .
but it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
a kid who &apos;s born today in new delhi can expect to live as long as the richest man on the planet 100 years ago .
think about it . this is an incredible fact .
and why is that ?
smallpox . smallpox , you have billions of people killed on this planet .
they reformed the earth &apos;s demographics in a way that no war has ever done .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
we put them down . puff .
in the rich world there are diseases that have millions of us even threatened by one generation , hardly yet .
diphway , tube , children &apos;s paralysis ...
anybody even know what that is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , are successes of scientific method .
and from my point of view , the scientific method is to try and try and see if it works , it changes if it doesn &apos;t , one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
so that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , the whole good news , because there &apos;s a few other problems , and they &apos;ve been mentioned often .
and one of them is that despite all of our achievements , a billion people are hungry in this world every day .
this number goes up , and it goes very fast , and it &apos;s embarrassing .
and not only that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to devaalize the world .
water , urable land , rainforests , gas , gas : they disappear , and soon , and if we don &apos;t get out of that mess , we &apos;re going to get away from that mess .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that will feed billions of people without the land that they live on .
i think we can power this world with energy that they &apos;re not at the same time .
i think that really , and no , that &apos;s not a neg .
but this is holding me awake at night -- one of the things that keeps me awake at night . we &apos;ve never used scientific progress like this now , never yet .
and we &apos;ve never been able to put it perfectly reasonable , as we can now .
we &apos;re at the threshold of an amazing , amazing event on many areas , and yet i really think we &apos;re going to go back hundreds , 300 years before the enlightenment , to find a time where we &apos;ve had progress in which we have gotten over these things .
people fall in their faith , and it &apos;s so closely that you can &apos;t release them .
not even the truth will be free .
and listen , everyone has a right to think of his mind , even a right to think about progress .
but you know where you don &apos;t have a right ?
they don &apos;t have a right to their own facts . &apos; &apos; school , they don &apos;t .
and i took a while to figure that out .
about a decade ago , i wrote an article about vaccination for the new yorker , a little article .
and i was amazed to break on resistance , on resistance to what &apos;s the most effective thing in health care in human history .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i just did what i always do , i wrote an article and drove .
and soon , i wrote an article about genetic foods .
the same thing , just bigger .
people were playing crazy .
so i wrote an article , and i couldn &apos;t understand why the people thought that they were &quot; frankenfood , &quot; why they believed that molecules would push on a certain way to the field of nature .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i kept going .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
we type , we &apos;re rich , we &apos;re going to eat , that &apos;s okay .
but this article worried me , and i couldn &apos;t find out why , and then i found it out .
and that &apos;s because these fanatics , who were crazy at me , were no fanatics at all .
these were surrounded people , educated people , decent people .
they were just like people in this room .
and that was so confused .
but then i thought , you know what , be honest .
we &apos;re at a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress as we used to .
we &apos;re talking more about it .
we &apos;re talking ironic about it , with little leaders , &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , so there are reasons , and i think we know what &apos;s reasons .
we have trust in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science , and there &apos;s no reason why it shouldn &apos;t be .
you can just name a few names and people will understand .
chernobyl , bhopal , the challenger , vioxx , mass destruction , the u.s. presidential election 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are issues and problems with people that we thought would always have been right . so be skeptical .
ask questions , ask for evidence , ask for evidence .
don &apos;t take anything for granted .
but now it &apos;s coming : if you get to get this evidence , and you &apos;re not good at it .
and i can say that that we &apos;re now in an epidemic of fear , as i &apos;ve never seen before , and hopefully i &apos;ll never see .
about 12 years ago , a story published , a terrible story that was the autism epidemic with the mass , muya , and roman vaccine .
very dreadful .
the study of studies were done to see if that was true .
it should be done by studies ; that &apos;s a serious issue .
the data came in .
the data came in from the united states , from the u.k. , from sweden , from canada , and they were all the same , no correlation , no connection .
it doesn &apos;t matter . it doesn &apos;t make any difference because we believe in anecdotes , we believe what we see , what we see , what makes us feel real .
we don &apos;t believe in a series of documents of a government that gives us data , and i understand that , i think we all do .
but you know what ?
the result of that was devastating .
catastrophic because of this fact : the united states is one of the only countries in the world where immunites go down for masdies .
this is scandalous and we should be ashamed .
it &apos;s terrible .
what happened is we could do that .
well , i understand that . i do .
because anybody here has mass ?
has one in the audience ever seen someone die of mass ?
it &apos;s not very often happening .
this is not happening in the country at all , but 160,000 times in the world last year .
this is a lot of deaths by masyers , 20 per hour .
but because this is not happening here , we can do it , and people like jenny mccarthy can walk around and messages of fear and ililtism of platforms like oprah and larry king live live .
and they can do that because they don &apos;t connect the cause and the correlation .
you don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be equal , but almost never is the same thing .
and that &apos;s something we need to learn , and it &apos;s very quick .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .
he would liberate us from one of the worst heads of humanity .
no fear , no quals , children &apos;s paralysis , puff disappeared .
the guy in the middle doesn &apos;t .
he &apos;s called paul offit .
he has just developed a little bit of other people &apos;s vaccine .
he can save the lives of 400- , 500,000 children per year in the developing world .
pretty good , isn &apos;t it ?
well , this is good , besides that paul runs around and talks about vaccines and says how valuable they are , and that people should just stop laughing .
and that &apos;s what he actually says .
so paul is a terrorist terrorist .
if paul talks to a public , he can &apos;t talk without armed guards .
he gets phone calls , because people like to tell him that they know where his children go to school .
and why ? because paul made a vaccine .
i don &apos;t need to say that , but vaccines are unregulated .
take it away , get the diseases back , terrible diseases , and that &apos;s what happens .
we &apos;ve got mass now in this country .
and that gets worse , and pretty soon kids will die again , because that &apos;s just a question of numbers .
and they &apos;re not only going to die on mass .
what about sex paralysis ? let &apos;s do it . why not ?
a composition of mine i wrote a couple of weeks ago , and i said , &quot; i &apos;m a little bit to lock . &quot;
nobody said that before .
she wouldn &apos;t vaccinate her child against children &apos;s legacy .
fine .
why ? because we don &apos;t have a child paralysis , and you know what ?
we had no child paralysis in this country yesterday .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe this morning , somebody in lagos is a plane and flies right now to los angeles , right now it &apos;s about ohio .
and in a few hours , he goes and rented a car , and he comes to long beach , and he &apos;s going to visit one of these fabulous ted dinner tonight .
and he doesn &apos;t know he &apos;s infected with a paralyzing disease , and we don &apos;t know , because this is how the world works now .
this is the planet that we live on . don &apos;t do it as if it &apos;s not .
we love to fall in lie . we love that .
did you all take all your vitamins tomorrow ?
echinacea , a little antioxitium , which helps you to go on the brakes .
i know they did that because half the americans do that every day .
they take the stuff , and they take alternative cure , and it doesn &apos;t matter how often we find that they &apos;re useless .
the data shows the constantly .
it evaporates your urine . more do you almost never .
this is okay , you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark europeans .
i &apos;m very familiar with you .
dark urine . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
well , i think i understand the drug industry .
we hate too strong government . we don &apos;t have trust into the system .
and that &apos;s not what we should do . our health care is mies .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely amazing to us , and the sea itself can afford to us .
so we walk away , and where do we walk ?
we &apos;re running in the arms of placebo industry .
this is great . i love the placebo industry .
but you know , this is really a serious issue , because the stuff is crap , and we give billions of dollars .
and i have all kinds of boxes here .
kone of them -- gingko , fraud , echinaca , fraud , acai , i don &apos;t even know what that is , but we give billions of dollars to it , it &apos;s fraud .
and you know what ? if i say that , people scream to me and say , &quot; what does it take you ? let people do what they want .
that &apos;s how they feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? they &apos;re wrong .
because it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s health care , it says , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m not going to accept the evidence of my experts &apos; evidence , &quot; or any cancer source , who wants to treat his patient with kaffel .
if you go to that path , where and you get magic and magic evidence and science , you get to a place where you don &apos;t want to be .
they get to thabo mbeki in south africa .
he brought 400,000 of his people to , because he insisted that red charge , they &apos;re also a lot more efficient , and they &apos;re much more efficient than antiretroviral drugs that we know about the course of aids .
hundreds of thousands of unnecessarily death deaths in a country that will be worse than any other one of this disease .
please tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences .
they have . they always have them .
well , the brain loseest epidemic in which we are right now is this absurde struggle between the fear of anxiety , and the bio-elite .
this is an idiotic debate . it has to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
this is ideology , not science .
everything we eat , every blow of rice , every branch of parsie , was changed by the people .
you know , there was no client in paradise .
there were no cantalouctctons .
there &apos;s no christmas trees . we did it all .
we did it in the last 11,000 years .
and some of them have worked , and they don &apos;t .
we &apos;ve become more like what doesn &apos;t work .
now we can do it more carefully , and , of course , there are risks . but we can do something like vitamin a in rice , and the stuff can help millions of people , millions of people , their lives .
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
i have to say , i don &apos;t understand that .
we are rejecting food .
why do we do that ?
now , what i &apos;m all hearing is : too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , monopoly , monoculture , we don &apos;t want to deal with a whole thing that &apos;s wrong .
we don &apos;t want companies patent .
we don &apos;t want companies to have seeds .
and you know what my answer is on all that ?
yeah , they &apos;re right . fix that .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge food problem , but it &apos;s not science .
this has nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s right , morality , patent stuff .
you know , science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it &apos;s working and sometimes not , but the idea that we shouldn &apos;t allow the science to do their work , because we &apos;re afraid to do a really dead , and it &apos;s holding millions of people off the pipeline .
you know , in the next 50 years we will have to grow 70 percent more food than at the moment . 70 percent .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
shame . shame .
you need it , and we don &apos;t give it to you .
and why ? visual changed food .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this stuff , like manily .
maniok is something that is half a billion people .
it &apos;s about a mapping .
it &apos;s just a bunch of calories . it &apos;s mies .
it doesn &apos;t have nutrients , it doesn &apos;t have protein , and scientists are building all that in it .
and then people could eat this and wouldn &apos;t be blind .
you wouldn &apos;t starch , and you know what ?
it would be beautiful . it wouldn &apos;t be chez pandeen , but it would be beautiful .
and all i can say is , why do we fight that ?
i mean , ask ourselves , why do we fight that ?
because we don &apos;t want to push around genes ?
it &apos;s not about push genes around . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our graves on greater food , better food , better food .
it &apos;s not about rice crisis , it &apos;s about keeping people alive , and it &apos;s going to be time to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we don &apos;t do that , if we do that as usual as we do , we do something guilty about , i think , not want to be guilty of colonialism .
there &apos;s no other description of what &apos;s going on here .
it &apos;s self-addictive ; it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s our not worthy , and we really need to stop that .
so after this incredibly funny conversation , you might want to say , &quot; are you still going to go into this ridiculous time machine and into the future ? &quot;
anyway . that &apos;s what i want to do anyway .
right now , it &apos;s in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can put this time machine on everything we want .
we can move them where we want to move them , and we &apos;re going to move them into where we want .
we have to take these conversations , and we need to think , but when we go into the time machine , we &apos;re going to be happy to have that .
i know we can , and as far as it is , it &apos;s something that needs the world now .
thank you .
thank you .
for some time , i &apos;ve been interested in the placebo effect , and it may seem strange that a magician cares about it , because they &apos;re looking at it like me , as &quot; a deception , &quot; when someone just believes it .
in other words , the sugar pills have shown a measurement effect , the placebo effect , and that &apos;s because the person thinks what &apos;s going on with her , is a pharmaceutical or a kind of ... in the painful management of the body , for example , if the patient is only holding it up .
a deception becomes something important because somebody takes it so much .
so we also understand each other , i want to show you a very basic , very simple magic trick .
and i &apos;m going to show you how it works . this is a trick that has at least been in every magic book for children .
i learned him from cub scout magic to the 1970s .
i &apos;m going to do it for you and then explain it .
and then i &apos;m going to explain why i explain it .
so , look what happens .
the knife you can study ; my hand you can study .
i &apos;m just going to hold the knife in my love .
i get my sleevback back .
and to make sure that there &apos;s nothing in my sleeving or out of him , i &apos;m just going to push my wrist right here .
in this way , you can see that none of anything is going on , and as long as i push here , there can be nothing in my sleevps or coming .
and the goal is very simple .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully , if everything goes well , the knife is held through my blog magnetic magnetism .
it &apos;s actually sitting on his place that i can shake it , without the knife falling down .
nothing goes into my sleevor or comes out , no guarantee , and you can study everything .
ta-da !
now , this is a trick that i often put little kids on , who are interested in magic , because you can learn a lot about deception when you see a very simple trick .
many of you probably know a lot of them here in the room .
it works like this .
i hold the knife in my hand .
i say that i have my wrist to make sure that nothing in my sleeving disappears or end , and that &apos;s a lie .
the reason why i &apos;m holding my wrist old , is that it is the real secret of illusion .
because in the moment i &apos;m going to take my hand away from you , so you &apos;ll see it moving from the back , this finger is here , my finger , just from there , where he was so balanced .
great trick ?
there &apos;s somebody who has no childhood .
so , he &apos;s here . right .
and when i turn around , the fingers change its position .
and now you could talk about why this is a deception , why you don &apos;t get to see that there &apos;s only three fingers down here : because the mind and the way he can process information is not one , two , three , but as a group .
but that &apos;s actually not what it &apos;s really about . and then i open my hand .
of course , it &apos;s written there , but not by the magnetism of my body , but through a trick , through my finger , which is there now .
and when i close my hand , the same thing happens by turning back , going through this movement , that the finger is moving back .
i take this hand away . and here &apos;s the knife .
this trick can show you your friends and neighbors . thank you .
now , what does that have to do with the placebo effect ?
in front of a year or something , i read a study that really resonated me .
i &apos;m not a doctor or a researcher , and that &apos;s why it was an amazing thing to me .
it turns out that if you offer a placebo in the form of a white ball , in the form of an innoinpill , it &apos;s just a round , white pill , which has a particular bar .
but if you put the shape in which you &apos;re giving the placebo , for example , changes into a smaller ball , and that blue color and a letter on it , it &apos;s actually measurable efficiency .
and that , although none of any pharmaceutical ... it &apos;s just sugar pills .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
what ? i really did that .
but it turns out that it &apos;s not all that .
if you take capches , they &apos;re more effective than a tablet .
a colored capsule , which is at an end , yellow and on the other red , is better than a white capsule .
also , the doization plays a role .
a pill twice a day is not as good as three pills -- i can &apos;t remember the statistics now . sorry .
but the key thing is , ...
and that also is a role of play .
and the shape plays a role .
and if you want to have the ultimate impact effect , you need to reach the needle .
right ? a syringe with a more effective -- a few milliliters of a commodity substance that you injected to a patient .
this creates a very strong picture in the head , which is very much stronger than a white pill .
this chart is really ... i &apos;m going to show you another time if we have a projector .
so the fact is that the white pill doesn &apos;t seem as good as the blue pill that doesn &apos;t seem as good as a capsule that doesn &apos;t seem like the needle .
and none of it has some really pharmaceutical property . it &apos;s just our faith in that that we have a stronger effect .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
i &apos;ll take something which is obviously a deception , and let &apos;s look real .
we know from this study that you need to reach to the needle when you want to go to this .
this is a six-inch long hover needle . it &apos;s very , very porous , and i &apos;m going to start it a little bit of sanitation .
this is really my meat . it &apos;s not a wilian special meat .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood .
i &apos;m going to put this needle into my skin , and go through it through the other side .
if you &apos;re getting sick -- if you &apos;re slightly in oise -- i &apos;ve launched a couple of friends last night in the hotel room , and some people that i didn &apos;t know , and it has become a woman that i didn &apos;t know .
so i &apos;m going to suggest , if you &apos;re going to get fast , you look at the next 30 seconds , or you know what , i &apos;m going to make the first disease in the back here .
you can see it immediately , but you can see , if you want .
so , it &apos;s so , right here , where my meat starts , at the bottom of my arm , i &apos;m just going to make a little break .
i &apos;m really sorry . does it make you crazy ?
and now just a little bit of a little bit of my skin and on the other side .
now we &apos;re actually in the same situation that we had on the block of measuring .
about it .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
so , i &apos;m going to show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well .
i know what people think when they see that .
they say , &quot; okay , that &apos;s not so stupid , and it &apos;s not as dumb as the skin , just to talk to us for a few minutes . &quot;
now , i &apos;ll show it to you .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and the people behind the back say , &quot; okay . i haven &apos;t seen this right . &quot;
people in the side room are now coming in .
let me show you the close line .
this is really my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
that &apos;s my flesh , and i can rotate it around .
i &apos;m sorry . if you &apos;re sick , look away , don &apos;t look .
the people in the back or the ones that later look at video eventually will say , &quot; well , well , this looks pretty impressive , but if it was real , it would be a hole , and if it really would be really , you would see it . &quot;
okay , let me just throw a little blood out of you .
yeah , here it is .
i normally would take the needle out .
i would get my arm and show you that there are no wounds .
but i think in this frame here , and with the intention of doing something real , i &apos;m just going to get the needle in there and so forth .
we &apos;re going to take a couple of times in the next few days .
i hope you &apos;re looking for it . thank you very much .
everybody &apos;s talking about happiness today .
i &apos;ve got some people who have gotten the number of books that were published with &quot; happiness &quot; in the last five years , and they gave them about 40 , and there was a lot more .
there &apos;s an enormous wave of interest in happiness among researchers .
there &apos;s a lot of happiness .
everyone would like to make people happier .
but despite all of these pipes , there are several cognitive ones that are sort of impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk today is going to be mainly by these cognitive ones .
it &apos;s true for laien who think about their own happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists who think about happiness because it turns out we &apos;re just like everybody else .
the first of these fall is an incursive , complexity .
it turns out that the word happiness is simply not useful , because we apply it to too many different things .
i think there &apos;s a certain meaning that we could close it , but in large and whole , that &apos;s something we need to give up , and we will have to take the complicated view of what is well-being .
the second trap is a change of experience and memory : essentially it &apos;s between happy in his life and happy about his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both cloned in the notion of happiness .
and the third is the focus illusion , and that &apos;s the happy fact that we can &apos;t think about a situation that affects the well-being , without its significance .
i mean , this is a real cognitive case .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
now , i would like to start with an example of someone who had a fraph meeting after one of my lectures , which was telling a story . &#91; unclear &#93; he said he heard a symphony , and it was absolutely lovely music , and it was absolutely lovely , and it was really a terrible set of the picture .
and then he added , really , really emotional , which has ruined all the experience .
but it didn &apos;t .
what had been ruined was the memories of the experience .
he had the experience .
he had 20 minutes of sweet music .
they didn &apos;t count because he was loving with a memory ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was everything he had to keep .
what really tells us is we could think about ourselves and other people in the sense of two types of self .
there &apos;s a life of self that lives in the present , and the present knowledge is capable of experiencing the past , but basically the present .
it &apos;s the living self that the doctor &apos;s license -- you know , when the doctor says , &quot; does it hurt when i put it here ? &quot;
and then there &apos;s an expectation of self , and the memory itself is that it counts and the story of our lives gets upright , and it &apos;s the doctor who speaks to the question by saying , &quot; how did you feel in recent time ? &quot;
or &quot; how did your journey go to albania ? &quot; or something like that .
these are two very different units , the living self and the memory itself , and the two of them are part of the different part of the concept of happiness .
now , the memory itself is a storyteller .
and that really starts with a fundamental reaction to our memories -- it starts immediately .
we don &apos;t just tell stories to tell us stories .
our memory tells us stories , which means that what we can keep from our experience is a story .
and let &apos;s start with an example .
there &apos;s an old study .
these are real patients that are taking care of a painful procedure .
i &apos;m not going to go into the details . it &apos;s not painful today , but it was painful , but it was painful , when this study was done in the 1990s .
they were asked to report every 60 seconds about their pain .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
and they &apos;re asked , &quot; who has suffered more ? &quot;
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
patient b clearly has suffered more . his cheese reflection was longer , and every minute of pain , the patient had patient b , and more .
but now there &apos;s another question : &quot; how much did these patients do that they suffered ? &quot;
and here &apos;s a surprise .
and the surprise is that patient a is a much worse reminder of the gut as a patient b.
the stories of reflection were different , and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends .
and none of these stories are very poor or great -- but one of them is clear ...
but one of them is radically worse than the other .
and the one who &apos;s worse was where the pain was at the end of its peak . it &apos;s a bad story .
how do we know that ?
because we asked these people to mirror mirror , and also much later , &quot; how bad was the whole thing overall ? &quot;
and she was much worse for a b than for b .
well , this is a direct conflict between the living self and the memory itself .
from view of the living self , b clearly had a better time .
well , what you could do with patient a , and we &apos;ve actually done clinical experiments , and it &apos;s been done , and it &apos;s been done , and it works , you could actually make the gut reflections of a patient just not to shake on it .
that will lead to the patient , but only a little bit less than before .
and if you do that for a few minutes , you make that the living self is worse from the patient , and you &apos;ve made it that the memory itself is much better from patient a , because now you have patient a better history about his experience .
so what is a story ?
and that &apos;s true for the stories that blame us and it &apos;s true for the stories that we invent .
and so what a story is about is draining , major moments and end .
end are very , very important and in this case , the end of the end .
well , the living self lives forever .
it has eyes of life , one after the other .
and they ask : what happens to these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever .
i mean , most of our moments of life -- and i &apos;ve figured that out -- you know , the psychological present is about three seconds long . what does it mean , you know , in a life about 600 million of them , there are about 600 million of them in a lifetime .
most of them are completely ignored by memory itself .
and yet , somehow you get the impression that you should count that what &apos;s happening during that eye of life is our life .
it &apos;s limited resource that we use while we &apos;re on this world .
and as we would use them , it seems to be important , but that &apos;s not the story that keeps the remind itself for us .
so we have the memory itself and the living self , and they &apos;re quite different .
the biggest difference between them is to deal with time .
from view of the living self , if you have a holiday and the second week is just as good as the first week , the two-week vacation is twice as good as the week week .
that &apos;s not how it works at all .
for the memory itself , a two-week vacation is barely better than the one-week vacation , because there are no new memories added .
they don &apos;t changed the story .
and in this way , time is the critical variable , which is a reminder of itself from a living self . time has very little influence on this story .
well , the memory itself makes more than remember and telling stories .
it &apos;s actually , in fact , the choices , because if you have a patient who had two , we had two different findings in two different surgeons and decides to decide what to pick up the memory that &apos;s going to be the memory that &apos;s going to be selected .
the living self has no voice in that election .
in fact , we don &apos;t choose between experience . we choose between experiences .
and even if we think about the future , we don &apos;t usually think of our future as experiences .
we think about our future as a prediction of consciousness .
and basically , you can look at this , you know , as a tyranny of remember self , and you can think of yourself as one , which is sort of the living self by experience that doesn &apos;t need the living self .
i have the impression that when we &apos;re doing a holiday that is very often the case , which means we &apos;re making vacation tests in the service itself .
and that &apos;s a little hard to justify , i think .
i mean , how much are we from our memories ?
this is one of the explanations that &apos;s given for the dominance self .
and when i think about it , i think of a holiday that we did a couple of years ago in antarctica , which was clearly the best vacation i had ever had , and i think relatively often about how often i think about other vacation .
and i probably have my memories in these three week , i would say about 25 minutes in the last four years .
well , if i had ever opened the folder with the $ 600 images , i &apos;d spent another lesson .
well , these are three weeks , and that &apos;s just a half a week .
there seems to be an unconsistent thing .
now , i may be a little extreme , you know , how little appetite i have on the cehole of memories , but even if you give more of it , you have a real question to the weight that we give the experience ?
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
imagine your next holiday , you know that at the end of the vacation , all of your images will be destroyed , and you get an amnestic drug , so you won &apos;t remember anything .
now , would you like the same vacation ?
and if you would pick a holiday , there &apos;s a conflict between your two types of self and you have to think about how you &apos;re going to decide that conflict and that &apos;s really not obvious , because if you think of it in the sense of time , you get a different answer .
why we choose the vacation that we choose is a problem that provides us with a choice between the two types of self .
well , the two types of self throw two words from happiness .
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can apply to one self .
so you can ask : how happy is that living self ?
and then you would ask : how happy are the eyes in life itself ?
and they &apos;re all -- happiness is a pretty complicated process .
which is the emotions that can be measured ?
and , by the way , we &apos;re now able to get a pretty good idea of happiness from happiness itself over time .
if you ask questions about the happiness self , it &apos;s a very different thing .
it &apos;s not about how happy one person lives .
it &apos;s about how happy or delighted , if that person thinks about your life .
very different term .
everybody who &apos;s not different at this point is the study of happiness , and i &apos;m about to give you a lot of researchers about well-being that messed exploration of happiness for a long time .
the distinction between happiness itself and the satisfaction of memory is realized in the last few years , and now you &apos;re trying to measure the two separate .
the gallup organization has a worldwide survey where more than half a million people have been asked about , what they think about their lives and about their experiences , and there were other efforts in the direction .
so in the last few years , we started learning about the happiness of the self .
and the main lesson that we have , i think , is that they &apos;re really different .
you can know how somebody is happy with his life , and it really doesn &apos;t really teach you how happy he lives and vice versa .
just to give you a sense of the correlation , the correlation is about five and a half .
what that means is that if you meet somebody and you would tell them , oh , his father is a two-meter man , how much would you know about his size ?
well , you would know something about its size , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
if i tell you that somebody has a life as eight in a scale of 10 , they have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with his living self .
so the correlation is little .
we know something about the happiness of happiness .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know that happiness fundamentally means being happy with people we like , spend time with people we like .
there &apos;s other pleasure , but that &apos;s dominant .
so if you want to maximize the happiness of the self , you &apos;re going to do very different things .
the implication of what i &apos;ve said here is that we really shouldn &apos;t imagine ourselves as a substitute for well-being .
it &apos;s a completely different notion .
well , very quickly , another reason that we can &apos;t think about happiness is that we &apos;re not paying attention to the same things if we think about life and when we actually live .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people are in california are not getting the correct answer .
if you ask that question , you think that people in california have to be happier when they say , in ohio .
and what happens is that if you think about life in california , think about the difference between california and other places , and that difference , we say , in climate .
well , it turns out that climate isn &apos;t very important for the living self , and it &apos;s not even very important for reframing self that decides how happy people are .
now , because it &apos;s self-responsible , you can end up at the end -- some people could go to california .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to pursue what happens with people who go to california , happier .
now , your life will not be happier .
we know that .
but one thing is going to happen . you &apos;ll think they &apos;re happier because if you &apos;re going to think about it , how awful the weather was in ohio , and you will feel that they made the right decision .
it &apos;s very difficult to think about well-being , and i hope i &apos;ll give you a sense of how difficult it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question for you .
thank you .
now , when we did a couple of weeks ago , they told me that there was a pretty interesting outcome that came out of this gallup survey .
is that something you can share with , because now you have a few minutes left ?
daniel kahneman : sure .
i think the most interesting result we found in the gallup survey is a number that we didn &apos;t expect to find .
we found that in terms of happiness itself .
if we looked at how emotions relate to income .
and it turns out that under an income of 60,000 dollars a year , for americans , and that &apos;s a very big sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a big representative sample under an income of 600,000 dollars a year .
60,000 .
dk : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars a year , people are unhappy , and they become increasingly insecure , the poorer they will .
that &apos;s where we get an absolutely flat line .
i mean , i rarely saw that flat lines .
what happens is , obviously , money does not bring a experience happiness , but that lack of money is certainly misery , and we can measure this misery very , very clearly .
in the spirit of the other self , the memory itself , you get a different story .
the more money you deserve is you &apos;re .
that &apos;s not true of emotions .
but danny , in the entire american pursuit of life , is freedom , freedom for happiness .
if people would take this place seriously , i mean it &apos;s all on the head , everything we believe in , for example , in terms of tax politics and so on .
is there a chance that politicians , in general , that the country would take a place like seriously taking and based on politics ?
dk : you know , i think there are recognition for the role of happiness in politics .
the recognition is going to be slow in the united states , not a question , but in the united kingdom , it &apos;s just happening in the united kingdom .
people are in the process of realizing that they should think of happiness when they think about politics .
it &apos;s going to take a while , and people will discuss whether they want to study experience happiness or whether they want to study life review , so we have to take this discussion pretty soon .
how to get lucky to happiness is very different from how you think and whether you think about it yourself or whether you think of the living self .
that &apos;s going to affect politics , i think , in the next few years .
in the united states , you get to measure the experience happiness of the population .
this is what i think will be in the next one or two decades of the national statistics .
well , it seems to me , this topic is going to be , or should be at least the most interesting political debate about the next few years .
thank you for the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you , danny kahneman .
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal .
i &apos;ve been developing now for 10 years online games , and my goal for the next decade is to make it easy to save the world in reality , as it is in online games .
i have a plan for this . i want to convince more people , including all of them , to play more time with the game , and to spend more amazing games .
we currently spend three billion hours a week with online play .
some of you might think , &quot; this is a whole lot of time for games . &quot;
maybe too much time , if you think about how many problems we &apos;ve identified in the real world .
but in fact , my research at the institute for the future for the future is exactly the opposite .
three billion hours a week aren &apos;t nearly enough to solve the most urgent problems in the world .
in fact , i &apos;m convinced that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to dramatically increase this time .
i &apos;ve calculated that the time at 21 billion hours of play is a week .
this may seem to be a little bit off , so i can make it happen , so that if we have problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflicts , global conflicts , and obesity , i think we need to try to play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week .
no , i really mean it seriously .
why ? this image is quite precisely why i think games are so essential for the survival of the human species in the future . seriously .
this is a portrait of the photographer phil toleledano .
he wanted to capture the feelings in play , so he &apos;s built a camera .
this is one of the classic expressions of play .
if you &apos;re not a player , you may have some of the nuances in this picture .
you &apos;re probably looking at this sense of urgency , a fear of urgency , but also the first concentration of concentration , in a really difficult way to solve it .
if you &apos;re also playing , you see some nuances here , which are up to the top of the eyes and the mouth of optimism . the eyebrows surprise surprise .
this is a player who stands on the edge of what &apos;s called epan sieges .
oh , you know that . ok . nice . so we have some players here .
a epic victory is a result that is so highly positive that they didn &apos;t know at all .
it was almost beyond imagination .
and if you do it , you &apos;re shocked to actually be able to do something like this . that &apos;s a epic victory .
this player is a little bit ahead of a epic victory .
and this is what we need to see on millions of faces of problem-solving in the world , if we take the barriers of the next century in attacking the next century . the face of the people who are in the opposite of a epic sieges .
well , unfortunately , we &apos;re looking at this face in real life when we face hard problems .
i call it the &quot; in life &quot; in life , and it &apos;s actually my face , you see ? yes ? ok . ok .
i &apos;m like , &quot; in life i &apos;m bad . &quot;
this is a graffiti in my former home in berkeley , california , where i studied in my ph.d. of work , we &apos;re better than in the real life .
this is a problem that many players have .
we think we &apos;re not as good in reality .
and i don &apos;t just mean less , even though that &apos;s listening .
we do more in play worlds . i mean good in the context with motivation , something significant to do with collaboration .
if we are in a game , i believe that a lot of us will turn into our best version , anytime and immediately , are willing to try to solve the problem as long as necessary , so long as necessary , it &apos;s going to try to do it again .
and in reality , if we &apos;re failing , we &apos;re often feeling different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel defeated . we feel threatened , maybe depressed , frustrated or cynian .
these feelings have never , when we play games , there &apos;s just nothing in play .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to do as a graduate student .
why is it impossible to think , you know , you can &apos;t just do anything ?
how can we transfer these feelings into reality ?
so i looked at games like the world of warcraft , which offers the ideal environment to solve a collaborative problem .
and i &apos;ve noticed some of the things that epic wins in online worlds do .
so , first of all , if you get in one of these online games , especially in the world of warcraft , there &apos;s a lot of different characters that are willing to trust you a world-end mission , instantly .
but not just any mission , but a mission that fits perfectly to your level level in the game , right ?
so they create that .
you never get a job that you can &apos;t solve .
but always on the edge of their capabilities , so they have to do better , but there &apos;s no unemployment in the world of warcraft .
you don &apos;t sit around , and you turn around . there &apos;s always something important to do .
and there are clubs .
where they go , hundreds of thousands of people who collaborate with them to finish their epic mission .
we don &apos;t have that in real life , that feeling that in a fingerprints , employees are willing to be prepared .
and then there &apos;s this epic story , this inspirational story , why we are there and what we have to do .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
you &apos;ve heard of &quot; level high , &quot; and &quot; + 1 , &quot; or &quot; + 1 intelligence . &quot;
this constant feedback is not in real life .
if i leave this stage , i didn &apos;t say , + 1 , and + 1 crazy idea , plus 20 crazy idea .
i don &apos;t get in the real life of this feedback .
so the problem of cooperative worlds like world of warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying to stand at any edge of an epic sieges , that we would rather spend our whole time in this game worlds .
they &apos;re just better than reality .
so far , all the world of warodplans have spent 5.93 million years of trying to solve the virtual problems of azeroth .
that &apos;s not necessarily something bad .
it may sound nasty .
but to see it in context , 5.93 million years ago , our first primate ancestors began to go upright .
so the first exciting primate .
ok , so if we talk about how much time we spend with play , it just makes sense when you think about the scale of the human development mind , what &apos;s extreme .
but also , because it turns out that by using these whole time , we actually change what we are as people in the situation .
we &apos;re developing us to collaborative , extraordinary creatures .
that &apos;s the truth . i believe .
if you look at these interesting statistics that have been published recently by a researcher of carnegie mellon university , the average young person of today has been spending 10,000 hours of play in a country with tremendous play to the 21st century years .
so , 10,000 hours is a very interesting number for two reasons .
first of all , for children in the united states , 10.080 hours are the exact same thing that they spend in school , from the fifth grade to the high school -- if you don &apos;t ever miss .
so we have a complete parallel path here , where young people are learning to learn what it means to be a good player , like everything else in school .
and maybe some of you have the new book of malcolm gladwell , &quot; overboard , &quot; read .
so you know his theory of success , the theory of the success of 10,000 hours .
it &apos;s based on the great research of cognitive science that if we spend 10,000 hours with the seed study of any subject to the 21st century , we &apos;re going to be able to master .
we &apos;re going to be so good at what the most important people in the world are .
so , what we have here is a whole generation of young people who are master-player .
so the big question is , &quot; what exactly are players good ? &quot;
because if we could figure that out , we would never have experienced unprecedented human potential .
so many people have now in the world that spend at least one hour a day with online play .
these are our masterpieces player . 500 million people who are remarkably good in &quot; something . &quot;
and in the next decade , we have another billion players who are remarkably good in what they are .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
the game industry developed consoles , the energy saving and work on mobile phones , rather than the broadband internet , so players in the world , especially in india , in india , china , brazil .
you would expect a extra billion players in the next decade .
we have 1.5 billion players overall .
so i started thinking about what it is for us to do these games .
here are the four things i found . first of all , despair optimism .
ok , imagine how extreme self-motivated .
valuation optimism is the desire to do something , to master , to master , to believe that we have a hope on success .
players always believe that a epic victory is possible , and it &apos;s worth trying to do it , and it &apos;s the same .
players don &apos;t sit around .
players are masters in spiders social webs .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting research , which shows that we like people to do more after we &apos;ve been playing with them , even if they have defeated us .
the reason is that it requires a lot of trust to play with someone .
we trust that someone has spent time with us that the rules are being kept , that we have the same goal , and until the playing end .
so it allows you to grow together from binary , trust and with each other .
as a result , we build stronger social relationships .
congratulow productivity . fantastic !
you know , there &apos;s a reason why the average word of warpin players plays 22 hours a week as a sublong job .
the reason is , if we &apos;re playing , we &apos;re actually happier to work hard when we relax or nothing .
we know that as human beings , we do optimal work when we do hard work .
and players are always ready to work hard if they get the right job .
and finally , epic meaning .
players love to be part of awe of awe , to become part of awe .
here &apos;s a backline of dinformation to go back to the right light . you know all wikipedia , the biggest wiki in the world .
the second aorta of the world , with almost 80,000 posts , is the world of warcraft wiki .
five million people use it every month .
they &apos;ve added more information over the world of warcraft in the internet than any other subject in the world .
they create a epic story .
they create a epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , so these are four superpowers that lead to one outcome . players are super-powerful , hopeful individuals .
it &apos;s people who believe that they can change as a single world .
and the only problem is that you think you can change the virtual worlds , but not the real .
that &apos;s the problem i &apos;m trying to solve .
edward cainsova is a u.n. scientist .
his work is genius . he &apos;s looking at why people spend so much time , energy and money in online worlds .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re not going to be less than a mass compcket in virtual worlds and online gaming environments . &quot;
and this is an economist . so it &apos;s logical .
and he says ...
not like me -- i develop games , i &apos;m a little bit overwhelmed .
so he says that actually makes sense , because players can achieve more online worlds than in real life .
you can play in play stronger social bonds than in real life , and you get more feedback and rewards in play than in real life .
so , he says it &apos;s totally logical that players are more time in the virtual world than in the real world .
i just agree , that &apos;s logical .
but it &apos;s definitely not an optical situation .
we need to start to turn the real world into a game .
my inspiration comes from an event that &apos;s 2,500 years ago .
there are these ancient cube of sheep . you know ?
in front of this fantastic game controllers there were sheep .
and these were sort of the first of people developed toys .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the work of the ancient greek historian , you may know this story . the story about how and why games were invented .
according to herodotus &apos;s games , games , more precise games , in the kingdom of famine during famine .
there was such a big famine that the king of lydies decided that the king of lydies decided .
people were suffering . people fought .
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
so they invented , according to herodotus , the flies , and it &apos;s destroying a national strategy . one day you would eat . the next day you would play .
and they would be so immersed into the game game , because games are so fascinating , and with satisfying , happier productivity , that they would forget that there was nothing to eat .
and then the next day you would play . and the next day you would eat food .
and according to herodotus , they survived this famine for 18 years by eating on a day and playing the next .
so , i think we &apos;re going to play games today .
we &apos;re meeting games to escape the world &apos;s real world .
we put games in order to make everything that doesn &apos;t work in the real world , everything in real life doesn &apos;t interfere , and we &apos;re bringing ourselves out of play .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
that &apos;s the exciting thing .
and in the past of herodotus , after 18 years , famine was not better , so the king decided to put a final game .
they shared the kingdom in two camps .
they were playing a string game and they were allowed to break into a epic adventure .
they dropped , and they were looking for the search for a new home , and they just just got so many people back , like there was food to survive and looking for the rest of a place where they were able to flourish .
that sounds crazy , right ?
but the latest dna evidence shows that the etrus , which is later the roman empire , the same dna as the old lydiese sees .
so scientists came up with the notion that ododotus was actually wrong .
and geologists found evidence of a global disconnect that took almost 20 years , which could explain famine .
so this crazy story could agree .
maybe you actually saved your people by playing by playing 18 years in games for 18 years , and then they had these objections and so much about learning that they have saved the entire civilization .
so , we can .
we &apos;ve been playing it since 1994 .
this was the first strategy in real time in real time in the world of warcratinkering series , which was 16 years ago .
they were playing for 18 years games , we &apos;ve been playing warcraft for 16 years .
i think we &apos;re ready for our own epic game .
so , they sent half of their civilization to search for a new world , so i &apos;m going to take my 21 billion hours a week .
we should have overincome that half of us spend an hour a day with play , until we &apos;ve solved the problems of the real world .
i know you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; how do we solve problems in the real world ? &quot; and that &apos;s exactly what i have my work in the last few years at the institute for the future .
we have this banner in our office in palo alto , which is how we should understand the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to tell the future before .
what we want is to create the future .
we want to think of the best outcome , and then people get powerful to the reality .
we &apos;re going to imagine epailation and giving people the opportunity to reach them .
i &apos;m going to show you a little bit about three games that i designed to try to bring people in their own future .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
the game is from 2007 .
it &apos;s an online game where you have to overcome an oil shortage .
the oil , if there &apos;s a real life , but we have enough online content for them to be realistic , and they actually live their real life without oil . so , if they get to the game , they have to tell us how much oil is , and they &apos;re going to be able to get out of their real lives , and they &apos;re going to be able to have the kind of thing that they have , and they &apos;re going to have to be able to have the kind of thing that &apos;s
we &apos;ve tested this game with 1,700 players in 2007 , and we &apos;ve accompanied them since the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was a transformative experience .
nobody wants to change his life because it &apos;s good for the environment or because we should .
but if you &apos;re in a epic adventure , and you say , &quot; we &apos;re going to get the oil . &quot;
this is an amazing adventure that you go to .
find out how they were going to survive . most of our players have the habits in the game .
so for the next world world game , we have a bigger , higher goal than just oil scarcity .
we &apos;ve developed the game &quot; superstruct &quot; at the institute for the future .
so the computation of a supercomputer is that the people only have 23 years left on the planet .
this supercomputer is called &quot; global dismortal , &quot; sensitivity system , of course .
the call to a player , and we &apos;ve designed almost like a jerry bruckic film .
you know jerry bruckheimer-movies , where there &apos;s the gaam-team . they have the astronauts , the scientists , the ex-prisoners and only together they can save the world .
but in our game , instead of just five people , we say , everyone is in the dream-team , and it &apos;s our job , the future for energy , food , security , security and the future of social justice .
8,000 players played the game for eight weeks .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that they can read when they &quot; superstruct &quot; google .
and the last game we get on the third is march three . it &apos;s a game in collaboration with the world bank .
if you finish the game , you get the world bank , &quot; social recurrage , &quot; by 2010 .
we &apos;re working with universities in a total sub-saharan africa and store to learn to innovate .
we have a comic book . we have &quot; level high for regional understanding , knowledge of knowledge , sustainability , vision and imagination .
i want to invite you all to share this game with young people , all over the world , especially in developmental areas that benefit from that , to get their own social enterprise to save the world .
i come to the end .
i want to ask you something .
what do you think happens next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t rescued the world yet .
well , i hope that you agree with me that players are human resources that we can apply to work in real life , and that games have a great meaning for change .
we have this whole superpowers , happy productivity , the ability to move close social networks , despair optimism and desire for epic meaning .
i really hope that we play great games together to survive on this planet .
and i hope you &apos;ll design with me and play with me .
if i look at the next decade , i &apos;m sure that we can create every conceivable future , and that we can play all kinds of games .
so i say , let &apos;s start the world changing games !
thank you .
i &apos;d like to tell you a little bit about what happened to me a couple of months ago in writing of a computational article .
i always have prepared my synonyian dictionary in writing , but i was able to work with the texture of the text , and i noticed that i &apos;ve never recovered in my life what the word &quot; disabled &quot; really means .
i read to you the post .
&quot; disabled , &quot; adjective , &quot; arrest , useless , untapped , muwed , muwed , muffed , muffed , screwed , hiwed , unpotent , impotent , impotent , imprised , imprised , imprised , imprised , impoverished , unstopped , unstopped , impoverished , sleemed .
antonyme : healthy , powerful , powerful . &quot;
i &apos;ve read this list of a friend according to a friend , and i had to laugh , it was so ridiculous , but i just came up to the &quot; seeding &quot; and i couldn &apos;t get to talk to you , and i had to start to collect and start to collect that kind of mess of emotional shock .
of course , this was a whoest , old synonyian dictionary . i just thought that the copy must be pretty old .
but in fact , it was a copy on the early 1980s when i started with the elementary school and started to build my self-image outside of my family , and to form , even in terms of other children and the rest around me .
and thank god i didn &apos;t use a synonyian dictionary .
if i would take this post seriously , i would be born into a world that someone like me would perceive as one person , whose life could run positive in the same way , but today i &apos;m going to be a chance and adventure that i &apos;ve experienced .
so i immediately figured out the online issue of 2009 , and i would expect that i &apos;m going to find a plug here .
here &apos;s the current version of this one-to-one yield .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
in particular , the last two words , the last two words , are under &quot; close antony &quot; and &quot; close . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just the words .
it &apos;s about what we think about the people we describe with these words .
it &apos;s about the values that put in these words , and how we construct these values .
our language affects our thinking and how we see the world around us .
a lot of ancient societies , including the greeks and the roman , really believed that the language of a garden has a huge force , because what you &apos;re talking about can also manifest .
so what do we really want to manifest -- a disabled person or a powerful human ?
for a human being alone , an eight-dollar child could be able to seize them , and give them access to them .
wouldn &apos;t it be beautiful to open their doors ?
a man who opened up my doors was my pediatrician at the a.i. dupont institute in wild .
he &apos;s called dr. pizeintillo . italo-american , whose name , as you can think , couldn &apos;t talk to most americans . so he &apos;s always called dr. p. .
and dr. p. used to fly very colorful and was just for work with kids .
i found the time that i spent in this hospital just great -- to my physiological therapy .
i had to think of it as an infinitely often often connected to these thick , elastic bchanges -- in different colors -- you know , to build my leg muscles , and i hated these tape more than anything . i hated them . i hated them . i hated them .
and imagine , even when i was a five-year-old child with dr. p. verbeing , and so trying to stop these exercises , natural leller without success .
and one day he looked at me at one of my work -- these exercises were just tiring and grace -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re such a strong , powerful and young girl , you &apos;re going to cut one day of one of these bands .
and if you make it , i give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
that was just a simple trick of dr. p. , so i &apos;m doing the work that i didn &apos;t want to do with the prospect that the richest five-year-old girl in the hospital is going to be in the second floor , but he actually got me to see my own everyday horror .
and i &apos;m asking myself today how much his vision of me as a strong and powerful young girl shaped my self-image , and i could imagine myself as a nature of strong , powerful and breathing man .
this is just one example of many , like adults in power positions can leverage the imagination of a child .
but what the examples of the synonyian dictionaries show us is that our language doesn &apos;t have a space to imagine what we all would like to do : to allow each individual to see themselves as powerful people .
our language is following the social changes that were caused in many cases through a technological change .
from the medical point of view , you can tell , of course , that my legs , the laser surgery for visual disabilities , cupcuke from titan and artificial hatches for aging bodies that allow people to be able to pick up their own identity , is to be able to define their own identity .
so perhaps , this technological change is more true because , ever , there &apos;s always a different truth , which is that every human being is something special and very powerful , and that the human ability to adapt to our biggest plus is our biggest one .
the human ability to adapt -- this is an interesting story , because people are always asking me to say , how do i deal with widridities and i &apos;m going to have something like that , and i &apos;ve always felt very uncomfortable to answer the people , and i &apos;ve always felt very uncomfortable to answer why .
this sentence of the deal with widricies lives from the idea that success depends on it , and it depends on a challenge to master , without being able to be shaped by this experience , as if my life would be so successful , as if my life was so successful .
but the truth is that we &apos;re changing . of course , we &apos;re shaped by the challenge , whether it &apos;s physically , emotionally or even both .
and i &apos;m suggesting that it &apos;s good .
now , widritia is not an obstacle that we have to get around to get to our lives better .
widrities are just to our lives .
and i &apos;m running to see widricies as my shadow .
sometimes i know that he &apos;s very present , sometimes he &apos;s hardly to see , but he &apos;s constantly at me .
and i don &apos;t want to have the impact whatsoever , or the heavy of a man &apos;s .
in life , there &apos;s widrition and challenges , and these are just everyday and every person is going to do it differently , but the question is not whether we can get to widricies or not , as we can get .
so we &apos;re not just responsible for keeping people who we love , and they &apos;re also preparing to come well .
and we don &apos;t like our kids when we give them the feeling that they cannot adapt .
you have to separate two things : to be a medical fact , to be amputated and to the other social think about whether i &apos;m disabled or not .
and to be honest , the only real and fulfilling disability that i had to take away from , is that the world is constantly , you can describe me with these definitions .
in our desire to protect people who are on heart and to tell them the cool , hard truth about their medical projections , or even a projection to the quality of life that they expect , we have to pay attention to the fact that we actually have to be disabled .
maybe this is the present concept , which is just paying attention to what &apos;s in a broken , and how we repair it , for every one of them a larger disability than the pathology .
if we don &apos;t treat a human being , and not all of his forces and possibilities and possibilities , we create in addition to the natural fight that you might have to lead , another disease .
we have a people who have value for our society .
so we have to look beyond the patology and focus on all the human possibilities .
but most importantly , it &apos;s between perception of our error and our great imagination , a connection .
we should not disvalue these challenging times or deny , we shouldn &apos;t try to avoid them , we should be able to avoid them under the carpet , but it &apos;s about finding opportunities in the dridrities .
it may be more important to me to make sure that we don &apos;t necessarily have to get over it , but that we are open to the hug , to put them on the sopf , and maybe even dance with it .
and maybe we can do it as a kind of natural , consistent and useful and useful to see ourselves through their presence of the presence .
in this year , we celebrate the 200 . birthday of charles darwin and when he wrote about evolution 150 years ago , darwin , in my eyes , showed up to something very true in the human character .
i would write it like this : not the most powerful of its kind survived , and not the most intelligent of its kind , but the one that can adapt to the best .
it comes out of conflicts .
not only from darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability of the people , to survive and to flourish , is defined by conflict .
so , again , change and adaptation are the greatest skills of people .
and maybe we just know what wood we &apos;re cutting out of when we &apos;re really tested .
maybe that &apos;s exactly the meaning of widrities , a sense of music , a sense of our own power .
we can give ourselves something like this .
we can give people a new meaning that goes beyond severe times .
maybe we can see ourselves as a change .
widrities are for change that we haven &apos;t yet adapted to .
i think the biggest damage we &apos;ve added ourselves is to believe that we should be normal .
well , who &apos;s normal ?
there &apos;s no normal .
there are the usual . the typical . but not the normal . and would you really want to know that poor , gray person , if you really would have ?
i think rather not .
it would be great if we think of the paradigm of normality against another one of the possibilities , or the strength , in fact , to give it a little more dangerous , we could replace the forces of very many children , and invite them to bring their very special and valuable ability to society .
negroponte polgen found that we have people from the members of our society always : to be useful and to afford a contribution .
there are evidence that , already , the neanderthals come back 60,000 years ago , and people with severe physical injuries , and that might happen , because life experience in survival was valuable .
they don &apos;t have these people as broken and useless ; they were treated as something special and valuable .
a few years ago , i went in the city where i grew up in a food market in that red zone in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i stood there a spispiel totoes .
it was summer and i had hawts .
and i hear a guy behind me saying , &quot; well , if that &apos;s not aimee mullins . &quot;
and i turn around and i see these older man . i had no idea who he is .
and i said , &quot; sorry , sir , we know ? i can &apos;t remember them . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , you might barely remember me .
when i first saw her , i brought her out of her mother &apos;s belly . &quot;
oh , so that .
and then , of course , it did click .
this was dr. kean , a man i knew only about stories of my mother about this day , because i , of course , to late my birthday two weeks later .
the doctor for prots diagnosed my mother was in vacation , and so my parents had the man who brought me to the world at all .
and because i was born with no wag legs , and my feet were looking for them , and i only had a few toes on this and a few toes on the other foot , and he had a few toes on the other foot .
he said to me , &quot; i had to tell your parents that you would never walk , and never going to be like other children , or you could never have an independent life , and they &apos;ve been just lying to me . &quot;
it was really extraordinary to me that he had collected the newspaper of my entire childhood , no matter whether i had written in a letter competition in the second class , whether i had to climb with the pathways on the parade , whether i had my scholarship , to teach the students , medical students from the hah-medical school .
and he called this part of the x factor , which is the potential of the human being .
you can &apos;t emphasize enough how significant this factor can be of a human quality of life .
and dr. kean mentioned , he said , &quot; i &apos;ve learned that kids , if they don &apos;t always get something else , and even if they get a little bit of support , then they can get kids a lot . &quot;
see , dr. kean has changed his thinking .
he understood that the medical diagnosis , and how somebody can deal with it , are two different things .
and also , i &apos;ve changed in the course of time when they had asked me at the age of 15 , whether i had my prostheses against meat and bones , then i wouldn &apos;t have been shy .
i was really interested in normal .
if you ask me that today , i &apos;m not so sure .
and that &apos;s because i &apos;ve experienced something with my legs and not despite that experience .
and maybe this change could happen because i &apos;ve seen so many people who have opened doors to me , instead of looking at people who are restricting me or a notion of that .
see , it really just takes one person to show you how they can manifest their forces , and they &apos;re through .
if you allow somebody to be able to activate your own , inner powers -- the human mind is so reloaded -- if you can , and for somebody in a critical moment , they &apos;re a very good teacher .
they bring them to open their doors .
the real meaning of the word &quot; eduardo &quot; in the word &quot; eduardo . &quot;
it means something creates that in one is to tickle the potential .
again , what do we want to do ?
in the &apos; 60s , in the u.k. , there was an emergency study done in the u.k. then .
they call this &quot; arrest , &quot; in the united states , we call it &quot; tracking . &quot;
students are sent to grades .
and the a student will test coins harder to get the better teachers .
they then gave over a three-month period of students with a &quot; well &quot; -- &quot; the grade &quot; very well . it was told that they were out , they were very smart , and they really wrote up .
and of course , it breaks out to hear the heart that the other students were told , they &apos;re just sufficient .
and then it was after the three months .
but only those who are still in school -- except from the students who made the school .
very crucial at this study , the teachers were not covered .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
they were just told that they are the students and they are the students with the grade , and they &apos;ve taught them something , and they &apos;re being treated .
the only real disability is a broken mind , which has been broken , has no hope of hope . he doesn &apos;t find anything more beautiful . he lacks our natural , child thinking , and our innate ability of imagination .
but if we manage to support the human mind , to hope , to hope , to find yourself and other people around themselves , and then be curious , and then to be more powerful , and then we &apos;re putting our forces a really positive one .
if a mind has about these qualities , we can create a new reality and new forms .
i &apos;d like to end with a poem that was written by an persian poar called hafiz in 14th centuries , and my friend jacques gave it to me , and the poem is called &quot; the god , who knows only four words , not the god of the names , &quot; &quot; every child knows it , not the god of the name , &quot; and the god who knows only four words , and he &apos;s always going to tell the god .
come on , dance with me . thank you .
how would you be better than you are right now ?
suppose i said that through a few changes of their genes , a better memory could have -- more precise and faster .
or want to be a fitter , stronger , more force .
do you want to become attractive and more confident ?
how would it be to live on good health ?
or maybe they &apos;re one of those who always has more creativity .
which one would you like most ?
which one would you like to have if you could only have one ?
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see .
a few . probably as many as the creative people there are .
that &apos;s very good .
how many would they choose for a good memory ?
a couple more .
how about fitness ?
a few less .
what about longevity ?
ah , the majority . i like to see the lars as a doctor .
if you could only have one of those , it would be a very different world .
is it all about education ?
or is it possible ?
evolution is a ongoing issue here on the ted conference , but today i want to give you the idea of a doctor &apos;s point .
the great geneticists in the 20th century , t. gs dobzhan sky , who was also a communist in the russian orthodox church , once wrote an essay called &quot; nothing in biology . &quot;
now , if you &apos;re one of those , which is not the evidence for the biological evolution , that would be a very good time to switch your hearing , take your personal communication device -- i &apos;ll give you the permission -- and maybe you can take a look at kathryn schultz &apos;s book , which is why it &apos;s not going to be a matter of that talk .
but if you accept biological evolution , what do you think is the past , or is it just about the future ?
is it possible for others to do it ?
this is another look at the tree of life .
in this picture , i put a bush as a center of the branches in all directions , because if you look at the edges of the tree of life , all the existing specicies of these branches have been in evolutionary terms , in evolutionary terms , they have survived ; it has survived ; it &apos;s got their environment .
the human part of this book , far at the end , is , of course , what we &apos;re most interested in .
we &apos;re talking about a shared ancestor of modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago .
in this period , maybe there were 20 or 25 different species of hominids .
some are come and went .
we &apos;ve been here for about 130,000 years .
it seems like we &apos;re quite remote from the other parts of the building , but actually the biggest part , the fundamental mechanisms of our cells are quite equal .
it &apos;s clear that we can use it , and the mechanisms of a common bacteria can absorb to produce the protein of the human insulin , which is used to treat diabetic ?
this is not like humaninsulin ; this is the same protein that &apos;s the same protein that comes from the crecreas .
and as we talk about bacteria , you realize that every one of us in our gut has more bacteria than it is in the rest of our body ?
maybe 10 times .
i mean , do you think when antonio damasio asks her self-portrait , think about the bacteria ?
our gut is a wonderful hospitous environment for these bacteria .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s hot , it &apos;s very vegetable .
and you &apos;re all going to give you all the nutrients that you would just want to spend without effort .
it &apos;s really a lighter way of the bacteria , with occasiental subpontions of the unintended , jeodch forced shock to the outcome .
but otherwise they &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria , just as they are important for their lives .
they help the digestion of essential nutrients , and they protect them against certain diseases .
but what will happen in the future ?
are we in a form of evolutionary equilibrium in a species ?
or are we determined to become something else -- something that might be adapted to the environment ?
now let &apos;s take a step back to the time of the big bang 14 trillion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years ago -- the first signs of living , perhaps three to four billion years ago -- and then the human species , in the last 130,000 years , in the last 130,000 years .
in this vast uncrowded symphony of the universe , life on earth is only just briefly measuring ; the animal kingdom , like a single tab , and the human life , a small piece of music .
we were .
this also shows the entertainment value of this speech , which is why i hope you like it .
well , when i was in college , i had my first biology classes .
i was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology .
i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i realized something very fundamental : in most of the existence of life in individual organisms , each cell , and all the genetic information of the cell will continue .
but at the time , as a multi-fold organisms began to change things .
sexual reproduction goes into the picture .
and most importantly , with the introduction of sexual reproduction that &apos;s going to keep the genome on , the rest of the body is empowered .
in fact , you might say that the inevitable of the death of the death of our bodies is going to happen in the same moment as the sexual reproduction .
now i &apos;ve got to say , if i was a college student , i thought , okay , sex / death , sex / death , death for sex -- it seemed to be pretty reasonable , but with every year , it has come to my survival challenge .
i &apos;ve come to understand the feelings of george burns , who in las vegas wrote his show in the &apos; 90s .
and one night , there &apos;s a pat in his hotel room .
he opens the door .
in front of him , there &apos;s a very beautiful thing to do .
she looks at him and she says , &quot; i &apos;m here for super-sex sex . &quot;
&quot; this is wonderful , &quot; says george , &quot; i &apos;m going to take soup . &quot;
i came to the realization as a doctor i was working on a goal when the goal of evolution -- not necessarily inflambrous , just different .
i tried to preserve the body .
i wanted to keep ourselves healthy .
i wanted to recreate health after a disease .
i wanted us to have a long and healthy life .
evolution is all about the recore of the genome to the next generation , adaptation and survival generation .
from an evolutionary standpoint , they are , and i developed like booster rockets to send the genetic question into the next level of orbit , and then fall into the ocean .
i think we would all be able to understand the hody , the woody all to the expression when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to be immortality by my work .
i want to do it by not dying . &quot;
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily mean the longest life .
it doesn &apos;t necessarily include the biggest , the most talented or the fastest , and not even the smartest .
evolution numb the creatures who are the best in their environment .
it &apos;s only the test of survival and success .
on the bottom of the ocean , bacteria are there , which are thermophihil , and by the means of the &quot; damoise , &quot; if fish were there , it would have a habitable fish for itself .
so , what does that mean when we look back at what &apos;s happening in evolution , and how we think about the space of people in evolution , and especially how we look at the next phase , i would say it &apos;s a series of options .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to move forward .
we have a kind of balance .
and the reason for that would be that , first of all , in medicine , we &apos;ve been able to get a lot of genes that would have been otherwise chosen and from the population .
and secondly , we as a spezie have our environment so that we managed to adapt to it , and we adapt to them .
and by the way , we go around and we mix and mix it so much that you can &apos;t say that isolation is necessary for evolution to find out .
a second possibility is that it will be evolution of traditional way , of course , of the forces of nature .
and the argument here is that there would be the wheels of evolution slowly , but they &apos;re inambiguous .
and so far the isolation is being defeated as a species of planets , it becomes isolated and the changes of the environment that could produce evolution in natural ways .
but there &apos;s a third possibility , a tempting , fascinating and terrifying opportunity .
i call it neo-evolution -- the new development that doesn &apos;t just , of course , but decided and decided , as an individual , in the decisions that we make .
now , how could that happen ?
how could it be possible that we do this ?
let &apos;s first look at the reality that people today are making decisions about their offspring .
they are , in some cultures , the choice to have more men than women .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family will choose .
so think of , if it wasn &apos;t just possible to choose the gender of your child , but also , you know , to make a decision to influence the body that cure disease and prevent disease .
what if you could make the genetic changes to remove diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s disease or eliminating the cancer risk ?
would you not want to do it , these changes in your genes ?
if we look forward , these kinds of changes will be increasingly possible .
the human genome project started in 1990 , and it took 13 years .
it cost 2.7 billion dollars .
in the following year , when it was done in 2004 , they could do the same for 20 million dollars in drises .
today you can have a sequence of three billion base pairs of the human genome to a price of about $ 20,000 and in the space of about a week .
it &apos;s not going to take long , until the reality will be that it will be $ 1,000 human genomes , and it will be increasingly available for everybody .
a week ago , the national academy of engineering the national academy of engineering , the draper prize for francis arnold and wilsty stemmers , is two scientists who developed the techniques of the evolution of evolution to be able to do the natural process of evolution in a more efficient way .
a few years ago , the roman prize of scientists was boranya yamanaka for his research in which he took an adult risk , a fibroosten , and through the manipulation of just four genes in your body -- a cell could be able to bring it back to a pluripotent cell .
these changes are coming in .
the same technology that can make the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not just protection itself , but can also serve the immunity against other viruses .
whether you believe it or not , it &apos;s an experimental study in the gang with a vaccine that has been built in the cells of a spreactic plant .
can you imagine something good that comes from tobacco ?
this is all reality today and the future will be much more possible .
so just imagine two other little changes .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change your cells ?
what if you could change the sperm and cells , or the fresh egg , to make your kids a better chance for a healthier life -- eliminating diabetes , reduce the risk of cancer ?
who don &apos;t want healthier children ?
and then the analytic technology , the same engine that allows the change to allow the changes to prevent disease , could also enable us to adopt , say , superintendent .
why don &apos;t we have the capacity of a ken jennings , especially if you can extend it with the next generation of the watt-machine ?
why not the fast muscle fibers that will allow them to run faster and longer ?
why not live longer ?
these are being inconsistent .
and if we &apos;re on a place where we can put it on the next generation , and we can use the attributes that we want to be transformed by the alo-style evolution .
we &apos;re going to have a process that requires the rule of 100,000 years , and we can use it in a thousand years -- and maybe even the next 100 years .
these are decisions associated with their grandchildren , or their grandchildren , to deal with .
we use these decisions to create a society that &apos;s better , which is more successful ?
or are we going to choose selectively different attributes that we want for some of us and not for others ?
are we going to be a society of dielangly and unidents , or more robust and diverse ?
these are the types of questions we need to be facing .
and at the lowest of all , will we ever be able to develop the wisdom , and the wisdom we need to make these decisions ?
in the good way in evil , and once you think , these decisions are going to be on us .
thank you .
i want you to imagine a little bit now , a portable robot that gives you overhuman skill , or a different one who helps to go up and go up .
in berkeley , we call these robots exotic skeletons .
they &apos;re not different than something they put in the morning and gives them additional strength and increase their velocity , and that will help them keep their balance .
this is actually the real loss of human and machine .
but not only that -- in order to connect and connect with the universe and other devices out there .
it &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
now to show you what we &apos;re working on , we start talking about the american soldiers in the united states , which carries about 100 pounds on its back and it &apos;s the question that you should carry more equipment .
of course , this leads to some major complications -- spinal injuries , 30 percent of it -- chronic injuries .
so we thought we would take this challenge and create an exotic skeleton that would help deal with this problem .
so let me introduce you now to pic -- or the human universal fragment .
soldier : with the hulc exotic skeleton , i can carry 200 pounds above all kinds of things , many hours long .
his flexible design allows it to go down deep , to lead to leaders and highly recyclable movements .
it feels what i want to do , where i want to go and increase my strength and balance .
we are so far , with our industrial partners this device , this new exotic skeleton in this year .
so it &apos;s true .
now let &apos;s look at our look at the rolling drivers , something that i &apos;m particularly passionate about .
there are 68 million people competing around the wheelchair .
that &apos;s about one percent of the population .
and that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate .
we &apos;re often talking about very young people with spinal cord injuries that live in the blooms of their lives -- 201 , &apos; 40s -- and the wheelchair is the only option .
but it &apos;s also about aging population , which is the number of copies .
and so pretty much the only option -- if it comes to a brain beat , or other complications -- is the wheelchair .
and so , by the way , it &apos;s been 500 years since , like i &apos;ve got to say , very successful introduction .
so we thought we could start writing a completely new chapter in the area of mobility .
now let me introduce to you now , which is being carried by amanda boxtel , who suffered a spinal cord injury back to the result that they had no longer to walk since 19 years and now .
thank you .
as i said , amanda carries our elegangs .
it has sensors .
his completely non-invasive sensors in the crtches , sending back signals back to our onboard computer , which is attached to her back .
and here are the root packets , the motor engine is on their hip , as well as their cupons , which they move forward in this pretty smooth and very natural way .
i was 24 years old , and in best form , as a moncket tree while a ski tree took me off .
in a fraction of a second , i lost every feeling and every move underneath my beckens .
not long after that , a doctor in my hospital and he said , &quot; amanda , you &apos;ll never go again . &quot;
and that was 19 years ago .
it &apos;s steel every five hope from my consciousness .
adaptable technologies have been able to learn to learn to drive again , to climb , climb and even ride with the hands .
but nothing was invented to let me go back to that .
thank you .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to meet and argue with them .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we have all the potential here to change the life of future generations -- not just for the soldiers , or for amanda here and all of them .
thank you .
at home in new york , i &apos;m the head of development department of a non-profit organization called robin hood .
if i do not meet poverty , i fought as a fireman &apos;s chief man at a volunteer , the fire .
well , in our city , in volunteers , a highly educated professional department , you have to be pretty early at the heart of scratch .
i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunteer of the fire , so i had really good opportunity to get there .
but it was still one of the other volunteers to get to the other volunteers , to try to figure out what our tasks would be .
when i found the main man , he was in a very serious conversation with the janitors who certainly had one of the worst days of their life .
it was in the middle of the night , and she was in the beating train and she was under a screen in the shallow rain , while her house stood in flames .
the other volunteers that arrived in front of me -- we call him lex bieners -- reached the main man first and became asked to go to the house and save the dog of the janitors .
the dog ! i was in front of memory .
there was some lawyer , or wealth , which is now for the rest of his life , telling people that he went to a burning in the house to save a living thing , just because he was five seconds faster than i was .
well , i was the next one .
the main man winding me .
he said , &quot; calis , you have to go to the house .
you have to go up to the top of the fire , and you have to get this woman a few shoes . &quot;
i swear .
well , not exactly what i hope i had , but i went to -- the trebs up the hallway , the &quot; real firemen , &quot; in the &quot; real firemen , &quot; at that moment , to get a few shoes .
i know what you &apos;re thinking , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i was wearing my prey down to the bottom , where i got to my front door and met my loved dog .
we put our claims out to the janitors , where , not surprisingly , of his much more attention than mine .
a few weeks later , the department of the department was a letter of the janitors in which they were in rescue for their house .
one of the things that struck kindness : somebody was actually carrying a pair of shoes .
in my job , at robin hood , and in my side profession as voluntary sunam , i &apos;m witness to generosity and kindness in the big scale , but i also see the charity and the muts of individual .
and you know what i &apos;ve learned ?
they &apos;re all important .
so when i look around in this room , and you see people who have either come to succeed , or on their way , i want to offer memory : wait , don &apos;t wait .
don &apos;t wait to make a difference in the life of another , until you &apos;ve reached your first million .
if you have something to give it , now you give it .
they put in a grocery kitchen , they put a park in the neighborhood .
be a mentor .
not every day will give us an opportunity to save people &apos;s lives , but every day offers us to change one .
so they go ; save the shoes .
thank you .
bruno guissani : mark , come back .
thank you .
i &apos;m just coming back from a community that knows the secret of humanity &apos;s population .
a place where women lead the zepter , with sex , and the game determines -- where fun is a serious matter .
and no , it &apos;s not helpless or san francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , their relationships .
this is the world of wild bonobos in the congo forest of congo .
bonobos are together with chimpanzees our next living relatives .
that means we have a common ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother , that lived about six million years ago .
well , chimpanzees are known for their aggressive vidity .
but unfortunately , we overstated this issue in the narrative of human evolution .
but bonobos tell us the other side of the coin .
and as chimpanzees of great , violent kerers are led to the feminine society of empowerment .
they have really come up with something , because that leads to a very highly tolerance society in the deadly violence .
but unfortunately , bonobos are least known among the primates .
they live in the deep of the conventions of congo , and they &apos;re just hard to do .
congo is a paradox -- a country extraordinary biodiversity , and beauty , but also the heart of the darkness itself -- the scene of a violent debate that has been tended for decades and passed so many lives as the first world war .
it doesn &apos;t surprise that these destruction also survive .
meat trade and the decline of the tree of the tree is that you could not even fill a stadium with the ones -- and you &apos;re not sure to be honest .
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a hidden laugh that the trees burst .
who are these relative ?
we know them as &quot; love instead of war &quot; monkeys , because they have a common , bexual sex , with interacting partners , and rules like that and social angelies .
i &apos;m not saying that that would be the answer to all the humanitarian problems -- because life &apos;s life is made out of more than the camel .
bonobos -- like humans -- love to play their lives long .
play is not just children &apos;s games .
for us and it &apos;s fundamental for the bond of relationships and the care of tolerance .
we &apos;re learning trust and the rules of the game .
game increases creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s all about creating diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity of behaviors , diversity of connections .
and if you look at bonobos in play , you see the evolutionary origins of human labs , dance and rituals .
play is the tickle that stops us .
well , i don &apos;t know how they play , but i want to show you some unique footage from the wild .
first of all , a ballgame -- and i don &apos;t think of it in football .
so here we see a young female and males in a tracking game .
look at what she &apos;s doing .
this could be the evolutionary origin of : &quot; she runs him in the eggs . &quot;
just that i think it &apos;s more like him , not true .
yeah !
so sex games are spread , both of bonobos and people .
and this video is really interesting , because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows the ideological , with which you bring new elements to the game -- like the tecals and also how the game works both , as it does , as it is , as well as it is .
but the game is a gyrus .
play is a formal , and it can take a lot of forms of people who are a little quiet to some of those who are a little bit wrong , and it might be , perhaps , to discover the most amazing again .
and i want to show you , this is fusion , a young female , and she &apos;s playing peace with water .
i think exactly what you &apos;re playing , sometimes , and we &apos;re looking at the limitations of our inner and outer worlds .
and it &apos;s these playful curiosity that makes us research , and interact with it , and the unexpected iterations that we create is the real nature of creativity .
this is just a little taste of the insights that bonobos give us in our past and present .
but they also have a secret for our future , a future where we need to adapt to existing challenges through larger creativity and prints .
the secret is that the game is the key to these skills .
in other words , play is our adayoker .
so to adapt to a very consistent world , we need to play .
but are we going to make the best of our play drive ?
play is not silly .
it &apos;s essential .
for bonobos and people equally , life isn &apos;t from teeth and claws alone .
just if it &apos;s hardly appropriate , maybe play is at the most accurate .
and so , my commamates , let &apos;s embrace this gift of evolution and play together while we &apos;re doing the creativity of the camership and the wonder again .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two pairs , middle 1979 , exactly the same day , exactly the same moment , every single one -- okay .
so two pairs , each one is a baby .
now i don &apos;t want you to take a lot of time to imagine , because if you take the whole time , you won &apos;t listen to me .
imagine that just for a moment .
and in this scenario , they imagine that in a case that &apos;s a y chomomatic , which hits the x chromosome of the ice cell .
and in the other case , the bema carries a x chromosome that hits the x chromosome on the x of the ice .
both of them are free , both light .
we come back to these people later .
in most of my activities , i have two hatches .
under a hat , i &apos;m working with the story of anatomy .
i &apos;m an historian , and in this case , i study how people went back with anatomy -- that human body , animal bodies -- how they went with body fluids -- how they thought about body .
the other hat i carried in my work is the activist , as patients -- or as i say , sometimes impatients -- of people who are the patients of physicians .
in this case , i &apos;ve been working with people who have the bodies , the social norms in question .
so , for example , i worked with people who are siamesan twins , two people in a body .
i grew up working with zwarf -- so people who were smaller than common .
and very often , i &apos;ve been working with intersexual people whose gender is breathing -- so people who don &apos;t have the average male or female type of bodies .
and as general , we can use the word intersexuality .
intersexuality comes in many different forms .
i &apos;m just going to give you a few examples of the possible types of gender , which is not the male or a female standard .
in one case , you may have somebody with a fax base , and the y chomosoms leaves the protocell that we use all the latals to grow all of the time .
and that &apos;s why the teuses are giving testosterone in the nest .
but because this individual is missing the receptors to recognize testosterone , the body doesn &apos;t react to testosterone .
and this is called androgenreceptor defect .
so much testosterone , but no reaction to that .
as a result , the body evolves more of the typical female line .
when that kid is born , she looks like a girl .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s raised as a girl .
but it takes most of the time to get the puberty and grow their breasts and develop them , but they don &apos;t get their period , until someone comes out of it .
and they do a couple of tests , and they find out that instead of using ice sticks and utera mother , it &apos;s actually tedying , and it &apos;s a y chromosome .
it &apos;s important to understand that you could actually hold this person for a male , but they &apos;re not really .
women , like men , have something in our bodies called adrenalinglsen .
they &apos;re in the back part of our body .
and the side kidneys represent the androgenic , which are virilizing hormones .
most women , like me -- i think being a typical woman -- i don &apos;t know my actual chromosomes , but i think i probably have the typical -- most women like me actually speak to androgenic .
we produce androgists and we &apos;re talking about androgenic .
the consequence is that someone like me actually has a brain that has been exposed to more androgenic than a woman who was born with tedied , and a androgen receptor defect .
so , gender is really complicated ; intersexual ones are not just in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in some ways , they can be spread across the range .
one more example : a few years ago , i received the call of a 19 year-old man , who was born as a young boy , he had a friend , had sex with his girlfriend , lived with his girlfriend , and he had just figured out that he had an ovarile and a representative mother .
he had an extreme form of an innate side of kidney cattle .
he has xx chromosome , and in the womb , his side kidneys were so powerful that they created a male hormone environment .
and as a consequence , his genines have been covered in a manly male , his brain was the goldilocks male part of the hormone spectrum .
and when he was born , he saw like a boy -- no one .
and only when he was 19 years old , he got enough medical problems , actually , because he was on the inside that the doctors found that he was in the inner man .
okay , just a quick example of an intersexual impact .
some people with xx chromosomes , they develop something that is called the ogos estis called ovarian tissue .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this is happening .
so gender can occur in many different varieties .
the reason kids with this kind of body -- it &apos;s zwarf , or siamesan twins , is that it &apos;s intersexually adapted -- surgeons often have adapted to the norm , is not because this is for their physical health benefits .
in many cases , these people are totally healthy .
the reason why you &apos;ve often had different kinds of surgical is because it &apos;s our social categories .
typically our system is based on the idea that a certain anatomic audence is associated with a certain identity .
so we have the idea of being a woman &apos;s identity to have a female identity ; a black person is meant to have an african anatomy in terms of their own history .
so we have this awful simple idea .
and if we &apos;re faced with a body that &apos;s actually something very different for us , that &apos;s what &apos;s really different to us .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas about individualism .
and our nation is really based on a very romantic concept of individualism .
now you can imagine how amazing it is when kids are born , the two people in a body .
now , where i had seen most of the excitement most of the time , the south african lyter was the last year of the day of the gender of the gharial in berlin .
many journalists called me the question : &quot; what test are you going to do , who tells us whether caster semenya female is female or male ? &quot;
and i had to explain the journalist that there aren &apos;t there .
we now know that gender is complicated enough that we have to admit that nature is not a line between male and female , or between male and intersexually and intersexually and intersexually and intersexually , we &apos;re going to make it the line of course .
so we have a situation where , the further our science continued , we need to stand around so much that these categories that we &apos;ve been spending for stable anatomic categories , which were very simple to create permanent identical circuits to create permanent identical circuits , much more attractive than we &apos;ve done .
and that &apos;s not just related to gender .
it &apos;s also about race , which turns out to be a lot more complicated than our terminology .
in our games , we &apos;ve gone into all sorts of unethical areas .
for example , we put in the fact that we have at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees .
what are we going to do with the fact that we are only different from a few nuclear tide ?
while we continue to push our science further , we get increasingly into a zone of uncomfortable , where we need to recognize that the receiver categories that we &apos;ve probably had .
we see this in all sorts of areas of human life .
one of the areas that we see in the beiise is in our modern culture today , in today &apos;s united states , are the struggle about the beginning and the end of life .
we have hard conversations about what a body is going to be for people , so it &apos;s a different kind of fetal life .
we have very hard conversations today -- maybe not as public as in medicine -- about the question when someone is dead .
our ancestors used to have really hard to deal with the question when someone was dead .
you &apos;ve just held a feather on your nose , and if you moved , you haven &apos;t buried it yet .
if you weren &apos;t moving , you &apos;re buried .
but today we &apos;re in a situation where we take people &apos;s vital organs and they want to do other people .
and as a result , we &apos;re starting to deal with the really hard question when someone is dead . and that brings us into a really difficult , in which we don &apos;t have so simple categories .
now , you might think that the whole thing could break together by categories like me really happy .
i &apos;m politically competent , i defending people with unusual bodies , but i have to admit it makes me feel nervous .
to understand that these categories are really much more insecure than we thought it was .
and it makes me tempting in terms of what democracy is about .
so to tell you about this tension , i need to first know that i &apos;m a big fan of the founding fathers .
i know they were raised , i know they were the most sexist , but they were great .
i find that they were so tallous and strong , and so radically , in what they were doing for me to look at all of the years that i &apos;ve been looking at all of the pieces of music , and it &apos;s not because of the music that &apos;s absolutely forgotten .
it &apos;s because of what happened in 1776 with the green fathers .
the founding fathers were from my view of the original anatomic activists , which is why .
what she proposed back was an anatomical concept , and they put it through another that was radical and beautiful , and 200 years for us .
as you all remember , our founding fathers the concept of monarchy , and the monarchy based on a very simplified concept of anatomy .
the people who had no concept based on the dna , but they had a concept of birth on the right .
they had a concept of blue blood .
they were the notion that people who had political power should have this political power , because of the wounded blood line of the grandfather to son and so on .
the founding fathers revolve this idea back and put it through a new anatomic concept , and this concept said that all people were being created .
they did the play field , and they decided that anatomically , anatomically , the commonalities , not the differences , and that was very radical .
now , they did this part because they were part of an educational system where two things grew up in common .
democracy grew up , but at the same time , science grew up .
if you look at the history of the green fathers , a lot of them are very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a naturalistic world .
they went away from explanations natural art , and meadows , like a natural concept of power , back where the transmission of a very massive concept of birth is based on birth .
they moved to a natural concept .
and for example , if you look at the independence of independence , you talk about nature and the god of nature .
they don &apos;t talk about god and nature .
they talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
and as part of it , they made us a concept of anatomical relativity .
and with that , they &apos;re really prepared by the future of civic rights movement .
they didn &apos;t think about it , but what they did for us was great .
so what happened after that ?
for example , women who used the vote right , the concept of greening fathers , that says that anatomical is more important than the anatomic difference , and said , &quot; that we have a uteran , and we have to have the right to have a legal , etc . &quot;
and women argued that .
next of all , the successful civil rights movement , where we saw people like soxner permanently , which is , &quot; am i not a woman ? &quot;
we find men in the droms of marine defense movement that say , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , people different skin skin , in anatomical terms of anatomical differences , again , successful .
we see the same thing with the disabled legal movement .
now , of course , the problem is that , as we begin to look at all the similarities , we have to start in question , why we maintain certain levels .
well , what i want to do now is , i want to maintain certain kinds of stresings , anatomically , in our culture .
i want to give you a fish , for example , not the same rights as a person .
i don &apos;t want to say that we should take away from anatomy .
i don &apos;t want to say that 5year-olds should have the right to get their understanding of sex or to marry .
so there are some anatomical slices that make sense to me , and that we think i should keep .
but the challenge is to try to figure out what it is and why we keep them , and whether it makes sense .
so let &apos;s get back to those two creatures that have been launched at the beginning of the talk .
we have two creatures , both the middle of 1979 at the same day .
so imagine that one of them , maria , was born for three months , so she was born in 1980 on june 1 in 1980 .
heinrich , on the other hand , is born to the chief daughter , so he was born on march 1 1980 .
only because of the fact that maria was born in three months , they get all kinds of three months ago -- to have the right to have the right sex , which is right to choose the right to drink .
heinrich has to wait for all this , not because he actually has another biological age , just because of his birth of time .
we &apos;re still finding other weird conditions about what their rights is .
heinrich , because you assume that he &apos;s male -- although i didn &apos;t say he &apos;s the associated with doodist -- because you think he &apos;s a male , he &apos;s now going to be able to do what maria has to worry about .
maria , not in all states , can &apos;t perceive the same right , the heinrich in all states , and that &apos;s the right to marry .
heinrich can marry a woman in every state , but maria can only marry a woman in a few states today .
so we have these permanent anatomical categories that are in many ways and fragments .
and for me , the question is : what are we going to do , because our science is doing this in the field of anatomy , that we have to achieve a point where we have to admit that a democracy , which could fall on anatomy , could fall apart ?
i don &apos;t want to give up science , but at the same time , it feels like the science is constantly self-assembling .
so where do we go ?
it seems like our culture would take a kind of pragmatic stance : &quot; well , we need to take a line somewhere , so we pull it somewhere . &quot;
but a lot of people start in a very strange position .
so for example , texas has decided to get to a point that one man means that you don &apos;t have y chromosome , and to marry a woman means that you have a y chromosome .
now in practice , people are not tested on their chromosomes .
but it &apos;s also very bizarre , because of the story i &apos;ve been telling you about the android receptor defect .
if we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us in his &quot; i have a dream . &quot;
he says we shouldn &apos;t do people after their skin , but after the quality of their character , &quot; judge them . &quot;
and i want to say , &quot; yes , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
but how do you do that in practice ?
how do you measure people based on their character properties ?
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we should distribute rights to people , because i have to admit that i know a series of golden conever , which probably is more socially more likely than some people i know .
i want to realize that i probably know some bright plasradordogs who are more thindious , more intelligent and more powerful to make their sexual relationships than some hundred years , which i know .
so how are we going to be asking the question of character &apos;s character ?
it turns out it &apos;s really difficult .
and part of me was wondering , what if the content of a personality would be something that would be in the future of machine readable ?
do we really want to go to that direction ?
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
what i know is that it really seems to be really important to think about the idea that the united states is acting to make thoughts about questions about democracy .
in our commitment to democracy , we &apos;ve done our right thing , and i think we would do our thing in the future .
we don &apos;t have the situation , like , in iran , the case of the case , where a man who pulled up sexually among other men is going to be death , it &apos;s because he &apos;s ready to take a dissection of education .
we don &apos;t exist .
i &apos;m glad to be able to say that we don &apos;t have these conditions -- a surgeon i talked about a few years ago that had a few siamese twins to separate them , to separate them , to make a name .
but when i was writing with him , and he asked why he made this effort -- it was high-risk surgeries -- his response , that in his country , would be very bad , and therefore he had to do it .
i told him , &quot; well , you &apos;ve moved political asyles instead of a surgery to separate them ? &quot;
the united states offer incredible opportunities to allow people to be the ones they are , without changing the state of the state .
so i think we need to be leaders .
well , just to conclude , i want to notice that i &apos;ve talked a lot about the fathers .
and i want to think about the possibilities of what democracy might look like , or looked at what if we had the mothers involved more .
and i want to say something which is a bit radical for a feminist , which is , i think there might be different kinds of insights that are written by different kinds of anatomy , especially when people think a group .
since years ago , because i was interested in intersexuality , i also interested in research in the part of gender .
and one of the things that i really found interesting is the difference between men and women in terms of how they think and behave in the world .
what we &apos;ve learned from cultural reengineering studies is that women , average -- not each , but on average -- tend to be more complex -- more often complex social relationships and the care for people who are vulnerable in the group .
and so , when we think about it , we have an interesting situation .
years ago , when i took a graduate student , one of my graduate students asked me who knew my interest in feminism -- i looked at myself as a feminist , so do it -- a really profound question .
he said , &quot; tell me what the feminine female female is . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s the most stupid question i &apos;ve ever heard .
in feminism , it &apos;s about sex to solve gender , so feminism isn &apos;t female .
but the more i thought about his question , so i thought it could be something female in feminism .
it &apos;s called , you know , there might be something in the average , which is what makes female brains different from what makes us attention to complex social relationships , and attention to the protective needs .
so where the founding fathers were highly challenged to find out how individuals could be protected before the state , it &apos;s possible that if we put more mothers in this concept , we &apos;re more likely to be a concept of how to protect , not just how to protect them , but how we can care for each other .
and maybe it &apos;s where we need to go into the future when we get democracy over anatomy -- less than thinking about the individual bodies what identity is about , and more thinking about relationships .
so , as people try to make a perfect connection , we think about what we can do for each other .
thank you .
i &apos;m jessi and this is my suitcase .
but before i show you what i &apos;ve got , i &apos;m going to make a very public confession , and that &apos;s : i &apos;m obsessed with outfits .
i love to find a different colorfroous , crazy outfit , to wear and photograph , and to photograph it recently and to bloggers .
but i buy nothing new .
i &apos;m going to get all my clothes from a second hand on watermarkets .
ooh , thank you .
boom shopping allows me to reduce the impact of my garderobe on the environment , and also put on my money exchange .
i meet all kinds of cool people ; my dollars for usually a good purpose ; i look pretty unique ; and it makes it shopping to my own personal .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
will it be my size ?
will i like color ?
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
if all the answers , i feel like i won .
i come back to my suitcase , and i &apos;ll tell you what i was doing here at ted .
i mean , what does anybody do with so many outfits ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought .
i brought seven separate pants pants , and that &apos;s all .
subpants for exactly a week are all i &apos;ve done in my suitcase .
i made sure that i was going to have everything else i would like to wear , if i was just going to palm springs .
and since she &apos;s not heard of me as the woman who runs here at ted in her underwear -- that &apos;s what i found a few things .
and i really want to show you my outfits for this week .
does that sound good ?
while i do that , i &apos;m also going to give you some of the lessons that i believe , whether you believe it or not learn from these ancient people .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
i call this the radiant tiger .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look great .
you can almost always look great for less than 50 dollars .
this whole outfit , including the jacket , i cost 55 , and it was the most expensive piece that i carried in this week .
monday : color is powerful .
it &apos;s almost an physiological impossible to be bad , if you &apos;re wearing light red pants .
if you &apos;re happy , you move other people .
tuesday : adaptation becomes completely degraded .
i spent a lot of time in my life trying to try and be myself , and simultaneously adapt me .
just be , who you are .
if you surrounded yourself with the right people , you won &apos;t just understand it , you &apos;ll appreciate it .
wednesday : embrace your inner child .
sometimes people tell me , i &apos;d be out of time as if i &apos;m wearing the games or that i remember her seven-year-old .
i &apos;d like to smile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
thursday : confidence is the key .
if you think you &apos;re in something good , it &apos;s almost safe .
and if you think you &apos;re not looking good in something , you probably have right .
i grew up with a mother who taught me the day for day .
but only when i was 30 , i really understood what that means .
and i &apos;ll just wrap it up for you .
if you believe that you &apos;re inside and outside a wonderful person , there &apos;s nothing you can &apos;t wear .
so there &apos;s no excuse for somebody here in this audience .
we should be able to eat everything we want .
thank you .
in friday : a universal truth -- five words : golden pailletes to everything .
and finally , saturday : one , a unique , unique style of personal style , is a great way to tell the world about something without having to say a word .
it was always proven to me and again again , when in this week people came to me , just because of what i was wearing , and i had great conversations .
obviously , it &apos;s not going to fit in my tiny suitcase .
so before i go home after brooklyn , i &apos;m going to donate it all again .
because the lesson i &apos;m trying to learn this week is that it &apos;s okay to leave .
i don &apos;t have to make these things unemotionally , because in the same way , it &apos;s going to always be a different kind of crazy , colorful , fuzzy outfit , just waiting for me , if i love a little bit in heart and search .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good afternoon , all together .
i have something i want to show you .
think of this as an imaging point when flying imaging .
this is what we call in our lab , perception design .
let me tell you a little bit about it .
now , if you take this picture -- i &apos;m originally italian , and everybody in italy grows with this picture in his room , but the reason why i &apos;m showing you this is a very interesting one in the past decades .
a few days ago , when they wanted to win a formula , they took their budget and put their money on a good driver and a good car .
and if the car and the driver was good enough , they won the race .
now , you need to have , if you want to win a race , actually something like this -- something that &apos;s held out of the car in real time , some thousands of sensors , the information of the car , and then they use that , and then they use things in real time , and then they use things in real time as information .
this would tell you , in engineering teams , a real-time control system .
and basically , it &apos;s a system that comes out of two parts -- a piece and an interpreting part .
what &apos;s interesting today is the real world &apos;s real-time control systems in our lives .
our cities have been equipped in the last few years , just with networks and electronics .
they become computer in the free .
and as a computer in the free , they start reacting to other kinds of ways , and they &apos;re being driven and driven .
if we put cities together , that &apos;s actually a big thing .
just by the way , i want to say that cities are only two percent of the earth &apos;s surface , but 50 percent of the world &apos;s population is living there .
they &apos;re 75 percent of the energy consumption -- it brings up to 80 percent of co2 emissions .
so if we do something about the cities , it &apos;s a big thing .
beyond the cities , all of that sense moves and driving in objects of everyday life .
this is from an exhibition , the paola antonelli for moma later in the year , working in the summer .
it &apos;s called &quot; pass with me . &quot;
well , all of our objects , our environment , start to speak back to us .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost like any atom out there to two , a sensor and a driver .
and that changes radically the interaction we have with our environment outside .
in a way , it &apos;s almost as if the old dream of michelangelo ...
you know , when michelangelo shaped the moses , it means he took the hammer , and he threw him on moses -- actually , you can still see a little bit of untary , and i said , &quot; well , perché non ? why aren &apos;t you proposing ? &quot;
well , today , our environment begins to respond to the very first time .
i &apos;m just going to show you a few examples -- again , with the idea of designing our environment and to make it happen .
let &apos;s start with the sense .
now the first project i want to show you is actually one of the first of our lab labs .
it emerged four and a half years ago in italy .
and what we &apos;ve done was actually to use a new kind of network that was used throughout the world -- that &apos;s a mobile phone web -- and anonymous and recycled information from this network to use how the city works .
summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
it was being won as italy in italy .
some of you will remember it was playing in italy against france , and then at the end , the headshock .
and anyway , italy won the end .
now you &apos;re looking at what happened this day only at the activity of activity that happens in the network .
here you see the city .
you can see in the middle of the giant sea .
on the morning , the game .
you see the timeline at the top .
early afternoon , people here and there , the phone calls and moving .
the game begins -- silence .
france makes a gate . italy does a gateway .
half-time , people make a short call , go to toilet .
second half-time . end of normal play time .
first extension , second extension .
zidane , in a moment of head .
italy wins . yeah .
well , in this night , everybody went to the center to celebrate .
they saw the great outbeat .
the next day , everybody went to the center to meet the germ team and the prime minister at the same time .
and then everybody went down .
you see the picture of the platco massimo , where , since the roman time , people go to celebrate -- to have a big party , and you see the bottom of the day .
now , this is just one example of how we can feel the city today , in a way that we couldn &apos;t do a few years ago .
again , another example of consciousness : this is not about people , but about things that we use and consume .
well , today we know everything about where our things are coming .
this is a map that shows you all the chips that have a mac computer , as they came together .
but we just know little about where things go .
so , in this project , we actually designed some small markers to track the waste during the system .
so we started with some volunteers that were helping us imagine something more than a year ago , in seattle , the things that they throw away -- different types of things as you can see -- things that you would throw away from .
then we have the little chips , the little brands , on the trash , and started tracking it .
here are the results we &apos;ve got right now .
from seattle ...
after a week .
with this information , we realized that there &apos;s a lot of inefficient things in the system .
we can do the same things in fact with less energy .
the data wasn &apos;t available before .
but this is a lot of unuseful transport and more complicated things .
but the other thing is that we believe that when we see every day , that the cup that we throw away doesn &apos;t just disappear , it &apos;s still sitting on the planet .
and the plastic bottle we still throw away every day .
and if we would show the people , then we can move into behavior change .
so this is the reason for this project .
my colleague at mit , assaf biderman , could tell you a lot more about the sense and the many other wonderful things that you can do with hearing , but i want to talk to you about the second part that we were discussing , and that &apos;s the stick of our environment .
and the first project is that we did a couple of years ago in zaragoza spain , spain .
it started with a question of civic school , which came to us and said that spain and south stimula have a beautiful tradition , in public places to use water as part of architecture .
and the question was : how could you connect technology to new technology ?
and one of the ideas that happened at mit in a workforce was , imagine these low-mammals , and valves , magnetic valve , valves , that open and close .
it &apos;s going to cause the kind of water distribution of water .
if these pictures fall down , they can write that they can write patterns , images , text ads .
and you can approach him , and it will open up to get you through , like you can see on this picture .
well , we presented the mayor .
it really loved him .
and we got the assignment to design a building in the expo .
we called it the digital water pavion .
the whole building was out of water .
there &apos;s no doors or windows , but if you approach it , it will open and leave you .
the roof was covered in water also .
and if it &apos;s windy , if you want to reduce the syringe , you can actually leave the roof .
or you could close the building , and the whole architecture is going to be like in this case , you know , this day when you go down the roof , you get images of people who were there and they say , &quot; they destroyed the building . &quot;
no , they didn &apos;t destroy the building ; it &apos;s just that architecture disappears almost away .
here &apos;s how the building works .
you see the person who &apos;s wondering what happens inside .
and here you see me when i tried to test the sensors that open water , not get wet .
now , i should tell you what happened at night when all the sensors stopped working .
but in fact , it was a even greater fun night .
all the kids from milagoza came to the building , because the way they played with the building was quite different .
no longer a building that would open up to leave you , but a building that has still paused and holes in the water , you had to jump now without getting wet .
and that was , for us , very exciting , because as architects , engineers , as designers , we always think about how people use things that we design .
but reality is always unpredictable .
and this is the beauty of creating things that are used and interact with people .
here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical imaging points , the points of water and the projections .
and this is what brought us to thinking about the following project that i &apos;m showing you now .
imagine that this imagery could really start to fly .
imagine you could have little helicopter that flies through the air , and every one of you with a little piece of reference with the light -- almost like a cloud that can move through the space .
here &apos;s the video .
imagine a helicopter , like the ones you saw before , who moves with other people , completely in synchrony .
you can have this cloud .
you can have a kind of flexible screen or an ad , like this -- a frozen formation of two dimensions .
or unregular , in three dimensions where what changes , the light is not the position of the imagery .
you can play with different ways .
imagine the screen could just appear in different formats or size , in different ways .
but then the whole thing could be a 3d cloud of paper that you can go to and move through that you can go through a lot of , many directions .
so here you can see a real flyfire-controlled control that goes down to form like a decent v .
if you turn the lights up , it looks like this . so the way we saw it before .
imagine that every single one of them is being operated .
it could have an impulse that could have a impulse that comes from people , from the motions of people or anything .
i want to show you something here first .
we worked with robert to bolle , one of the best ballet dancers of our time -- the étole on the metropolitan theater in new york , and the scala in maan -- we took his movement to the flyfire .
this is robert to dance .
on the left-hand side , you see the data points , the different senses .
it &apos;s a real-time 3d scan at the same time .
so you can feel the whole movement .
you can do that all the time .
but then , once we have all the imagery points , they can play with it and play with gravity with gravity .
we want to use that as a possible impulse for the flyfire .
i want to show you the latest project that we &apos;re working on .
it &apos;s something that we work on for the olympics in london .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
and the idea is , again , imagine that we &apos;re going to take the people to do something and change the environment -- almost as much as we call it , how we call it illumination motion , but with a cloud .
imagine that anybody can give a small donation for a point .
i think that &apos;s the remarkable of what &apos;s happening over the last few decades , that we &apos;ve changed from a physical to a digital world .
it has digitized everything , knowledge , and it makes it accessible by the internet .
now , for the first time , we can do it for the first time -- and the campaign has shown this -- we can tell from the digital world of self-dependence forces to the physical world .
that can be , in our case , that we use it to design and create a symbol .
this is something built in the city .
but tomorrow , to give us the next challenges -- think about climate change , or co2 emissions -- how can we move from the digital world to physical change ?
so the idea is that we actually engage people with them , in which they do things together .
the cloud is again a cloud of points in which the same kind of cloud is a cloud of particles .
and these particles are water as our cloud is a cloud of points .
it &apos;s a physical structure in london , but covered in the scene .
you can move inside and make different kinds of experiences .
you can actually look at it from the bottom , the most important moments for olympic 2012 and darbeyond , and use it as a kind of connection to community .
so both the physical cloud in the sky and something that you can go to , like londons , new mountain peaks .
you can go inside .
and a kind of digital biases in the night -- but most important , a new kind of experience for everyone who wants to go to the top .
thank you .
as an artist , it &apos;s really important to me .
through my work , i &apos;m trying to express that people are separate from nature and that everything is connected .
the first time i was in antarctica 10 years ago in antarctica , where i saw my first ice mountains .
i changed awe .
my heart rasten , i was didelig , while i tried to touch what was before me .
the ice mountains around me dropped 60 feet from the water , and i could only wonder that this was a snowflake on a different snow , year after year .
ice mountains are born as a calb of a glacier , and they break out of ice cream .
every ice mountain has its own individual personality .
they interact with their environment , and their experiences .
some soft people are willing to give up and sit down to the bitter end , whereas others don &apos;t get rid of it and put it into a kind of dramatic passion .
if you look at an ice mountain , you might think that they &apos;re isolated , separated and alone , as we often see people .
but the truth is far away .
as a iceberg , i melged his precursor atmosphere .
as the ice melts , he &apos;s picking up rich water drinking water , which is a lot of life forms .
i &apos;m going to go back to my photographs of this iceberg as if i was making portraits of my ancestors , where consciousness is that they look in these individual eye moments , and never get back to that .
it &apos;s not an death , if you melt ; it &apos;s not an end , but it &apos;s a continuous pole of your life cycle .
part of the ice in the ice mountains that i prioritize is very young -- some thousand years old .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
the last pictures that i &apos;d like to show you is an ice mountain , which i put in clubs in greenland .
very rarely , you &apos;re actually witnessing a rolling ice mountain .
here you see it .
on the left , you see a little boat .
that &apos;s about five feet long .
please watch the form of the iceberg and where it &apos;s in the water line .
you can see here , he begins to roll , and the boat has moved to the other side , the man is there .
this is the average size of a marine ice iceberg .
he takes about 120 feet from the water , or 40 feet .
and this video is in real time .
and just like that , show you a different side of his personality .
thank you .
my life is really quite blessed by the work of some amazing projects .
but the coolest thing i &apos;ve ever worked on was this guy .
his name is temple .
temple was one of the leading graffiti artists of the 1980s .
then one day , he came back from walking back and said , &quot; paps , my legs . &quot;
and that was the outbreak of the outbreak .
temple is fully paralyzed today .
he can only use his eyes yet .
i stood in front of him .
so i have a company that &apos;s doing design and animations , so graffiti , graffiti is a complex part of what we admire in the art world and pay attention .
so we decided , tony -- temple -- and his thing to support .
i met with his father and his brother and he said , &quot; we &apos;ll give you this money .
what are you going to do with it ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i want to talk to tony again .
i just want to talk to him , and i said , &quot; wait a minute , isn &apos;t that -- i saw stephen hawking -- can &apos;t communicate all the paralyzed people using these devices ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , only if you &apos;re in the higher life layer and has a remarkable insurance , you can really do that .
normal people are not available to these devices . &quot;
and i said , &quot; how does it communicate you ? &quot;
does anybody see the movie &quot; butterflow and spoil bell ? &quot;
that &apos;s how they communicate -- that &apos;s how their fingers walk along .
i &apos;m like , &quot; very archacally , how can that be ? &quot;
so i came up with the need to just take a check , and instead i put a check out of it , which i didn &apos;t know what to do .
i &apos;m going to prepare for the place , and for his brother , and his father -- with the words , &quot; good , my proposal is , tony will speak , we &apos;ll get a device and we &apos;ll find a way that he can make his art back .
because it &apos;s a farce that someone who &apos;s still wearing this is not able to communicate . &quot;
so i spoke a few months later at a conference .
i met these people from funl , graffiti research lab , and they have a technology that allows them to put a light on every surface and to draw with a laser pointer that &apos;s just the negative space .
so they pull around and make art installations like this .
they say all things that are shown up there will follow a life cycle .
it starts with the latals , and then they get the words , and then the bush &apos;s words , and the bush is actually doing art .
but there was always a life cycle in her presentation .
so i went home , and i had dinner with my wife and told her about everything , and we thought , &quot; well , second time , if there &apos;s this technology that you can use to drive things to drive things , we should be able to get a way to get a laser out of it , and then we should find a way that it could be implanted . &quot;
that was the beginning of the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , a lot of organization and a lot of things , we &apos;ve achieved some things .
first of all , we &apos;ve got the doors down the doors , and actually they get a device that he can communicate with -- an stephen hawkaster machine .
that was incredible .
and he &apos;s really extremely funny -- i call him yoda , because you talk to him , or get an email , and i think , &quot; i &apos;m so useless , this guy is incredible . &quot;
furthermore , we &apos;ve flown seven programmers around the world -- literally from all the corners of the world -- to us home .
my wife , and my children , and i moved into the garage , and these hackers and the programmers and the conspiracy , and we have taken over our house .
a lot of our friends thought we were beautiful to do that and that we would come back and all the images in the walls were graffiti .
but for over two weeks , we &apos;ve programmed , we went to the beach floor in venice , my children became involved , and we created this .
it &apos;s called eyewriter and you can see the description .
this is a cheap sunglasses that we bought on the beaches of venice , something copper wire and a few things from the building market and the electric trade .
we took an ec3-camera , and they made a distance , put them on a light light , and now we have a device that is freely available -- you can build it yourself , we can make the code free for free .
so we &apos;ve created a device that is completely free from constraints .
no insurance can be used .
no hospital .
now , every paralyzed one can actually communicate with his eyes , or draw .
thank you .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back in temple room .
i love this picture because it &apos;s the room of somebody else and that &apos;s his room .
now , there &apos;s all this rumble before the great unveiling .
and after a year of planning , two weeks of programming , nutherparties and bust , tony drew the first time back to seven years .
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and he looks beyond his life support system .
we owe his bed to be able to see it outside .
we &apos;ve got a projector set against a wall of the parking room before the hospital .
and he drew back to the first time in both his family and friends -- and you can only imagine what a feeling that was on the parking lot .
so , unfortunately , we also had to break into the parking lot , so we felt as a part of the spray .
at the end , he gave us an email with the contents of the content : &quot; for the first time , i &apos;ve done something .
i feel like i was squeezed under water , and finally someone pulled down and pulled up my head so i can breathe . &quot;
isn &apos;t that mind-blowing ?
this is something like our fight .
it keeps us with the pole , and we continue to evolve .
and we need to improve much more on this device .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s a magic panel .
and somebody who has such an artist deserve so much more .
so we &apos;re in finding out how to do it better , faster and stronger .
since then , we have all kinds of recognition .
we won some prizes .
remember , it &apos;s free , none of us deserve it .
it &apos;s all from our own pockets .
so the drawings were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
armstrong twitterled us and then , in december , the period magazine honored us as one of the 50 best inventions in 2010 , which was really great .
the coolest thing about it -- and that &apos;s the whole circle -- that it &apos;s this april , when it comes to los angeles in the inner city of los angeles a show called &quot; way of the streets . &quot;
and there will be so much the toughest of the art scene there -- banking , shesy , shepard friendship , caws -- all these guys will be there .
temple is being part of the show , which is pretty scary .
so basically , i think , if you see something that &apos;s impossible , it &apos;s possible .
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this microphone , the eyewriter -- everything was impossible at some point .
do it possible -- you all here .
i &apos;m not a programmer , and i &apos;ve never had anything to do with technology technology , but i &apos;ve just managed to do something and with amazing people surrounded with the legs .
and that question should be , every single one of you , in every single day , where you have a clue , which has to be done . if not now , when not , and when not , who ?
thank you .
so , i write for kids , and i &apos;m probably probably america &apos;s most likely child book author .
and i always say to people that i don &apos;t want to come like a scientist .
you can have me as a farmer , or in leather , but nobody ever voted a farmer .
today i want to tell you about circles and unagreements .
well , an epiphany is usually something you find because you &apos;ve dropped it somewhere .
you go around the block and it &apos;s a revelation .
this is a painting of a circle .
one of my friends did it -- richard bollywood .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle that i &apos;d like to share with you today .
my circle started in the &apos; 60s at the high school in stow , ohio , where i was the classroom gay .
i was the one who was beaten every week in the juvenile toilet green and blue , until a teacher saved my life .
she saved my life by using the toilet in the teacher .
that &apos;s what she did .
she did it for three years .
and i had to get out of town .
i had a thumb , i had 85 dollars , and it blew me up to san francisco -- i found a lover -- and then in the &apos; 80s , i thought i was taking a work on aids organizations .
about three or four years ago , i received a call in the middle of the night a call of this teacher , advising , who said , &quot; i have to see it .
i &apos;m sad that we &apos;ve never met each other as adults .
can you come to ohio , and please come together with the man i know that you &apos;ve found it .
and i should say to mention that i have the builders of mine , and that i want you to go ahead . &quot;
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
we looked at them , we laughed , we laughed , and we knew they should be in a hospice .
we found one for them , we brought them down , and we were taking care of them , and we gave them eight , because it was necessary .
it was something we knew .
and just as the woman who wanted to know me as adults who know me , she turned out to be a box of dance and turned into my hands .
what happened was that the circle was closed , it was a circle -- and the revelation i talked about .
the revelation is , death is part of life .
she saved my life , and my partner and i rescued her .
and you know , this part of life needs everything that takes the rest of life .
he takes truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so happy that this is so often mentioned here .
he needs it just -- he would need , love and pleasure , and it &apos;s about giving us those things .
thank you .
imagine a big explosion as they go up on 1,000 feet .
imagine a plane full of smoke .
imagine a driver &apos;s work , the blade , cuack , cuack , cuack , cuack , cuack , shack .
that sounds scary .
well , i had a unique space that day ; i sat on 1d .
i was the only one who could talk to the airport .
so i looked at it , and they said , &quot; no problem , we &apos;ve got some birds . &quot;
the pilot had already turned out , and we weren &apos;t so far away .
you could see manhattan .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
the pilot was running the machine after the hudson river .
it &apos;s usually not the route .
it turns out the engine works .
imagine a soundless plane .
and then he said three words -- the most emotions i &apos;ve ever heard .
he says , &quot; spend make up . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the nurses .
i could see it in their eyes , there was horror , the life was at the end .
i want to share with you three things that i &apos;ve learned on this day .
i learned that in a moment , it &apos;s all different .
we have this live plan , we have these things that we want to do in life , and i thought to all the people i wanted to do a hand , and it didn &apos;t really , all the fences i wanted to make , and i never did .
while i was thinking about it later , a saying that , &quot; i collect bad wa . &quot;
because if the wine is as far and the person is there , i open it up .
i never want to move more into life .
and this urgency , this goal , has really changed my life .
the second thing that i learned about this day -- and that was when we were touching the george washington bridge , so pretty much around hair -- i thought , you know , there &apos;s a thing i really regret .
i had a good life .
in my own humanity , and with my mistakes , i get to get better in everything i was drawn to .
but in my humanity , i gave myself my ego room .
and i took the time that i wasted for meaningful things , with people who do something .
and i thought about the relationship with my wife , to friends .
and after that , when i thought about it , i decided to put negative energy out of my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
i didn &apos;t take my wife for two years .
it feels great .
i &apos;m not trying to have anymore ; i &apos;m going to be happy to be happy .
the third thing i learned -- that &apos;s when the internal clock begins , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 , 13 ... &quot;
you see the water coming .
i said , &quot; please fly in the air . &quot;
i don &apos;t want this thing to break into 20 parts , like you know it from documries .
as we fall down , i had this feeling , human being is not terrifying .
almost as if we prepare our lives on it .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and this sadness was really in a thought , which is that i &apos;m just one thing .
i just wish i could grow up my children .
about a month after that , i went to see my daughter &apos;s performance -- prime grasts , not much artistic talent ...
... not yet .
and i cook , i just like a little kid .
and in the world , it made sense for me .
i realized , by the time , by connecting the dots to each other , it &apos;s just about being a great parent .
more than anything , everything else is in life , a good father .
i became the miracle part of that day not dying .
i got another gift , which is to see in the future , and come back and live differently .
my call to all of you who fly today is : imagine the same thing happening on your flight -- don &apos;t you -- but imagine you change ?
what would you do , which you &apos;re going to pick up because you think you &apos;d forever be there ?
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in it ?
and more than anything , are you the best parents you can only be ?
thank you .
the idea behind the xxnet computer worm is pretty straightforward .
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bomb .
the most important post there for the development of nuclear weapons is the uranium asset facility in nato .
the gray boxes that you see here are real-time control systems .
now , when it comes to us , the systems that are going to control and the valves control , then we can actually cause a lot of problems with the centrifuge .
these gray boxes don &apos;t walk with windmill software ; it &apos;s based on a completely different technology .
but if we can do that , that an effective windmill virus on a laptop is used by a laptop engineer , which is used by a waiting engineer , then we &apos;re in business .
and that &apos;s the planning behind xxnet .
so we start with a windmill dropper .
the data will be reformed in the gray box , damaged the centrifuge and the iranian nuclear energy program -- mission done .
this is a game game , right ?
i want to tell you how we found that .
when we started doing our research , six months ago , it was completely unknown , which was the purpose and purpose of this building .
the only thing we knew is very , very complicated , which is in terms of the air , the drone -- part , he made it from the mundane slio- .
and it seemed to have something to do with these gray boxes , this real-time -- control systems .
the animated of our attention , and we started a lab -- where we infected our environment with stuxnet , and we looked at this constructed .
and then something weird happened .
stuxnet complained like a laboratory rat who didn &apos;t like our cheese -- snick , but didn &apos;t want to eat it .
that made no sense in my eyes .
and after experimenting with different kinds of cheese , i went to realize that this is an informed attack .
fully focused on a particular goal .
the dropers act on the gray box , when a special configuration has been discovered . even if that &apos;s special , which is trying to infect it .
and if not , it does nothing .
so , that really was my interest , and we started working with it , almost about the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
it could be , for example , to say , an excellent plant plant , or a chemical plant in germany .
so we should better find out what the goal is .
so extrahied and decompited , we cut the attacks of the attacks and found out that he &apos;s put into two digital fisheads -- a smaller and bigger .
and we also noticed that they were very professional constructed by people who had obviously all the input information .
they knew any bits and bytes that they had to attack .
probably they even knew the shoe size of the machine interface .
so they knew everything .
and if you &apos;ve got the dropers of stuxnet complex and high-tech , let me tell you , the data is a science for itself .
it &apos;s much more sophisticated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
here you see a clip from this attack .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 lines code .
looks like old-fashioned bundbleres .
and i want to tell you how we were capable of being smart from this code .
so after what we were looking for first , systems function -- because we know what these things are .
and then we went to tiaching and data structures and tried to bring this with the real world into connection -- with potential goals in the real world .
so we needed theories about these goals that we could prove or dismediate .
so , in order to get these theories , we call ourselves in mind that it &apos;s definitely about high sabotage , it has to be a high-quality goal , and it &apos;s very likely to be in iran , because most infections were added .
now , in this area there &apos;s not multiple thousand targets .
it &apos;s basically what &apos;s going on on the buck nuclear power plant and the urance facility in nato .
so i said to my assistant , &quot; bring me a list of all the experts for centrizing and power plants from our client tribe . &quot;
and i called her up , and pump her knowledge to compare her knowledge to what we found in the code and in the data .
and that worked very well .
so , it was possible for us to bring the little digital fishead with the rotorcontroller .
the rotor is that moving part of the centrifuge , this black object you see .
and if you count the speed of this red mode , you actually have the ability to crack the rotor and finally get rid of the centrifuge .
what we &apos;ve found is that the goal of the attacks was actually , slowly , and to make it incredibly powerful -- in fact , trying to leave the engineers , so they won &apos;t be able to get out of it .
the great digital explohead -- we got a glimpse by looking at the data and data structures .
so for example , the number 164 is very out of this code ; you can &apos;t miss it .
i started working with scientific literature about how this centrist is built in nato , and found that they &apos;re structured in so-called caskaden , and every caskade contains 164 trillion trillion .
so that made sense to fit it together .
and it got better .
these centrical in iran are divided in 15 so-called products .
and guess what we found in the attack code ?
almost identical structure .
so again , it really adapted .
and this gave us great confidence for that we studied here .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , that wasn &apos;t easy .
these results have been achieved through several weeks hard work .
and we often run into a dead store and we had to collect .
anyway , we found that both digital exploheads in reality were actually on one and the same goal , but from different directions .
the small explohead takes over a caskade , and the rotors and slowed it down , and the big breed starts with six kascads in interaction and simulators .
so , in large and all , we &apos;re very confident that we actually determines what the goal is .
it &apos;s nato and it &apos;s just nato .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that other goals could be met by xxnet .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we &apos;ve discovered -- really made me look at the socks .
there &apos;s the gray box down there , and you see the centric .
now , what this thing is doing is that it &apos;s starting to start out of sensors -- so for example , of print sensors and vibral sensors -- and it turns out to be legitimate code that &apos;s in touch with the absence of false data .
and in fact , this false belief is taken out of stuxnet before .
so it &apos;s just like in hollywood movies , where there &apos;s a tracking tag in hollywood , and it &apos;s being fed up with a video record .
that &apos;s cool , isn &apos;t it ?
the idea of this is obviously not just the machine interface in the control room .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and more aggressive .
the idea is to overlist digital security system .
we need digital security systems where a human machine can &apos;t respond fast enough .
so in a power station , for example , if the big steam turbine becomes too fast , you have to open up the valves within milliseconds .
of course , this cannot be done by a human machine leader .
so we need digital security systems .
and when the prevalence is , then really bad things happen .
it can explode .
and neither the machine leaders , the security system will notice it .
that &apos;s scary .
but it &apos;s even worse .
and what i &apos;m saying now is very important .
think about it . this attack is generic .
he has nothing to do with centrizing , with urananans .
so , for example , he would work as well -- in a power station or a car factory .
it &apos;s generic .
and you don &apos;t have to -- as the attacder -- you don &apos;t have to use the data on an usbp stick , how we saw it in stuxnet .
you could also use ordinary worm technology to spread .
you just have to spread it as far as possible .
and if you do that , you end up getting a cyberweapon of mass destruction .
that &apos;s the consequence we have to do .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of goals is not in the middle east .
they &apos;re in the united states , in europe and japan .
so all these green areas , these are the main environments .
we need to have the consequences , and we &apos;re going to start preparing ourselves .
thank you .
i have a question .
ralph , it was reported very much that people assume that the mosthy is the main organization behind it .
is that your mind ?
okay , you really want to know that ?
yeah . okay .
i think the mossadan , but the driving force is not israel .
so the driving force behind it is cyberpower .
there &apos;s only one and these are the united states -- luckily , luckily .
because otherwise our problem would be even bigger .
thank you for having a fear of fear . thanks ralph .
i &apos;ve spent the last few years teaching myself in situations that normally are very difficult and kind of dangerous .
i went to jail -- hard .
i worked in a coal farm -- dangerous .
i filmed in war areas -- hard and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days doing nothing like this -- fun at the beginning , a little hard in the middle , very dangerous at the end .
in fact , i &apos;ve been exposed to the most horrifying part of my career to be terrible , and all of that for trying to study social biang so that they &apos;re compelling , and hopefully , in a way , what makes it possible for the audience and to make sense of what makes it possible .
so when i knew that i would come here to look at the world of branding and sponches , i knew i &apos;d make something slightly different .
some of you may have heard me off a few weeks ago at ebay .
i sent a few facebook messages , some twitter news , and i gave people the opportunity to stand the name of my tedtalk in 2011 .
in fact , some happy people and companies , wiser profits and nonprofits , the unique opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris anderson will never let it go back to the point -- the name of that is that it &apos;s not going to be a title .
so what you got was this : you name your name here : my tedtalk , which you don &apos;t know what the subject is going to be , and the one you could get to the content is to fly the ears , especially when i stand your company .
but even though , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
you know how many people look at these tedtalks ?
a whole lot .
this is just the subject of labor .
so despite this warning , i knew anybody would buy the name right .
if you had asked me this one year ago , i wouldn &apos;t have been able to tell you this .
but in the new project i work on , my new film , we study the world of marketing , advertising .
as i said , i went to some pretty terrible situations over the years , but nothing could prepare me , nothing i could do , anything so difficult and so dangerous to go with these guys in a room .
you know , i had the idea for a film .
what i want to do is a film about marketing , marketing and advertising , where the whole film is funded by product , marketing and advertising .
and the film is going to be called &quot; the equator . ever . &quot;
so what &apos;s happening in &quot; the abycket ever , &quot; is that everything from top to the end , from the beginning to the end , is completely covered with brands -- from the cover , which you see in the movie , that &apos;s the brand xist .
now this brand , gram stadium , the plain center ...
these people will be connected to the film in eedom -- forever .
and so the film is going to study this whole idea -- that &apos;s what ? ee, forever ?
i &apos;m an redundant person .
it was more concrete .
it was &quot; in ee, forever . &quot;
but we &apos;re not just going to have the brand step as a tour , but we &apos;ll be sure we &apos;ll sell every possible category in the movie .
so we might sell a shoe and it &apos;s going to be the greatest shoe that they ever wore ...
the greatest car you &apos;re ever pulled out of &quot; the sumidac ever , &quot; which you have ever had , you know , is a attention of &quot; the hurdy-gurdy ever . &quot;
so the idea is , is it to show that brands are part of life , actually , to bring it to the film ?
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
the goal of all video is transparency .
you &apos;ll see the whole thing in the movie of abundance .
so this is the whole concept , the whole film , from beginning to end .
and i would enjoy if ceg would help to do this .
you know , it &apos;s funny , because when i first heard it , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience .
but i don &apos;t know how to be biased people .
do you have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use &quot; perspective , &quot; because that has a negative connotation -- but you know how to develop ?
how much money is needed to realize that ?
1.5 million .
i think it &apos;s hard to meet , but i think it &apos;s worth any way , some really familiar brands .
who knows when the film comes out , we may see like a volame vollidite .
what do you think the answer will be ?
the answer will be highly , &quot; no . &quot;
but is it a difficult thing about the film or a difficult thing for me ?
jk : both .
so ... so , not so optimistic .
so , my lord , can you help me ? i need help .
i can help .
okay .
fantastic .
we need to think about what brands .
yeah .
if you look at the people they have to do it ...
there are some places that we can turn to .
put the camera out .
i thought , &quot; imagine the camera , &quot; that we wanted to do a background interview .
it turns out it was actually meant , &quot; we want nothing to do with your movie . &quot;
and just as disappeared all these companies , one after the other .
no one wanted to do something about the movie .
i was amazed .
they wanted nothing to do with the project .
and i was confused , because i thought the whole concept , the idea of advertising , is to present your product as many people as possible , it &apos;s so many people as possible .
especially in today &apos;s world , at this interface of new and old media , and the media media -- it &apos;s not the idea of being in this new kind of exciting endeavor instrument that the mass is going to bring .
no , that was what i thought .
but look , the problem was that my idea had a fatal mistake , and that was the following .
actually no , that wasn &apos;t the mistake at all .
that would have not been a problem at all .
that would have been okay .
but what this picture is , is a problem .
look , if you &apos;re seeking transparency at google , that &apos;s one of the first images that appear .
i really like your way , sergey brin . now .
this was the problem : transparency -- free from deception and backline , just to explore and look through ; characterization is characterized by perceptions and access to information , especially what business deals are .
you know , we &apos;re listening to a whole lot of about transparency .
our politicians say it says , our president says it , even our ceos say it .
but if it comes to it , it &apos;s going to change something .
but why ? well , transparency is scary -- like this strange bear , which still pushes .
it &apos;s unpredictable -- like this strange land road .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
what else is even risky ?
a whole dish very cool .
this is very risky .
so when i started talking to the companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want to tell a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
you see , when i was a kid , and my father was standing in lying -- and he &apos;s sitting there watching me look at this -- he would say , &quot; my son , there &apos;s three versions .
there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the real version . &quot;
so you can see , with this film , we wanted to tell the real version .
but there &apos;s only one company , a agency ready to help us -- and that only , because i have john bond and richard kirshentree &apos;s tree since years -- i realized i needed to do it in the middle , and i had to get to the companies right now with my team .
so what you suddenly started to understand -- or what i started to understand -- was that when you start talking to these companies , the idea of how your brand is understood is a bigger problem .
i &apos;ve got friends who make large , giant hollywood movies , and i have friends that are doing little mini-compounds like me .
and my friends , the big , giant hollywood movies , say that the reason why their films are so successful is the brand partners that they have .
and then my friends , who are making little hype films , &quot; how do we compete with these big gigantic hollywood movies ? &quot;
and the movie is called &quot; the leviathan . ever . &quot;
so how exactly are we going to see a ban in the movie ?
whenever i go to the way , and whenever i open the medical record , you &apos;ll see a ban .
and every time i do an interview , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ?
they &apos;re so far ? you see a little nervous .
i want to help you calm down .
so maybe you should put a little on this interview . &quot;
and then we offer one of these great shit .
either flats of fusion or a paradise winds , they will have the choice .
we &apos;re being equipped for both men and for women -- hang on , rolling , or a stick , whatever .
that &apos;s the short version .
now , i can answer all of your questions and give you an exit version .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
as you talked about the smaller movies , we &apos;re a challenging .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other brands .
so doing things like this -- you know , people remember fighting -- that &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested .
what would you describe a ban ?
ban is freeman .
this is a great question .
woman &apos;s technology .
technology is not the way that you should describe something that someone &apos;s going to do .
we &apos;re talking about bold , fresh .
i think , &quot; fresh is a great word that these categories really do something positive , unlike &quot; fighting odor and humidity . &quot;
it keeps you fresh .
how can we keep them fresh -- better fresh , fresh , fresh , fresh .
these things have a more positive effect .
and this is a million-year-old company .
what about me ? what about the prints ?
i have to talk to the man on the street , who are like me to normal consumers .
you should tell me something about my brand .
how would you describe your brand ?
hmmm , my brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i really like happy clothes .
&apos; 80s revival hits skate , except the sink .
all right , what &apos;s the brand scry ?
unique .
i think the genre , the style i have , is probably &quot; dark glamour . &quot;
i like many black colors , many gray sounds and so forth .
but i normally have a command , like sunglasses , or a jewelry , and so stuff .
if dan would be a brand , he would probably be a classic director of the cabrio .
you know , the brand i &apos;m , i would say , is comsuring fly .
two : part of kobe , part of yogi , partly brooklyn girl -- i don &apos;t know .
man 3 : i &apos;m the smuseum guy .
i sell the whole country around the country .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
this is my brand in my little , distorted industry .
man 4 : my brand is fedex , because i was biased .
man 5 : brand feated alcoholic writer .
is that ?
lawyer : i &apos;m an anwaltsmark .
i &apos;m tom .
well , we can &apos;t be all the toms brand , but i often look at the interface of darkglamour and cooling fly .
and what &apos;s noticed was that i needed a experts .
i needed someone who could get into my head , someone who could really help me understand what &apos;s called &quot; branded personality . &quot;
and so i found a company called olson zsten , in pittsburgh burg .
they &apos;ve helped companies like netivity , festaze , hallmark , to discover these brand personality .
if you could do it for me , you could also help me .
they brought their pictures , yes ?
that &apos;s what i did . the first picture is a picture of my family .
just tell me a little bit about how it &apos;s related to your thoughts and feelings about yourself .
these are the people who form my global view .
tell me about this world .
md : this world ? i think the world is the world where you live -- how people around you , the friends , the family , the family , the way you live life , the way you live .
all these things come and start from a place , and for me , and i start with my family in west virginia .
what &apos;s next is what you want to talk about .
the next one . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
what kind of context is that thinking and feelings about them ?
it &apos;s like i want to be .
i like things that are different .
i like things that are queerer . i like strange things .
tell me about the &quot; why &quot; period -- what does it bring us ?
what is the machete ? what dolls are you right now ?
why is it important to start ? what represents the red ?
tell me a little bit about this part .
a little more about you , you &apos;re not .
what other metals have they gone through ?
you don &apos;t have to be afraid . what kind of achteraster are you ?
eeeeee ! no , thank you .
thank you very much for patience .
yeah . well . all right .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on .
there was a lot of crazy things going on there .
the first thing that i saw was this idea that their brand caps have two separate , but turned out the pages -- the morgan traop &apos;s brand is an eight-degree mark .
it &apos;s very good .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction .
and i think some companies are only going to focus on a strength , rather than both .
a lot of companies tend to -- and this is the human nature -- to avoid things that they &apos;re not sure they &apos;re going to avoid , they &apos;re afraid , these elements , and they &apos;re actually going to take it to something positive , and that &apos;s a kind of a kind of cool chess move .
what other brands do you do ?
the first one is a classic , apple .
and you can see here , target , wii , mini of mini coopers and jet blue .
well , there was brands and mind-speed brands , these things that come and go , but one of them , eight fake brand is a pretty strong thing .
and one eight-table , in fact , plays brand . how is your brand ?
if somebody asked them to describe their brand identity , their brand personality , how would they be ?
you put it up there ? are you something that takes your blood ?
or are they more like a down delay ?
are they something that a little quiet , more conservative , conservative ?
up there are things that are wired to play , fresh as the distant prince , according to adventurous , adventurly , and ensuring , teenage , glorious , fuzzy , mystical and mystical and mystical .
or are they more like a down delay ?
are you eight degrees and moons like usual 7 ?
are they established , traditionally , foster , intellectual as oprah ?
are they reliable , stable , familary , safe , born , caring , caring , like the dalai lama or yoda ?
over the past , we had more than 500 companies , up and down and down companies , and they said no , because they didn &apos;t want to be part of the project .
they had nothing to do with this movie , because they didn &apos;t have control , no control over the finished product .
but 17 brand partners , who were willing to be willing to get to those control that were going to be doing business with someone who &apos;s going to be doing business with someone like me , and the end of us to tell stories that we would usually not have had -- stories that would never support a value .
they made us to tell the story of the neuromarketing , as we tell the story in this movie that you &apos;re using mris to be able to do the dough centers of the brain , both in order to do surgery and films .
we went to sao paulo where foreign advertising has been banned .
in the entire city , for five years , they don &apos;t have a guarantee , no poster , no butterfly , nothing .
and we went to school districts where companies were in their way into the schools , in america .
the incredible for me is that the projects i got most of the feedback , or where i had the greatest success , those are where i was interacting with things directly .
and that &apos;s what these brands have done .
because they went to the middle man , they went to the authorities , and they said that the agencies maybe don &apos;t really have their interest in the sense .
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artist directly .
i &apos;m going to work with him and create something completely different , something that people will think that the world &apos;s thinking is challenging .
and what was that for you ? what &apos;s successful ?
now , since the film of sundance film festival , we can look at this .
according to burrcal , the last january , and since -- and that &apos;s not even the whole thing -- there were 900 million volumes of this film .
this is actually just a period of two 1 weeks .
this is just online -- no press , no television .
the film has not been balanced .
there isn &apos;t even online . no offending .
it &apos;s not in other countries yet .
well , finally , the film has a very large momentum .
and that &apos;s not bad for a project where almost any commercial agency , which we were talking about , recommending their clients , the fingers of it .
something that i firmly believe is that when you reach your chance , you &apos;re taking risks in these risks .
i think if you hold people out of it , you get them to fail .
i think that if you raise your employees , you &apos;re taking risk , you &apos;re prepared to get a profit .
i feel that we need to encourage people to take risks .
we need to encourage people not to be afraid of opportunities that you might be afraid of .
finally , we should be welcome to fear .
we should put the bear in the cage .
please welcome the fear . welcome the risk .
one of the big dives of it is we welcome the risk .
and finally , we should be welcome to transparency .
today , more than ever before , a little bit of honesty brings us very far .
and that said , with honesty and transparency , my whole talk , &quot; you welcome transparency to them , &quot; they were told by my good friends of emc who were paying for the name of ebay .
big data is transformed for organizations around the world in large opportunities .
emc : &quot; you welcome transparency &quot;
thank you very much .
now , morgan , in the name of transparency , what is happening now with the $ 7100 ?
this is a great question .
i &apos;ve got a check in my pocket , up to the top organization of the ted organization , the saplan foundation -- a check at $ 7100 , to fund my ted performance next year .
my name is amit .
18 months ago , i was doing something else in google , and i started making something with museums and art , and my editors , who &apos;s also now , gave me green light .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of fun negotiations and stories , i can tell you , with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the demo .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we did this .
i think my personal view is very simple with this slide and its access .
i grew up in india .
i became a great training part -- i wouldn &apos;t cut myself -- but i had no access to many museums and this artwork .
when i went to visit and visit these museums , i started to learn a lot .
and while i was working for google , i tried to do this complaint -- to make art accessible -- with technology together .
we then set up a team , a great team , and we started .
i &apos;m probably going to start with the demonstration and tell you some interesting things that happened since the beginning .
so you &apos;re just going to be a donation projection .
you can see in all these museums here .
there &apos;s the uffizi , moma , the hermitage , the rijks , the van gogh .
i even come in one of my favorite , the redwood museum of art in new york .
you come in for two -- very simple .
click , and it &apos;s in this museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where they are -- bombay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t matter .
you go around and around .
you want to engage in the museum ?
open the map , and jump with a click .
they &apos;re in there , they want to end up to the end of the gang .
just further . lots of fun .
follow them .
thank you , but the best thing is still coming .
so i am now in front of one of my favorite images , by beugel breugel in the met .
i see this plusmark .
if the museum gave us the picture , they click on it .
now this is one of the images .
these are all metadata .
those of you who are really interested in art can click here -- but i &apos;m going to click now .
this is one of the images we &apos;ve signed with the so-called gigapixel technology .
for example , this picture has about 10 billion imaging points , i think .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you get for 10 billion ? &quot;
that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to show you .
you can zoom in very easily and zoom out .
you see something fun here .
i love this guy ; his expression is unaffordable .
but then you really want deep inside .
and so i started playing around , and i realized that there &apos;s something going on there .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
i went close , and i slowly realized that these kids actually hit something .
i was going to talk a little bit about a couple of known people with met , and actually found that it &apos;s a game called quail , where a hurricane is being filmed at a time .
it seemed quite popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
in order to go close , you can go to the lowest .
just to give you the reference , i zoom out , so you can see what you get .
here we were , and this is the painting .
the best thing is , in a second .
let &apos;s go fast to moma , again in new york .
another favorite picture of me , starnight night .
in the previous example , it was about finding details .
but what if you want to see the pinking ?
and what if you want to see how van gogh has created this master &apos;s work ?
you zoom in . you can really go in .
i &apos;m going to zoom in into one of my favorite quarters of this picture , until i really am overwhelmed .
this is star night , probably never before .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
there are many more , but i &apos;m missing the time .
this is really cool part , it &apos;s called collections .
each of them , every one -- if rich or arm , whether they have a great house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
you can go ahead and create your own museum online -- from all these images you can put on your own collection .
very simply , you go inside -- and i &apos;ve created this , it &apos;s called the leviathan of the theremin -- you can zoom around .
this is what the national election is in .
you can put it all with note , send your friends , and so you start talking about what you feel when you look at these masterpieces .
i think finally , for me , the main thing is that all the wonderful things are not coming from google .
i think they &apos;re not even coming from the museums .
i should not say that .
they come from artists .
and that was an experience in humility for me .
i mean , i hope that we &apos;re going to be able to do this digital medium of art , and they represent it just online .
and the biggest question that &apos;s recently asked me is , &quot; did you do that to replicate the experience of a museum ? &quot;
the answer to this is no .
it &apos;s supposed to add the experience .
that &apos;s why . thank you .
thank you .
this is a representation of your brain . your brain can be divided into two halves .
this is the left half , which is the logical side , and then half the rights that the intuitive side is .
if we had a scale to measure the aplets , we could visualize their brain .
for example , that would be someone who &apos;s completely logical .
this would be someone who &apos;s completely intuitive .
now , where would you scale your brain on this scale ?
some of us may have chosen for one of these extreme , but i think , for most people in the audience , their brain looks like this -- with a high apthouse that are at the same time in both hemispheres .
it &apos;s not like they &apos;re both exclusive or anything .
you can be logical and intuitive .
and so i see as one of the people , in common with most other experimental quantum physics , who need a good percentage logic to bring together the complex ideas .
but at the same time , we need a good percentage of intuition to actually perform the experiments .
how do we develop these intuition ? well , we love playing things .
so we go out and play with it and look like it &apos;s reacting , and then we start developing our intuition .
basically , they do the same thing .
so one of the intuitive dimensions you &apos;ve developed over the years is probably that a thing can be at the same time at the same time .
i mean , it can sound strange about thinking about a thing at the same time in two different places , but they were not born with this idea , they developed them .
i remember seeing a kid playing on a floor threshold .
he was still a little kid and not very good at it .
but i bet that it was playing with the soil threshold a very valuable lesson , which is the big things not just leave you , and that you stay on a place .
and this is a great conceptual model of the world , so long they don &apos;t have any particle physicists .
it would be a horrible model for particle physicists , because they don &apos;t play the soil , but with these little strange particles .
and if you &apos;re playing with your particles , all kinds of weird things -- like you &apos;re flying directly through walls , or you can be at the same time at two different places .
and so they wrote all these observations , and they called the theory of quantum mechanics .
this was the state of physics a few years ago ; you needed quantum mechanics to describe the little tiny particles .
but you didn &apos;t need them to describe the great everyday objects around us .
it didn &apos;t enjoy my intuition and maybe just because i don &apos;t often play with particles .
well , i play sometimes with you , but not very often .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
i mean , nobody ever saw a particle .
but my logical side doesn &apos;t really like it .
because if all of these things are made out of particles , and all these particles follow the rules of quantum mechanics , then shouldn &apos;t it just follow the rules of quantum mechanics ?
i don &apos;t see why it shouldn &apos;t be that way .
so i would feel more clear about the whole thing , if we could show that everyday objects follow the rules of quantum mechanics .
so i did a couple of years ago doing this .
i created one .
this is the first object you can see in the quantum mechanical superposition .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and you can see this green dot there in the middle .
that &apos;s the piece of metal i &apos;m going to talk about .
this is a picture of the object .
this is what i &apos;m doing . we &apos;re looking at the center here .
and here &apos;s a really big close-up of this little piece of metal .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little bit of metal that &apos;s shaped like a spring , and it &apos;s over the edge .
so i made this thing in a way that you do a computer chip .
i went to a clean space with new silicon slices , and rackled for 100 hours of all the great devices .
for the last bit , i had to build my own machine -- to get this kind of swimming pool formed hole and the thing .
this thing has the ability to be in quantum mechanical superposition , but it takes a little help to do it .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you know how uncomfortable it is to be in a crowded elevator ?
i mean , if i &apos;m alone in the elevator , i do all kinds of weird things , but then other people go up and i &apos;ll listen to all these things because i don &apos;t want to touch it with it , because i didn &apos;t want to touch it .
quantum mechanics says that unmoving objects are just the same .
they &apos;re not just people who are not just people who are not only people , but also the light that appears to them and the wind of the space .
and so we knew that if we wanted to see that this piece of metal , that piece of metal , we had to throw out the whole thing .
and that &apos;s what we did .
we shut down the lights , put it into a vacuum and all the air , and i got it close to almost the end of the elevator alone , and the piece of metal was free to behave like it did .
so we measured his movement .
we found that it &apos;s moving really strange .
rather than that , it &apos;s just going to stand there , vibrating it , and the way it hits it was kind of like this -- how a expanding and more flexible bladder ebalg .
in that we gave him a little push , we could put it on the same time , and not vibrate -- something that allows you to be in quantum mechanics .
so what i &apos;m telling you is what &apos;s really awesome .
what does it mean for an object to vibrating at the same time and not vibrating ?
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
so the first case : all the trillions of atoms that are coming from the piece of metal are still there , and the same atoms are moving up and down .
only to more precise points are true .
the rest of the time they are delicious .
that means that every atom is at the same time at two different places , which is the whole piece of metal in two different places .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
really .
it was worth it for all this year in the clean space , because , you know , the scale of scale between one atom and this piece is about the same as the difference between the piece of metal and you .
so if a single atom can be at the same time at two different places , that piece of metal can be in two different places , why not you ?
i mean , this is just what my logical side is .
so , imagine you were at the same time at various places , how would that feel ?
how would your consciousness handle that your body is delocalized in the room ?
there &apos;s another aspect of the story .
when we open it up , the light formed and looked inside the box , we saw that the piece of metal was always in a piece .
and so i had to develop this new intuition that it looks like all the objects in the elevator are really just open objects in a small room .
you hear a lot about how quantum mechanics says everything is connected to everything .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
there &apos;s more than that , it &apos;s even deeper .
it &apos;s that these connections , their connections with all the things around them , literally define who they are , and that &apos;s the profound and strange of quantum mechanics .
thank you .
in 2007 , i decided that we should be able to reinnovate how we think about economic development .
it should be our goal that if families are thinking about where they live and they want to work , they give them the opportunity to choose between at least one hand full of different cities that are all in competition .
now we &apos;re far away from this goal .
there are billions of people in developing countries that don &apos;t even have a single city to be welcome to .
but the amazing thing about cities is they &apos;re much more valuable than building it .
so we could get the world very simple with duzend , maybe hundreds of new cities .
now this may sound absurd for you , if you &apos;ve never thought about new cities .
they &apos;re simply trading into building homes against the cities .
imagine half of the people who want to live in homes , they already did ; the other half don &apos;t yet .
you could try to expand the capacity of existing existing apartments .
but you know what they were going to do , in these homes , and their environment , they have laws to avoid misbreaks and dismediate from the creation .
so it turns out to be very hard to get rid of all these transcensions .
but you could go to a completely new place , build a whole new block of home , put the laws in there , and not prevent it .
so i suggested that governments create new areas that provide enough space for a city and gave them a name : charter cities .
later , i figured out that about the same time , ja4 and octavio was thinking about the challenge of a reform in hong duran .
they knew that every year about 75,000 hondurans were leaving their country to go to the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to make sure that these people can stay in their country and do exactly the same thing in hong duras .
in this place , ja4 to octavio said , &quot; what happens when we put it on the land of our country , what if we just put it on a message -- a part of the american embassy , a part of the canadian botture and the united states , if you want to work on the canadian rules or the united states , if you want to work on the canadian rules or the united states , you can go and work on the surface of these messages . &quot;
in the summer of 2009 , honduras suffered under a high-dose of plastic .
in the next planint election , pepe lobo won peop lobo , whose program , both innovations , and smash .
he asked octavio to become his stable check .
in the meantime , i was doing a talk at tedglobal .
through improvement , and through the study of consumers , i tried to reduce this complicated concept of the charter city to basically reduce elements .
the first point is the importance of laws , laws that determine that you don &apos;t have to bother existing owners .
we &apos;re paying new technology to new kinds of technologies , but for progress , it &apos;s technologies and laws , and it &apos;s usually laws , and it &apos;s usually laws that keep us back .
in the fall of 2010 , a friend from guatemala jatavio sent the link to the tedtalk .
and again , he showed him ja4 .
the two they call me .
and said , &quot; let &apos;s present the head of our country . &quot;
so we met in december in december of a hotels in miami .
i &apos;ve tried to make sure how valuable cities are , how much valuable they are than they cost .
and i used this chart to show how valuable and is in a place like new york . think of a surface of dollars per square meter worth of dollars .
but it was a pretty abstract discussion , at one point when there was a pause , octavio said , &quot; paul , maybe we could look at the tedtalk . &quot;
so the tedtalk took place in very simple form that a charter city is a place where the beginning is uninhabited land , a greening contract that supports the laws that are there and the ability to choose to live under those rules or not .
that &apos;s why i was asked by the president of hong duras , who was that we have to make this project important , that it &apos;s important , and that this is the way our country is going to move .
i was asked to come to tegucigalpa , and i was going to give a talk on the fourth and fifth of january .
so i &apos;ve been given one extra talk with facts that have a chart like this , which is trying to show that if you want to create a lot of value in a city , it must be a very large city .
this is a picture of the city , and the sketch represents the new airport that was built in denver .
this particular airport has a 100 square miles .
so i &apos;ve tried to convince the hondurans if you want to build a new city , you start with a field of at least 1,000 square kilometers .
this is more than 250 thousand tomorrow .
polite all the applaudio .
the faces of the audience were very serious and careful .
the director of the congo came up on the stage and said , &quot; professor romer , thank you very much for your talk , but maybe we might look at the tedtalk .
i have him on my laptop here . &quot;
so i sat down , and they put the tedtalk .
and i &apos;ve come to the core point that a new city offers new possibilities .
there would be the opportunity to live in a city that would be in hong duran , rather than hundreds of miles away .
and a new city includes new opportunities for leaders with leaders .
the leaders of the government in hong durra were on the help of capital countries , they could benefit from their partner countries that they would apply to the law for this charter and to support that the charter is really going to be fooled .
and the realization of president lobo , was that the compassion that i was thinking about as a way to get the foreign investors to come and build this city , could be more significant for all parties in hong durduras for many years .
we went into a field .
this is a place from this place .
it sums up a thousand square kilometers .
and shortly after that , at the 19th of january , you &apos;ve voted on congress for a change of the constitution to have a negotiation , which is responsible for special development areas .
in a country that has just been a very strong crisis behind itself , congress has been elected to a voice with 324 a voice .
all parties , all the foundations of society , supported this .
in order to be part of the constitution , it has to be asked twice by congress .
in february 17th , it became a second time with 14 to a voice approved .
immediately after that election , between the 21st and the 24th of february , a delegation of about 30 floors went to the two places in the world that were most interested in the place of the urban building .
one place is south korea .
this is a picture of a large new city in southern korea built in southern korea -- great than the city .
everything you can see on this picture was built within four years after it took four years to get permission .
the other place that was very interested in building is singapore .
it &apos;s been built two cities in china , and the third is in preparation .
so if you &apos;re basically thinking about it , it &apos;s where we are today .
they already have a building site ; they already discuss this area for the second city .
it &apos;s already been working on a legal system that users will be able to participate , and it &apos;s also working on an external legal system .
a country has already offered its supreme court to provide the same court as the court of the public court system .
also , urban designers and farmer are very interested .
they even get funding with it .
one thing , as you already know , has been a lot of mists .
there are many companies who like to be in america especially in a place with a free trade zone , and there are lots of people who would love to live there .
there are 700 million people around the world who are willing to say that they want to live in a radically different place .
a million people return latin america and walking into the united states .
many of them are fathers who are forced to let their families go back to work , and sometimes they &apos;re single mothers who have to make enough mothers who need to earn enough money and clothing .
unfortunately , sometimes it &apos;s kids who are trying to find their parents , which they have , in some cases , haven &apos;t seen anymore .
so what is it for an idea to think about it in hong duran a completely new city ?
or even duzend of these cities , or hundreds of people around the world ?
so what is it for an idea to insist that every family has a choice between multiple cities that are in competition ?
this is an idea worth spreading .
my friends from hong duras were asked to say , thank you ted .
you know how many choices they make in a typical day ?
you know how many choices they make in a typical week ?
i &apos;ve done a poll recently with over 2,000 americans , and the average number of choices that make a typical american in a day is 70 .
recently , recently , a study was done with ceos in which they saw the ceo for a week .
and these scientists have just documented the different themes with which these ceo , and how much time they spent to make decisions that relate to the issues .
and they found that an average ceo was busy in the week with 139 tasks .
and of course , each of these themes was made of many , many smaller decisions .
50 percent of their decisions were made within nine minutes or less .
just for about 12 percent of their decisions , they needed an hour or more of their time .
think of your own choices .
do you know how many decisions they make in the category of nine minutes in the category ?
how good do you think they are to overcome decisions ?
today , i &apos;d like to talk about one of the biggest decision-making problems of our modern time , which is decision-making problem .
i want to talk about the problem and talk about some possible solutions .
now , if i talk about this problem , i &apos;ll ask you some questions and i want to know your answers .
if i ask you a question , please raise , because i &apos;m blind , only if you want to burn some calories .
otherwise , if i ask you , if i ask you a question , and your answer is , well , my first question is , are you ready to hear about the decision-making problem ?
thank you .
when i was a graduate student at stanford university , i went to this very exclusive lifestyle store , at least it was really exclusive .
it was a shop that was called the draeger .
this business , it was almost like a pleasure process .
they had 250 different kinds of mustard and trucks and over 500 different kinds of fruits and vegetables and more than two dozen different types of water -- and that was at a time when we were actually drinking water .
i loved it to go to this business , but at a time , i asked myself , well , how is it that you never buy anything ?
here &apos;s the olive oil gang .
they had about 75 different varieties of olive oil , including those who were in boxes of a thousand years old trees .
so one day , i decided to visit the challeiter , and i asked the ladder , &quot; does this model work that you really offer the people ? &quot;
and he showed up to the bus charges of tourists that came and had their cameras in it .
we decided to do an experiment and we chose to experiment for our experiment .
here &apos;s her gang gang .
they had 348 different types of marmelade .
we &apos;ve put a little dick right on the track of the team .
we put in six different bands of flavor there , or 24 different bands of flavor , and we &apos;ve looked at two things : first of all , i want to be more people , and what would we try to do ?
there are more people left when there were 24 , about 60 percent when it was six , about 40 percent .
and then we looked at what the human beings were doing more like a glass of marmelade .
now we saw the reverse effect .
from the people who stayed as it were 24 , only three percent would actually buy a glass of mars .
from the people who were hungry than six , now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a glass of mars .
well , if you calculate it , people bought six times a glass of mars , who they had six to the choices when they had 24 .
now , to decide not to buy a glass of marmelade is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our taille -- but it turns out that the decision of influence is also affecting us in very conoccupied decisions .
we don &apos;t choose to decide , even though it goes to our own best interests .
so the theme of the day is finance .
i &apos;m going to describe to you now a study that i &apos;m using with gur huberman , ei kanang , which is where we did the decisions of savings for retirement for almost a million americans in the entire united states .
and what we looked at was whether the number of whistles were possible to be able to get a retirement plan plan to be a 401 plan , the chance of being more likely to be saved by tomorrow .
and we found that there was actually a context .
so in these plans , we had about 657 plans that gave people something between two to 59 different fund .
and what we found was that the more fund being offered , that , in fact , was lower .
now if you look at the extreme , the plans , the two fund , they had a part-up in the seventh &apos; 70s -- still not as high as we want .
in the plans that offered nearly 60 fund , the bottom of them dropped to about the sixth percentage .
now , it turns out that even if you were to participate in yourself , if you have more options , you have negative consequences .
so , the people who decided to participate in that , more and more , that the more possibilities they have available to them , the more avoided they are , and to choose funds .
the more possibilities they have available to them , the more they put their money in plain markets .
none of these extremes decisions , it belongs to decisions that someone would recommend if it &apos;s important to our future finance .
now , in the last 10 years , we &apos;ve observed three essential negative consequences that offer the offer of more and more choices .
they push the decision -- push , even when it comes to their own best interest .
they &apos;re more likely to make more choices -- worse financial and worse medical decisions .
they &apos;re more interested in things that they make themselves less comfortable , even if they make objective better .
the main part of this is that maybe we can enjoy this huge shelves full of mayonaise , mustard , oil and marmelade , but we can &apos;t take the comparison and we can actually pull something out of the amazing supply .
so what i want to suggest to you today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we &apos;ve tested in different ways and different research places -- they can just apply them to their business .
first , close .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never more true than today that less is .
people are always concerned when i say , &quot; close . &quot;
they always worry that they lose the ground .
but in fact , we see more and more and more and more that if you &apos;re ready to close , and the unimportant possibilities are going to go , well , there &apos;s going to be a rising of the sales , it &apos;s going to cost the cost of decision-making .
as a proctor and gamble , the different head and hapways of 26 are reduced to 15 , they experienced a rise of the sales for 10 percent .
when the golden percorporation sold 10 to the worst selling catus , they saw that the profits were coming by 87 percent -- a result of both the rise of the sales and reducing cost .
you know , the average supermacrot today gives you 45,000 products .
a typical wal-mart gives you 100,000 products today .
but the nine-largest supermarket , the largest largest supermarket in the world today , aldi , and they only offer them 1,400 products -- a kind of tomato sauce in doses .
now in the world of savings , i believe one of the best examples that came in the market recently , about how to do the best choices , was something that david laibm has done very strong , it &apos;s a program at harvard .
every harvard harvard now takes automatically to a life-time fund .
those who really want to make a choice will be offered 20 fund , not 300 or more fund .
you know how people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to close it .
it &apos;s all important possibilities . &quot;
and the first thing i ask the employees is , &quot; tell me how the possibilities of each other .
and if your employees can &apos;t keep them apart , it cannot be their clients . &quot;
now before we started lunch today , i had a conversation with gary .
and gary said that he would be willing to offer all of the people in this audience in this audience , to the most beautiful street in the world .
here &apos;s a description of the road .
and i want to read to you the ones .
and now i &apos;m going to give you a couple of seconds to read them and then i ask them to clap when they &apos;re willing to accept gary &apos;s supply .
okay . anybody ready to accept gary &apos;s offer .
are they all ?
well , let me show you a little bit more about it .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
well , who &apos;s ready for this journey .
i think maybe i &apos;ve heard more hands .
good .
the fact is that you &apos;ve seen objective , the first time more information had more information than the second time , but i would paint it to paint it at the second time .
because the images made it real sense for them .
what brings me to the second technology that helps you to deal with the problem of decision-making , it &apos;s the concrete .
it &apos;s the fact that people , to understand the difference between possibilities , needs to understand what the consequences are associated with the individual possibilities , and that the consequences have to be felt and concrete .
why do people spend in average 15 to 30 percent more if they &apos;re using a ec-card or a credit card when they do it ?
because it doesn &apos;t really feel like that .
and it turns out that if you make it that something feels specific , it &apos;s a very good tool to save people to save the people .
so we &apos;ve done in a study that i took with shlomo , and alessandro cohen , we &apos;ve done a study with the people who worked on the table -- workers who have all been working on their pension plan .
and during this meeting , we have this meeting just like you &apos;ve always been , we just added a little thing .
the small thing we &apos;ve added was that we asked people to think about all the positive things that would happen in their lives , if they save money .
in which we did this simple thing , there was a rise of participation to 20 percent and there was a rise of the number of people who were willing to save or a rise to four percent of the money that they were willing to pay for the savings accounts .
the third technology : mapping .
we can deal better with more categories than more choices .
for example , here &apos;s a study that we &apos;ve done in a time test .
it turns out that in the way it &apos;s in the realm of supermarkets and down in the northeast area , the number between 331 different kinds of magazines has led to 664 magazines .
but you know what ?
if i show you 600 magazines , and you split them in 10 categories , or i show you 400 magazines , and these in 20 categories , you believe that i gave you more choices and a better choice than i &apos;d given you to the 400 .
because the categories tell me how to stay apart .
here are two different play-doh caps .
one is called &quot; jazz &quot; and the other one is called &quot; jazz . &quot;
if you think the left ad is consistent and the ad on the right is jazz , then you clap into your hands .
okay , there &apos;s a few .
if you think that on the left on the side , the jazz side is jazz , and that &apos;s the one on the right , you &apos;ll clap .
okay , a few more .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
the one on the left is jazz and the one on the right is freeman , but you know what ?
this is a high-speed unuseful framework .
the categories have to say something , not to tell the choice .
and you see this problem often , if you look at the long bullet points of all these fund .
who do you really want to get ?
my fourth technology : premise for complexity .
it turns out that we can actually deal with more information than we think we have to do .
we have to accelerate complexity .
i &apos;ll show you an example of what i mean .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : the purchase of a car .
here &apos;s a clear car manufacturer that gives you the opportunity to match your car completely itself .
you have to make 62 different decisions to make your car completely .
now these are different decisions in the number of choices that offer you a decision .
car colors , foreign color -- i have 56 options .
motors -- four options .
what i &apos;m doing now is , i change the order in the decisions that make decisions .
half of the customers are going to go from the many possibilities , 56 autocolors to the low possibilities .
the other half of the customers goes from the small possibilities , four motors , to the 56 car colors , many possibilities .
what am i looking at ?
how do you care ?
if you &apos;re constantly using the standard choice in the decision , it means that you &apos;re going to be overstated , i &apos;m losing it .
what they &apos;re finding is that the people who are going to go from the many to the low electors are always going to vote and choose the standard choice .
we lose them .
go from the little choices to the many , then they stay .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
the only thing i &apos;ve done is to change the order of this information .
when i start with the simple start , i &apos;m learning how to choose .
even though the gears choose to say nothing about my preferences in the interior , it still takes me to do it .
it also raises me as excited about the big product that i &apos;m putting together , and so i &apos;m ready to be prepared to be interested in this .
let me summarize .
i told you about four techniques that the problem of decision-making overprofits -- narrow -- are going to make the excess alternatives ; concrete -- do it real ; we can do better with more categories , less possibilities .
every one of those techniques i &apos;m going to describe to you today is to help you manage the opportunities to manage -- good for you , you can use them for yourself , good for the people you offer service .
because i think the key to the best possible choice is that you &apos;re choosing .
and the more we choose to choose , the better we will be able to practice the art of choice .
thank you .
hi . i &apos;m kevin allocca , truss managers at youtube , and i &apos;m looking at youtube videos .
that &apos;s true .
today , we want to talk about how video competing , and then why it &apos;s important at all .
we all want to be stars -- celebrity , singer , proteomics -- when i was young , that seemed so infinitely difficult .
but webvideos have allowed us to be able to do all of our creative activities in a part of the culture of our world .
every single one of you could be about the internet to the next saturday famous .
but youtube is uploaded to more than 48 hours a minute .
it &apos;s just a tiny percentage ever , and it will ever look at thousands of times and so on to the cultural moment .
so how does that work ?
three things : tastemaker , venture communities and unexpected .
well , let &apos;s do it .
oh my god . oh my god .
oh my god !
woah !
whoshhh , wowwww !
last year , freeman vasquez took this video that he filmed in the yosemite national park .
in 2010 , it was 23 million times seen .
this chart shows what it looked like when the video was first popular for the first time .
i didn &apos;t really want to do a viral video .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
because you &apos;re doing this , if you &apos;re called yosemite mountain vibrations .
he had uploaded a lot of natural videos .
and this video was actually sent in january in january .
what &apos;s happening here ?
there came jimmy kimmel .
jimmy kimmel : the tweet that made the video last so popular .
because tastemaker like jimmy kimmel gives us new and interesting things and show you a big audience .
it &apos;s friday , friday . gotta get down friday on friday on friday , and it &apos;s the crossspeed to the equator , mini-. friday , friday , friday , friday -- it didn &apos;t think we would lead this conversation without talking about this video , i hope .
rebecca blacks &quot; friday &quot; is one of the most popular videos of the year .
it was almost 200 million times seen this year .
this is what the graphics looked like .
just like &quot; double rainbow &quot; it seems to be out of nowhere .
what happened this day ?
well , it was friday , that &apos;s right .
if you want to know , these other peaks are open days .
but what about this day , this particular friday ?
now , tosh.zero fored , a lot of blogs started writing about it .
michael j. nelson from the hunter-gatherscience theater was a first one who made a joke on twitter .
it &apos;s important that a single person or a group of tastecs is a point of view , with a big audience , and it raised the process .
and then this community formed by people who shared this big inner act , and started talking about it and playing around with it .
now there &apos;s 10,000 arrangements of &quot; friday &quot; in youtube .
already in the first seven days , there was a thylacine for every single day .
unlike the 20th century of the 20th century , the communities of the community are going to be part of this phenomenon -- either by spreading it or doing something new from it .
&quot; nyan shar&quot; is animation and music in final loop .
that &apos;s it , very simple .
this year , it was almost 50 million times .
and if you keep this for crazy , you should know that there &apos;s a three-hour version of it , which was four million times .
even cats look at this video .
cats look at cats who look at this video .
it &apos;s important , the creativity that exists in the internet culture of techies and geeks .
there were remixes .
someone did an old-fashioned version of it .
and then it became international .
a whole remix community pulled out of the ground that made it by a stupid joke that we can all participate in .
now we don &apos;t just find pleasure on something , we do it .
who could have all of that look ?
who could have been &quot; double rainbow &quot; or rebecca black ?
what would it be like to write your writing in which something is urgent ?
in a world where every minute , two days video can be uploaded , only really unique and unexpected remains like the spoken videos .
i &apos;m not really interested in making a friend when a friend said , i should look at this great video , about a guy who protects in new york against lawings .
i got a ticket because i &apos;m not traveling on the bike path , but there &apos;s a lot of disability that &apos;s not going to go on on the bike path .
and this was completely surprising and humorous , in a sense , casey niestats became funny , and his argument was five million times .
this approach to everything new , which is creative .
and all of that leads to a big question .
what does that mean ?
whohhh .
what does that mean ?
tastemaker , creative communities , totally unexpected , are the characteristics of a new kind of media and culture to anyone who has access to the audience and the audience popular .
as i said , one of the biggest stars -- justin bieber -- did his beginning at youtube .
no one has to give up your ideas .
and today we &apos;re all feeling as owners of our pop culture .
and these are not the characteristics of the old media and they don &apos;t have to meet the media of today , but they will determine the conversation of the future .
thank you .
how can i talk about the interconnectedness of the between women about three generations , and the amazing strength of this interconnectedness in the lives of a four-year-old girl &apos;s life , when she was talking about 30 years ago with her little sister , her mother and her grandmother , and her grandmother , and she would talk to you today ?
the story is not over .
it &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s still put together .
i want to tell you about some of the puzzle bits .
imagine the first piece : a man who burns his life .
he &apos;s a poet , a writer , a man whose whole life of the simple hope of unity and freedom of his home .
keep it in the middle of the communist communist mind , as he wants to stand in , that his life had a single waste .
the words , as long as his friends , is now his .
he moved back to silence .
he died , broke through the history .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i never met him .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
my grandmother never forgot me his life .
i had to make sure that it was not free , and it was my job to learn that the story was really trying to crush us , but we stood .
the next puzzle section shows how a boat in the early morgenred is quiet at sea .
my mother may was 18 , when her father died -- in a arranged marriage , already with two little girls .
for them , life gave her a job : the escape of her family and a new life in australia .
it was totally excluded that it could fail .
after a four-year-old and movie bike saga glitt , a boat on the lake , as a fishing boat .
all adults were aware of the risks .
the biggest fear they had before pirates , rape and death .
like most adults on the boat , my mother was wearing a small toxic bottle .
in a captrap , only my sister and i , you know , would be drinking and my grandmother .
my first memories are from this boat -- the stegend tuckers of the engine , the clapping of any wave on the bug , the length and empty horizon .
i don &apos;t remember the pirates that came to a lot of times , but from the death of the men on our boat , let alone the men who didn &apos;t want to start .
but i remember the lights of oil platform from the malaysia coast , and at the young man who collapsed and died , the end of the journey was too much for him , and the taste of the first aprock that gave me one of the guys on the platform .
no apple ever did it again .
after three months in refugee camp , we landed in melbourne .
and the next puzzle piece is about four women in three generations trying to build a new life together .
we put ourselves in football , one of the status lines , which is the population of imhydratentenal layers .
unlike in the ancient trials , their existence was completely unknown to me , there was no more sophisticated thinking in football .
the smell of the salmon comes from the rest of the world .
and the fatty ones were broken english in between people who had one thing in common : they started new .
my mother worked on farms , then on a running band in a car factory , six days , twice .
it kind of managed to find the time , to get english and the i.mons .
we were poor .
every dollar was divided , and it was put in more education for english and mathematics , no matter what we had to do for it , mostly the new things that came from the second hand .
two few strands for the school , every one of them to cover the holes in the other .
a hundred to the knobs , because she had to do six years .
and there were the rare ones , &quot; worse eye , &quot; and here and there , and there , &quot; asiates , goes home . &quot;
after home ?
something passed on in me .
there was a meeting to reconciliation and a calm voice said , &quot; i &apos;m going to go out of the way . &quot;
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
my mother was exhausted every night , but we told each other about our day , and listened to the movement of our grandmother .
my mother suffered nightmare from the boat .
and it was my job to stay awake every night until her nightmare came , so i could come up with it .
they opened a computer business , and then a costistic training , and they opened a business .
and the women came with their stories about men who didn &apos;t have the change , angry and unflexible , and sorral children , caught between two worlds .
loans and sponsors were tested .
centers were built .
i lived in parallel worlds .
in one , i was the classic asian student who turned himself to himself .
in the other one , i was involved in uncertain life , the tragic scars of violence , the drug abuse and the insulation .
but so many people got over the years .
and because of this help , i was considered to speak in the last year of judaism as a young australist of the year .
and i was taken by a puzzle piece to the next catapulze , and the edges didn &apos;t fit together .
tan le , anonymous habitly of football , now was tan le , refugee and social activist , who was invited to speak to places that they had never heard , and in dorausings , their existence never had imagined .
i was not familiar with labels .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the bribe .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i wanted to go back to the routine , and the comfort of the life of an unknown preorts -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters , who took away every one of her days like 20 years old by telling each other the stories of her day .
i told my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
she reminded me that i was so old now as she was at the time , when we walked the boat .
no one was a possibility .
&quot; just do it , &quot; she said , &quot; and not what you &apos;re not . &quot;
so i talked about jugenesis and education , and the neglected of the marginalized and deposable .
and the more open i was talking , the more i should tell you .
i met people in all the life , so many of them did what they loved , living on the edges of the possible .
and even though i graduated , i realized i couldn &apos;t find myself with a career in jura .
there had to be another puzzle .
and i realized , at the same time , that it &apos;s okay to be an underdog , a new fan , new in the picture -- not just okay , but something you need to be grateful , maybe a gift of the boat .
because dasting can be so easily connected to collapse of the horizontal , so easily it means that you accept the assumptions of the environment .
i went from my comfort now enough to know that , yes , the world is breaking apart , but not as if you &apos;re afraid .
opportunities that wouldn &apos;t have been allowed were explicitly encouraged .
there was a energy , an unambiguous optimism , a strange mixment of humility and the mortal .
so i followed my gut feeling .
i collected a little team of people around me , which is not &quot; an unattached challenge . &quot;
for a year , we had no hair .
at the end of one day , i had a huge pot soup that we shared .
we worked late until late the night .
most of our ideas were crazy , but it was a couple of brilliant things , and we made the breakthrough .
i met the decision to move into the united states .
just a trip there .
my gut feeling again .
three months later , i was moved and the adventure went on .
before i close the lecture , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up at a time , in the confucianananism , the social norm and the local translator .
life had not changed for centuries centuries .
her father died shortly after her birth .
her mother moved her alone .
at 17 , she got the second woman of a translator , whose mother suggested her .
without any support of your husband , she was worried for a fun by brought it in front of the trial , and she was in her own case , and a even bigger thing than she won .
&quot; it &apos;s not &quot; left . &quot;
i was just in a hotel room in sydney when she died . 1,000 miles away in melbourne .
i looked through the dung wall and looked at it on the other side .
i knew they had arrived to say goodbye .
my mother called me a few minutes after that .
a few days later , we went into a buddhist temple in football , and they sat around their sarg .
we told her stories and her insurance that we were still at her .
and by midnight , the monk and said he had to close the rag .
my mother asked us to grab her hand .
she asked the monk , &quot; why is your hand so warm and the rest of you is so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because she has this morning , &quot; he said .
&quot; you didn &apos;t leave them . &quot;
when there &apos;s a band in our family , it comes through the women .
you see who we were and how life has shaped us , we can now see that the men who might have come into our lives would come to the more .
the defeat would have been too simple .
now i &apos;d like to have my own kids , and i still think of the boat .
who would ever want one ?
yes , i &apos;m scared of privilege , prior to ease .
can i give you a bug in your life , the courageous wave trowers , the untary , tusty tuckers of the engine , the long horizon ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give this and make it safe , i would do it .
moreover , mother today is in the fourth or fifth row .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
is it all photography at all ?
because , of course , this is a picture you can &apos;t pick up with your camera .
yet , my interest in photography , when i received my first digital camera , was at age 15 years .
i put it together with my earlier preference , but it was a little different , because the camera was actually in planning .
and if you take a picture of a camera with a camera , the process ends when you squeeze on the trigger .
so for me , photography seemed to be more about the right place to be right at the right time .
i believed everybody could .
so i wanted to create something else , something that the process starts when the trigger is hit .
photographs like this : a blueprint along a long road .
but it has an unexpected twist .
and nevertheless , a realistic level .
or photographs like this -- dark and colorful , but all with the common goal , a realistic level .
when i say reality , i mean a photo-reality .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can actually capture , but i want to make it look like you could have that , on a photograph .
photographs where you have to think a short moment to figure out the trick .
so it &apos;s more about catching an idea than really a moment .
but what is the trick that makes it look realistic ?
is it about the details or the colors ?
is it about the light ?
what creates the illusion ?
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
but ultimately , it &apos;s about how we interpret the world , and how it can be made on a two-dimensional surface .
it &apos;s not about what &apos;s realistic , but what we think is realistic .
so i think the basics are very simple .
i see it as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces and build together to create an alternative reality .
and let me show you a simple example .
we have three complete physical objects that we can identify with all of us in a three-dimensional world .
but in a certain way together , you can create something that looks still three-dimensional , as if it could exist .
but at the same time , we know that this is not possible .
so we have overlists our brains , because our brains simply don &apos;t make it sense .
and i see the same process in combining photographs .
it &apos;s really just to combine different realities .
so the things that make a picture look realistic , i think these are the things we don &apos;t think about , the things around us in our everyday lives .
but if we combine photographs , it &apos;s really important to think about it , because otherwise you just look wrong .
so i would say there &apos;s three simple rules to follow to get a realistic outcome .
as you can see , that &apos;s not three special images .
but you can create something special like this .
so the first rule is that combined photos should have the same perspective .
secondly , combined photos should have the same lighting .
and these two pictures meet these two requirements -- from the same altitude and the same kind of lighting .
third of all , it &apos;s about making it impossible to tell where the individual images start and end by connecting it to seamlessly .
make it impossible to say the picture was actually put together .
so by putting color , contrast and helthness to the edges of the individual images , add up a host of trees , like fielders , disloaded colors and disorders , and let &apos;s put the limits between the various images , even though a picture can be hundreds of planes .
here &apos;s another example .
you might think that this is just a landscape , and the bottom part was being manipulated .
but this picture is actually completely composed , from photos of different places .
i personally found that it &apos;s easier to create a place than to find a place , because you don &apos;t have to make compromise with the ideas in your head .
but it requires a lot of planning .
and when i had this idea in winter , i knew i needed several months to plan them to find the different places of the puzzle .
for example , the fish had been taken on a decent trip .
the bank is from a different place .
the underwater part comes from a quarry .
and yes , i even colored the house on the top of red to make it look red .
so to achieve a realistic outcome , it goes from me to planning .
i start with a gun , an idea .
and then it &apos;s about the combination of the different images .
and here &apos;s a piece of very good planned .
and if you do good photographs , the result can be pretty beautiful , and pretty realistic .
so there are all the tools there , and the only thing that limizes us is our imagination .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to talk to you about why so many electronic health projects failed .
and i think the most important point is that we stopped talking to our patients .
and one of the things that we introduced at the bedhop university was a major audience .
it &apos;s not particularly scientific -- it turns out a cup of coffee or tea , and the patients , family , relatives , &quot; how is it going ? &quot;
how can we help you ? &quot;
and we think we want this to be one of the main problems , why everyone -- perhaps most of the electronic health projects failed : because we stopped listening .
this is my wlani wam . very simple thing .
she &apos;s got a button .
and i wake up every morning .
and yes , i have a job , as you might recognize .
i put my job at 95 kilograms .
it works very simply : every time i wake up , they send my data to google health .
and it &apos;s also going to be called from my general doctor , so he can see where my weight problem lies , not only in the moment i need karological support or something , but also with a look at the past .
but there &apos;s something else .
maybe you know that , i &apos;ve got over 4,000 followers on twitter .
so every morning i wake up on my wlani and people talk to me before i &apos;m sitting in the car , &quot; lunch rather only a little salad today , lucien . &quot;
but this is the largest thing that can happen because this is the group pressure , group forced to help patients help patients , because it could be used against obesity , or it could be patients smoking .
but it could also be used to get people from their chairs , and to get them to play in any kind of game , to control their health better .
next week , this is the market .
it &apos;s going to give this little blood pressure block that you &apos;re putting in an iphone or something like that .
and it will allow people to measure their blood pressure from home , sending it to their doctor , and for example , with others , for something more than 100 dollars .
at this point , the patients come in . they can &apos;t just take control of their own , captain on their own ship , but also help us with healthcare in the face of the challenges that are facing us and the cost of health care , and so on .
make ways that are easy to use and start to hug the patients in the team .
and you can do that through these kinds of ways , but also through crowdsourcing .
and one of the things that we &apos;ve done is i want to share with you a short video .
we have all navigational systems in our cars .
maybe even in our mobile phones .
we know exactly where all the money dispenses are around maastricht .
we know one more where all petrostations are .
and yeah , we can find fast food chains .
but where would the next aed to help this patient ?
we &apos;ve been asking , and nobody knew it .
no one knew where the next life-saving aed was at this moment .
so , what did we do ? we did crowdsourcing in the netherlands .
we built a website , and we asked a human mass , &quot; if you see an aed , please share with us where he is when he &apos;s got , &quot; because sometimes it &apos;s closed during business times , of course .
and over 10,000 aeds have been pushed in the netherlands .
the next step was to find apps for that .
and we designed an app app .
we &apos;ve developed an app for layar , extended reality to find these aeds .
and if you &apos;re in a city like maastricht , and somebody collapsed , you can use your iphone , and within the next few weeks , your microfuel cell phones can save your microfuel .
and today , we don &apos;t want to just think of this as aed4u , like the product , but as well as aeddinus .
and we want to put this on a global level .
and we ask our colleagues around the world , from other universities , which is to help us behave like krolling points , to crowdrate these aeds around the world .
and if you &apos;re in vacation and somebody collapsed , it &apos;s your own relatives or somebody else , you can find such an aed .
the other thing we want to ask is that companies all over the world help us embrace this aethic .
these could be strange , or technicians for example , just to make sure that the hidden aed is still in his place .
please help us and try and make the health not just to do something but take it into your hand .
thank you .
today i &apos;m going to talk about unexpected discoveries .
i work in the solar technology industry .
and my little startup wants us to go to conservation by ...
... it &apos;s the crowdsourcing cure .
here &apos;s a short video about what we do .
oh . a moment .
it might take it until it &apos;s downloaded .
now -- we can just jump through this -- i &apos;m just going to just skip the video .
no .
that &apos;s not ...
okay .
solar technology is ...
oh , my time is over ?
okay . thank you .
so a couple of years ago , i started a program to get the stars in technology and design , a year ago , to take off and work in a environment that is so much everything that they hate , we have them work in the government .
the program called &quot; code for america , &quot; and it &apos;s a bit like the peace force for computer geeks .
we choose several fellows every year and we let them work with urban construction .
instead of sending them to the third world , we send them in rathms .
and there they developed great apps , worked with urban employees .
but what they really do is to show what &apos;s possible today with technology .
so they meet al .
al is a hydrant in the city boston .
here &apos;s what it looks like when he &apos;s looking for a date , but what he really looks for is someone who gets out of it when he &apos;s rocking out , because he knows he &apos;s not very good at branding when he &apos;s covered in a meter of snow .
how did he get to look for this particular kind of aid ?
we had a team of fellows in boston in boston the &quot; code for america . &quot;
they were there in february , and there &apos;s been a lot of sorted in february of february .
and they found that the city never made these hydrant hydrant .
but a particular fellow , a man named erik hawking elenober , noticed something else , and that was that the residents were getting the sidewalks off , right before those parts .
so he did what every good developers would do , he wrote an app .
it &apos;s a nice little app where you can adopt a hydrant .
you love to make it freely available when it hits it .
if you do that , you can give him a name , and he called the first al .
if you don &apos;t do that , somebody can take it away .
so there &apos;s a nice little toy dynamic .
this is a modest little app .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of the 21 apps that the fellows wrote last year .
but she does something that doesn &apos;t do other government technology .
it &apos;s spreading out of time .
there &apos;s this guy in the i.t. department in hong olulu , who saw that he could use this app , not for snow , but in order for the citizens of tsunami .
it &apos;s very important that these tsunami are working , but people steal the batteries .
so he got the citizens to test them .
and then , seattle decided to use the app to get the citizens to clean the peaclys .
and chicago , she just introduced the people to open up the buckets , if it &apos;s flashing .
we now know nine cities that are planning to use this app .
and it has become more robust , organic , of course .
if you know about government technology , you know it doesn &apos;t normally happen that way .
the creation of software takes a few years .
we had a team that worked last year at a project in boston , for the three people two months .
it was about a method that parents can figure out what the real public schools are for their children .
we &apos;ve been told later that when it was going through the normal channels , it would have taken over two years and it would have cost over two million dollars .
and that &apos;s nothing yet .
there &apos;s a project right now in the california sky called the taxpayer so far , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this on any level of government .
so an app that &apos;s written in a couple of days , and then it turns out , is a kind of a shot of the nest on the institution of government .
it shows how the government could work better -- no longer like a private company , how many people think they should .
and not even like a tech company , but rather like the internet itself .
and that means free access , which means open and productive .
and that &apos;s important .
but more importantly , that app is that you represents a new generation , which is the problem of the government -- not as the problem of a creation institution , but as a problem of collective leadership .
and this is a very good news , because it turns out we &apos;re very good in collective action with digital technology .
now there &apos;s a big community of people who make the tools that we need to put things in common together .
it &apos;s not just &quot; code for america , &quot; there are hundreds of people around the country who write up and write government apps every day in their own communities .
they haven &apos;t given the government .
they &apos;re terribly frustrated with their , but they don &apos;t complain about it , they repair them .
and these people know something that we &apos;ve lost from the eyes .
and that is , if you &apos;re all able to get rid of politics and the snake at work and all the other things that we &apos;re really excited about , it &apos;s government , the core , in the words of tim o &apos;reilly , &quot; what we can &apos;t do in common . &quot;
now , a lot of people have given the government .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , please , i want you to think about it because things change .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is in change .
and because the government ended up taking their strength -- remember , &quot; we the people ? &quot; -- how we think about it , will affect how this change happens .
i didn &apos;t know much about government when i started this program .
and how many people , i thought , was mostly about choosing people in a office .
now after two years , i &apos;ve come to the conclusion that it &apos;s mostly about community rats .
this is the call center for service and information .
you usually get out of there when you &apos;re in your city 311 .
if you &apos;ve ever had a chance to work in your urban call center , like our fellow scott silverman , as part of the program -- indeed , you &apos;re going to see that people , you know , the government , the government , in their house .
so scott gets this one .
he &apos;s called &quot; the thylacine rat . &quot;
and he doesn &apos;t really have an idea . he starts with the animal caron .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , can you just open all the doors in your house and play very loud music and see if the livestock ? &quot;
and that worked . for scott .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the thylacines .
it didn &apos;t just have a call center .
it has an app , a web , and manual app , called &quot; citizen connection . &quot;
we didn &apos;t write this app .
this is a very clever piece of people in the new urban settlement in boston .
one day -- this is an actual report -- came to this : &quot; spoporat in my trash . can &apos;t tell if she &apos;s dead .
how do i get them away ? &quot;
but what happens to &quot; citizen connection &quot; is different .
scott underkept to man .
but on &quot; citizen bination &quot; is everything that everybody can see .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
and the next entry we got was , &quot; i went over there , the garbage hole behind the house .
guns ? yes . alive ? yap .
turned the garbage hole on the side . went home .
good night , honey marrat . &quot;
pretty simple .
this is great . here &apos;s the digital thing .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how the government gets to crowdsourcing .
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition of the platform .
i &apos;m more likely to talk about a platform for people to help themselves and to help others .
a citizen helped another citizen , but the government played a central role here .
it connects these two people .
and you could have them connect them to the state of government , if they needed that , but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative to governance services .
if a neighbor helps the other one , we need our communities .
let &apos;s call the animal carater , it costs a lot of money .
one of the most important things is that we need to think that government is not the same as politics .
and most people understand that , but they believe that one is the input of the other .
that our contribution to the system is to choose .
how often did we choose a political leader -- and sometimes we use a lot of energy to choose a new political leader -- and then we lean back and we expect the government , our values , our values , and didn &apos;t have a lot of changes .
this is because the government like a farther ocean is and politics is the supreme 15q. .
and what &apos;s underneath is what we call bureaucracy .
and we use this word with like this .
but it &apos;s that contempt that we own , and for that we pay for , something that works against us , something different , and then we made ourselves .
people seem to think politics is sexy .
if we want this institution to work for us , we have to make bureaucracy sexy .
because this is where the actual government works .
we need to rely on the machinery of the government .
so the classics have done it .
have you seen these guys ?
it &apos;s a group of concern that has written a very detailed 325 page report , which is an answer to the sec carmo over the law reform .
this is not politically active , that &apos;s what business is active .
well , for those of us who have given the government , it &apos;s time that we think about the world that we want to leave our children .
you have to imagine the enormous challenges that you have to imagine .
do we really believe that we have to achieve what we have to do without improving the institution that &apos;s in the name of all of us ?
a government is absolutely necessary , but it has to be more efficient .
the good news is that technology makes it possible to define the function of government in a way that can actually do something by creating society .
and there &apos;s a generation that grew up the internet , and it knows that it &apos;s not so hard to do things together , you have to build the only systems .
now the average age of our fellows is 28 , so i &apos;m , unfortunately , one generation older than most of you .
this is a generation that grew up with their voice for granted .
they &apos;re not fighting that battle that we &apos;re all fighting , so who &apos;s going to be able to speak , they &apos;re all allowed to speak .
they can make their opinion , in every channel , and they do it .
so , if you &apos;re faced with the problem of government , you don &apos;t care very much about using your voices .
they use their hands .
they use their hands to write applications that improve the government of government .
and these apps let us use our hands to improve our communities .
it could be open to a hydrant hydrant , uncrowed , to turn to a red rat with a pink rat .
and sure , we would have these hydrant hydres all the time , and a lot of people do that .
but these apps are like small digital memories that we &apos;re not only consumers , and we &apos;re not only consumers who are paying taxes and users .
we are more than that , we are citizens .
and we won &apos;t improve the government until we improve the national citizenship .
so the question that i have for you all here : if it comes to the big , important things we need to do together , are we going to be a lot of voices , or will we be a lot of hands ?
thank you .
my role is that we can &apos;t tell people how wonderful the new technologies that are coming up are going to be . and i thought , because i &apos;m here under friends , i would tell you what i really think , and i &apos;m going to try and see what &apos;s going on in front of you , which is going to happen so fast , that we can &apos;t get there .
i &apos;m going to start to show you a single one , boring slide .
please show the slide a little bit .
this is a slide i chosen by my folder .
it &apos;s not about the details of the slide , but in fact the general shape .
this slide shows data from us about the performance of risc. processors compared to the performance of a local area networks .
so the interesting thing here is that these slide , like manch , which we often meet in our field , is a sort of smooth logarithmic curve .
in other words , every step here is a power in the performance scale .
and this is a new thing that we need to use this type scale on semi-logarithmic curves in technology .
something very strange is happening here .
this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
so , if you could do the lights again .
something more later because i &apos;m going to draw something on paper here .
now , why do we draw graphs in the technology on semi-logarithmic curves ?
the reason for that is if i would draw it on a regular curve , where , say , this is the years , so the time line of a kind , and this is a kind of time of the technology , which i want to show you , the graph of ridiculous .
that &apos;s what it looks like .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
now , if i want to record another technology , let &apos;s say a transport technology , then that would be very unreasonable at the smallest logarithmic scale , in shape of a flat line .
but when something like this happens , it changes the qualitative conditions .
so if the transportation technology is going to continue as fast as the microprocess technology , then we could get back into a taxi and in 30 seconds , we would be in tokyo .
but that &apos;s not that fast .
there was never before in the history of technology , this kind of recursive growth , which is increasing all the few years exponentially .
the question i want to ask you is , if you look at these exponential curves , you &apos;re not going to go on forever .
it &apos;s not possible that everything is going on forever and forever as fast .
there are two choices .
it &apos;s either going to be a classic curve like this , until something entirely new comes from , or it &apos;s going to happen here .
that &apos;s about it .
well , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think something like this will happen here .
is that really , then it means we &apos;re in the middle of a transition .
we &apos;re here on this line , in a transition from the world to a new kind of world .
so the question i &apos;d like to ask you , and i often think of myself , is this new world ?
what is this new state that makes the world slowly ?
because the transition seems very , very confusing to be in the middle of it .
when i was a kid , the future was in the year 2000 , and people often talked about what would happen in the year 2000 .
now we have a conference where people talk about the future , and you realize that the future is still in 2000 .
and we don &apos;t .
so in other words , the future is thrown by a year since i &apos;m on this world .
i think the reason is that we realize that something is underway .
the transition is happening . we can feel it all .
and we know that right now it doesn &apos;t make sense to try to look at 30 or 50 years into the future because everything will be so different that a simple bill of what we &apos;re doing now doesn &apos;t make sense .
i want to talk about what that might be , this transition in which we are right now .
to do this , i &apos;m going to first talk about some other things that really don &apos;t have to do with technology or computers .
because i think to really understand this , we need to step back and look at the thing on a longer time scale .
and that &apos;s what i want to look at at the time scale of life .
i think the overall picture makes sense when you divide it in some billions of times .
so let &apos;s go back , and that &apos;s 2.5 billion years , and the earth was a big , sterile blob with a lot of the chemicals .
now , if you look at the way that these chemicals were organized , it gives us a pretty good picture about how they did it .
i also think there are theories that begin to understand how everything has started with rna , but i &apos;m going to tell you a story of what is , which is that at that time , little oil drockers were breaking out of chemicals .
some of these oil drockers contain a special combination of chemicals that allowed them to integrate other chemicals from outside to the outside .
all of those things were started to divide .
these little oiled supplies were the most primitive cell form .
but these oil supplies weren &apos;t about living in today &apos;s senses , because every single one of them was just a small coincidence of chemicals .
and every time it divided , the chemicals have spread to unequal amounts .
so each drip was slightly different .
in fact , the drockers grew up which one for growth , faster than others and integrated more and more chemicals from outside and shared .
so these biases tend to survive longer and expand in scale .
so this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but more interesting , when these drockers learned a trick about abstraction .
in any way that we don &apos;t quite understand , these droples are learning to write information .
they &apos;ve learned to store the recipe of the cell as information , and in a particular chemical form that we call dna .
in other words , they have found in this mental , evolutionary way , a way that allowed them to write whatever they were , so that this information could be stored and copied .
the amazing thing about this is that this kind of information is about the time of 2.5 billion years ago where they were born .
it &apos;s actually the recipe for us , which is our genes , from the exact same code and the same typewriting .
and in fact , every organism uses exactly the same letters and the same code .
we &apos;re as far as we can , just for the pleasure purpose , even in this code .
and i have 100 micrograms here , which i have to try to keep in airports from security boards .
there &apos;s -- what i &apos;ve done is i took this code -- the code consists of normal letters , which we use for the symbolic -- and i &apos;ve written my business card for 10 ^ 22 .
so if somebody wants to be a hundred million copies of my business card , i have enough for everybody in this room and even for everyone in this world , and it &apos;s right here .
if i was in reality , i would have been a pity , and i would have written it on a virus .
so what is the next step ?
the dna of dna was an interesting step .
and that underforced these cells -- that made them happy for another billion years .
but then another , very interesting step , when things were completely different , they started communicating these cells and interact with information , so communities come from cells .
i don &apos;t know if you knew that , but bacteria actually can replace their dna .
it &apos;s also why , for example , the disconsistency is growing .
some bacteria have found out how to keep themselves from penicillin and have this information together with other bacteria in dna and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate together .
these communication now allowed the reasons of communities which were in the same boat in the same boat ; they were synertic .
so they either survived together , or they went together , and that meant that if a community was successful , all the individuals of the community were more frequently repeated and by evolution .
now , the exaggeration is there , where these communities are so close together , that they decided to write the recipe for the whole community in a sign on the dna .
and the next interesting stage took about another billion years .
at this point , we have multi-celled communities , communities of many layers of cellulose , which combined as individuals .
in fact , we &apos;re also such a diverse community .
we have a lot of cells that are not based on themselves .
your skin cells are useless without heart cells , muscle cells , brain cells and so on .
so these communities began to continue , so that the level that evolution was happening wasn &apos;t the individual cell , but the whole cell community , which we call organism .
the next step now happened within these communities .
the cell communities began to abstract information again .
and they developed special structures which didn &apos;t do anything else than to process information within the organism .
and these are the neural structures .
so the neurons are the information tool that these cell communities have built .
they started investing in specialists in the community , special structures , which were responsible for learning , understanding information .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
this gave them an evolutionary advantage .
because at this point , there &apos;s an individual -- learning now within the span of a single organism , rather than this evolutionary event .
so a organism , for example , could learn not to eat a particular frueit because they were bad and made it sick , the last time he was eating them .
now , this could happen within the lifetime of a single organism , whereas hundreds of thousands of years ago , because this information had to be learned from the individuals who had died because of this fruit , which had not been there .
so the nervous system has the evolutionary process with this particular information structure , because evolution could now occur within an individual event .
it could happen within a time learning framework .
what happened after that is that the individual organisms found a way to communicate each other .
so , as an example , the most subtle one of these communication types is the human language .
it &apos;s quite an amazing invention when you think about it .
i have a very complicated , unreasonable and confused idea in my head .
i &apos;m sitting here , and i &apos;m basically giving some basic sounds of me in the hope of creating a kind of puzzled idea in your head that has some kind of resemblance with my original idea .
so we take something very complicated , turning it into sound , a sequence of sound , and produce something very complicated in the heads of others .
so this allows us to work again as a unified organism .
and what we actually did , we , the human , is to abstract .
we &apos;re going to go through the same stages , which have made a lot of cell organisms through -- the abstraction of our methods to capture data , to present .
the invention of language was a little step in that direction .
telephone , computer , video games , cd roms and so on are all our specialized mechanisms that we built in our community to have this information .
and it connects us all together to something that is much bigger , and it &apos;s also able to evolve faster than we &apos;ve been .
so today , evolution can happen over microseconds of microseconds .
you also saw tys little evolutionary example where he showed a little bit of evolution in the convolous program , right before your eyes .
so we &apos;ve regraded the timeline again .
the first steps of history , which i told you about , is a billion years a piece .
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , a few hundred million years .
and then , overnight , steps , like language and so on , less likely than a million years .
and this next steps , like electronics , seem very few decades to take .
the process is feeding itself , and so i think that car catalytic is the word for this -- if something increases its pace .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
and i think that &apos;s what we see here in this explody curve .
we see the process that feeds itself .
i live from building computers from building computers , and i know that i &apos;m going to use the mechanism that i &apos;m using to build computers , not using the long-term progress in the computer technology .
my current activity is to design objects with such a complex complexity that it &apos;s impossible to design this in traditional sense .
i don &apos;t know what every transistor is doing in binary machinery .
it has billions of those .
what i do instead , and what the designers of thinking is doing is we think of a certain level of abstract levels , this machine and the machine makes it something that makes our capabilities go beyond , better and faster than we could ever do .
and she does it partly with ways that we don &apos;t even understand right now .
a method which is particularly interesting , and what i &apos;ve been using recently is the evolution itself .
we install a evolutionary process in the machine , which is going to happen in the microsewsecond area .
to call an example , in the most extreme cases , we can create a program which is developed out of random instructions .
we say , &quot; computers , generic please , a hundred million distinct sequences of ininstructions .
now , all of this happens to happen , all of this randomly chosen ininstructions , takes all the programs , and pick the ones that are my closest ones . &quot;
so in other words , i first define what i want .
let &apos;s say , i want to take numbers , that would be a simple example that i &apos;ve been using for that .
so , find programs which can be measured by the most husbands .
of course , the chance of chance , in random ininstructions , is very small that it &apos;s a number of numbers of sound , so you may not actually have to do this .
but one of those likes to be with happiness two numbers in the right order .
now i &apos;m saying , &quot; computers , take those 10 percent of the sequences , which got my preconceived the next one .
the rest of it , the rest .
now they &apos;re all reserving the remaining ones who have the numbers at best sorted .
and with a method of recombining , analog to reproduction . &quot;
take two programs and they produce children through the exchange of their subroues , and the children of the subroues of the subroues of the two programs .
so , i &apos;ve got a new generation of programs that came through combinations of programs that have come up with a little bit closer than others .
tell , &quot; please repeat this process . &quot;
commitment it again .
take some mutations .
and try and do this again with another generation .
all of these generations only need a few milliseconds .
and so i can run an evolution over millions of years in the computer , or in more complex cases , some hours .
finally , i get programs that can get numbers perfectly close .
in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i could have ever written by hand .
when i look at these programs , i can &apos;t say how they work .
i tried to understand them .
it &apos;s clearing and strange programs .
but they do the job .
i know , i &apos;m sure that they do the job , because they come from a range of thousands of programs , which have done the job .
because your life depended on whether you did the job right .
i sat in a 747 in a 747 with marvin minsky , and he comes up with a map , and he says , &quot; oh look . look at this .
there &apos;s , &quot; this airplane is hundreds of thousands of pieces that work together to make their flight safer . &quot; don &apos;t make you reliable ? &quot;
we know that a developmental process is not optimal when it becomes too complicated .
so we &apos;re starting to rely on computers for a process which is different from the classic engineering .
he allows us to do things with a much higher complexity than it would allow us to produce .
and yet , we &apos;re not quite understanding of it .
so ladies overfall technology .
we &apos;re using these programs now to make the computers a lot faster , so that we can do these processes even faster .
so it creates feedback .
it gets faster and faster and i think that &apos;s why it seems to be so confusing .
because all these new technologies are feeding themselves from themselves .
we pick up .
we are at one point , which is analog at the time , when cell organisms have evolved to become multi-cell organisms .
so we &apos;re the amobs , and we can &apos;t yet figure out what the hell we &apos;re doing here .
we &apos;re in the middle of the spot .
but i really believe that there &apos;s something going on .
i find it very high from us to say that we are the end product of evolution .
and i think we all here are part of the creation of what &apos;s next .
now lunch is before and i &apos;m thinking i &apos;m going to hear now , before i &apos;m going to get rselected .
my story starts right here in rajasthan , about two years ago .
i was in the desert sky in the desert with sufi-singer muhimi ali .
we talked about that nothing has changed since the ancient indian era , &quot; mahabharata . &quot;
if we wanted to travel in indians at the time , we went to a car and smash over the sky .
now we do this with airplanes .
when the great indian warrior argla arst had arjuna durst , he took a bow , shot in the floor and water .
now we do this with weapons and machines .
we came to the conclusion that the magic and magic was replaced by machines .
that really made me sad .
i was scared about technology .
it was scared that i could lose the ability to enjoy the sun set , without a camera , without tweet to my friends .
i thought technology should make magic possible and not kill .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little silver pocket clock .
this piece of 50 years old technology became the magest thing for me .
it became a new access to a world full of pirates and contaminated ships and images in my imagination .
it came to me when we looked at our fancy clocks and the cameras .
they were inspired by this .
and so i went into the world of technology to see how i could use it to make magic rather than killing .
with 16 , i started painting books .
when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a device that can connect the readers around the world .
it can know how we hold it .
it can know where we are .
it lets images and text together , and animation , sounds and touch .
the storytelling used more senses .
but what do we do with that ?
i just go to khoya , an interactive ipad app .
here &apos;s : &quot; put your fingers on every light . &quot;
and so -- this is , &quot; this box is , &quot; i write my name .
and from me , a character will be in the book .
and again , a letter for me falls down -- and the ipad knows through gps where i live -- that &apos;s right to deal with me .
the kid in me is really excited .
i &apos;ve talked a lot about magic .
i don &apos;t mean a magician and kits , but the magic of childhood , the ideas we all had as children .
fireflies in a glass i found quite exciting .
so you have to roll the ipad out here and get the fireflies out .
and the light path through the rest of the book .
another idea that fascinated me as a child is that a whole galaxy can put in a single murmel .
and this is why every book , every single world , and every world that i &apos;m going to collect here is the magic device in the device .
and this opens up a map .
fantasy books always had maps , but these cards were static .
this map is growing and illuminating and serves for guidance in the rest of the book .
it turns out to be in other places of the book .
i &apos;m going in here .
it &apos;s also important for me to create something that is inefficient , but it &apos;s also very time .
this is the apsaras .
we &apos;ve all heard of feeins and nybers , but how many people outside india know their indian colleagues , the apsaras ?
the poor apsaras were thousands of years in indras , in a old-old book .
and we bring them back , in a contemporary story for children .
a story that goes apart with new issues , like the environmental crisis .
the theme of environmental crisis , a big problem for the last 10 years , is that kids in their rooms are sitting on their computers , without their computers .
but now with mobile technology , we can take our children into the natural world with their technology .
in an interaction of the book , you &apos;re sent to a search . you have to go out and collect the camera of the ipads of the id images .
as a child , i had collections of stories , rocks , kitrles and shells .
somehow the kids don &apos;t do anymore .
this childhood ritual will go back . you have to go out to make a picture of a flower , and tag it .
in another chapter , you have to image a piece of tree imaging and tag .
so you actually create a digital collection of photographs that you can put online .
a child in london shows the picture of a pure and says , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve seen a fusion . &quot;
a kid in india says , &quot; i &apos;ve seen a monkey . &quot;
this creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photos that you actually recorded .
there &apos;s a variety of ways that the magic and technology is connecting to each other .
in the next book , we &apos;re planning an interaction in which you use the video of the ipads and you see an animation of eles that appear on a plant in front of the house .
in a place , the screen moves with leaves .
you have to make the sound of the wind , you &apos;re going to pick up bubbles and the rest of the book .
we all move to a world where the natural forces are moving closer and closer in the magic and the magic and technology .
we use the energy of the sun .
we bring our children and we closer to the natural world and the magic , fun and love of our childhood through the simple medium of a story .
thank you .
this is really an extraordinary honor for me .
i spend most of my time researching people in research , prisons or death cells .
i spend most of my time with the social weakest in social contractions and places where there are a lot of hope .
to be here at ted , seeing and hearing how stimulating that is , i have given a lot of power .
in the short period here , i realized that ted has an identity .
you can say things here that have influence the world .
and sometimes , when something comes about ted , it gets a meaning and power that otherwise wouldn &apos;t have .
i say that because i think identity is very important .
we &apos;ve seen some fantastic presentations .
i think we &apos;ve learned that the words of an apprentice have meaning , but the words of a dedicated textbook are particularly meaningful .
as a doctor , you can do good . as a doctor , you can do more .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
i didn &apos;t learn this in my work as a lawyer .
i learned that from my grandmother .
i became big in a family , a traditional african-american household , which was created by a matriarchan , and that matriarch was my grandmother .
she was a boreal , strong woman , she had effect .
she had the last word in every family fight .
it was also the origin of a lot of differences in our family .
she was the daughter of slave family .
their parents were born in the 1840s in virginia as a slave .
she was born in 1880 , and the experience of slavery shaped a very strong picture .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also loving .
when i met them as a little boy , she came to me and hupped me .
they hit me so that i could barely breathe . then they let me go .
one or two hours later , when i met her , she came up to me and she said , &quot; bryan , do you feel my hug ? &quot;
and if i said &quot; no , &quot; she answered me again . if i said , &quot; yes , let me leave you . &quot;
it was something that was made that you wanted to be near .
the only problem was they had 10 children .
my mother was the youngest of 10 children .
sometimes if i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to get her attention .
my cousins went around .
i remember being eight , i have to be eight , that i woke up one morning and went to the living room . all my cousins fell around .
my grandmother was sitting at the end of the room .
first of all , i thought that was a game .
i looked at her and she smiles , but she looked very serious .
this was 15 or 20 minutes , and then she stood up and she came to me . she took me to the hand and she said , &quot; come on , bryan . you have to talk . &quot;
i remember it as if it was yesterday .
i will never forget it .
she took me outside , and she said , &quot; bryan , i &apos;ll tell you something , but you have to promise that you &apos;re not going to say it . &quot;
i said , &quot; promised , grandma . &quot;
she said , &quot; honor word ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
she sat down and looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to know that i &apos;ve looked at you . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re a little special . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do anything you want to do . &quot;
i will never forget that .
she said , &quot; you &apos;ve got to promise me three things , bryan . &quot;
i said , &quot; ok , grandma . &quot;
she said , &quot; first of all , i &apos;m going to say you &apos;re going to love your mom . &quot;
she said , &quot; your mom is my baby and you have to talk to promise that you &apos;re always going to take care of you . &quot;
i told my mother , so i said , &quot; yes , grandma , i &apos;ll do that . &quot;
and then she said , &quot; next to me , i &apos;m going to say you &apos;re going to always do the right thing . &quot;
i thought , &quot; yes , grandma . i promise it . &quot;
finally , she said , &quot; the last thing you have to promise me is that you &apos;re never going to drink alcohol . &quot;
well , i was nine years old , and i said , &quot; yes , grandma . i promise it . &quot;
i grew up on the land , in ancient south and rural , and i have a brother who &apos;s older and a year younger sister .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home and brought this sixth pack beer to my sister and went to the forest .
we were just terrified there as well .
then he took a drink beer and he offered my sister &apos;s one , and she took me , and then she offered me one .
i said , &quot; no , no , no . all right . all right . i don &apos;t want a beer . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; well , do it . now we &apos;re doing it , you &apos;re doing anything else .
i had something , your sister had what . go , drink a beer . &quot;
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to . you just do . &quot;
my brother was staring at me .
he said , &quot; well , what &apos;s wrong with you ? well , what do you drink ? &quot;
then he looked at me , and he said , &quot; oh no , you don &apos;t always make you crazy because of the conversation with grandma ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; grandma &apos;s telling everybody that they &apos;re special . &quot;
i was devastated by the floor .
i &apos;m going to give you something .
i should not do that .
this is maybe going to transfer public spaces .
i &apos;m 52 years old , and i realized i &apos;ve never had a drop of alcohol .
i don &apos;t say that because i think it &apos;s tuedy . i say it &apos;s because identity means it .
if we create the right kind of identity , we can tell people about things that they don &apos;t believe first .
we can get them to do things that they thought they could not .
of course , my grandmother would say all their favorites , they &apos;re something special .
my grandfather was in prison during the prohibition .
my uncle died of alcory diseases .
and she believed that this was the subjects that we need to care about .
i &apos;ve tried to say something about our justice system .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
1972 were 300,000 people in one-to-old and prison .
today it &apos;s 2.3 million .
the united states today has the highest incarceration rate of the world .
seven million people are left on currency or unconditioned crimes .
in my opinion , mass incarcerations are fundamentally changing our world .
in socially weak and black parts of the population , despair and hopelessness , because of these changes .
one of three male black black between 18 and 30 is in prison , in prison , on a procurrency , or with inconditional gridlock .
in urban communities all over the country -- from los angeles across philadelphia , baltimore to washington -- are 50 to 60 percent of all black young young men either in prison , in prison , in prison , in the prison .
but our system is not just shaped by questions that have to do with rasoucity , it &apos;s also draining by poverty .
we have a justice system in this country that you &apos;re treated much better if you &apos;re rich and guilty than you are poor and innocent .
wealth , not debt , affects the outcome .
however , we seem to be satisfied .
a politics of fear and anger has convinced us that these problems are not our problems .
we lost the touch .
i find that interesting .
there &apos;s a couple of interesting developments .
my home state , in alabama , pulls out the election right now , if you &apos;re convicted of being executed .
here , in alabama , today , 34 percent of the male black people have lost their election properly .
we predict that in 10 years the rate of the civic honor is going to be so high as before the census of election law .
the silence is ocynumb .
i commit kids .
many of my clients are very young .
the united states of america is the only country in the world , which is three-and-a-half year-old children to death in prison .
in this country , there is no longer life for children &apos;s lives .
we have a lot of process running .
the only country in the world .
i &apos;ll add people into death cells .
the death penalty question is an interesting question .
we believe because you &apos;ve taught us that the real question is : does a human being deserve to die for one of them ?
this is a very sensitive question .
but you can also think about it , depending on how we see our identity .
the other point is not : does anybody deserve a crime for a crime , but did we deserve it ?
i find that fascinating .
the death penalty is defined by error .
on nine people we have executed , one that we &apos;ve been engaged in for innocent , who was released and out of death cell .
an amazing error rate . one of nine .
i find that fascinating .
we would never let anyone fly with an airplane , if for nine planes , the shooting off .
but somehow we create it from this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden .
it &apos;s not our struggle .
i &apos;m talking a lot about these questions .
i &apos;m talking about race and the question if we have the right to kill .
and it &apos;s exciting because i teach my students in african-american , i talk about slavery .
i talk about terrorism , the time against reconstruction , to the beginning of the world war war .
we don &apos;t really know a lot about it .
but for the african-american americans in this country , it was a time of terror .
in many areas , people had to fear lynchmobs .
or bombs .
it was the fear of terror that shaped their lives .
these older people now come to me and say , &quot; mr. , stevenson , you talk , you &apos;re talking about the people , you tell the people that you should stop saying it &apos;s the first time in our nation &apos;s history . &quot;
they say , &quot; no , no , tell people that we grew up . &quot;
and after terrorism , of course , the lawsuits came out and decades of the rassistic motivations and apartheid .
and yet , in our country , there is a dynamic -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our history .
and that &apos;s why we don &apos;t really understand what our actions are in the historical context .
we constantly repel .
we &apos;re always creating new instructions and conflicts .
it &apos;s hard to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to be the truth of the truth and reconciliation .
in south africa , people have understood that the lawsuits are not too overcome without the willingness to truth and reconciliation .
even after the genocide in rwanda , there were these claims , but not in this country .
i &apos;ve spent some talks in germany about death penalty .
it was fascinating because one of the scientists stood up after my talk and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply disturbing , you &apos;re talking about it . &quot;
he said , &quot; in germany there &apos;s no death .
and of course , it can never give you more . &quot;
it was very quiet . then a woman said , &quot; with our history , it &apos;s impossible that we &apos;ll ever kill ourselves for the systematic of people .
it would be clear of us , aware and target people . &quot;
i thought about it .
how it would feel to live in a world where german state would leave people , especially if there were a lot of jews beneath it .
it would be vital .
it would be clear .
and yet , here in this country , in the united states of the south indian , we put people on -- here &apos;s the risk to be convicted of death , 11 times higher when the victim is white , when it &apos;s black , if it &apos;s black .
and yet there &apos;s this mental composition .
i think our identity is threatened .
if we don &apos;t deal with that with these difficult topics , the positive and wonderful things are affected .
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity .
we love entertainment .
but ultimately , these realities are being overstated by suffering , abuse , condemmation .
i think it &apos;s important to unite both .
because we ultimately talk about that we need more hope , more commitment , more commitment to get in a complex world .
for me , it means time for me to think and talk about the poor , the disadvanished , who will never be at ted .
but think of a way that is embedded in our own lives .
we all have to believe the last thing we can &apos;t see .
we do it . so we &apos;re rational , as we are so rational .
innovation , creativity , and development isn &apos;t just coming from our heads .
they come from ideas that are driven by belief in our hearts .
it &apos;s this headhead race , which i think is driving us , not just being open to all the bright and exciting things , but also for the dark and problematic .
linearlav halan , the great chemeic politician , once said .
&quot; when we fought in eastern europe , we wanted to do all kinds of things , but what we needed most was hope , a spiritual orientation , the willingness , sometimes to be hopeless , sometimes to be more hopeful . &quot;
this mental orientation is the core of what i think also the ted communities have to do for it .
there &apos;s no disconnect around technology and design that allows us to be completely human , as long as we don &apos;t have eyes and ears for poverty , it &apos;s indominating and injustice .
i want to warn you . this kind of identity requires much more of us than if we don &apos;t do it .
it &apos;s going to touch them deeply .
as a young lawyer , i met the great privilege to meet pink parks .
and she went back to montgomery , and she went back to montgomery , where she had two of her oldest friends , john , never carr , who had organized the montgomery-bus boymet -- an incredible african-american -- and virginia durr , a white , whose husband , clifford durr .
so these women were just meeting and signed .
and then a woman named carr carr , and then said , &quot; bryan , woman come into the city . we want to speak .
do you want to come and listen ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yes , really like . &quot;
she said , &quot; and what are you going to do when you &apos;re here ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
and i went over and just listened .
it was so inspiring , it was so inspiring .
one day , i sat there and i listened to this women , and after a few hours , a woman turned to me to say , &quot; well bryan , tell me what it is for the passenger right .
what do you try to achieve ? &quot;
i started with my usual talk .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to go against injustice .
wr wants to help people who were innocent .
we want to evaluate ourselves and discrimination in the criminal justice system .
we want to create life budget without interdependence with kids .
we want to do something against death workers .
we want to lower the number of crochers .
we want to create mass incarcerations .
i gave my usual talk , and after that , she looked at me and he said , &quot; mhmm . mhmm . &quot;
she said , &quot; it will be very , very tired . &quot;
then lady carr came to me , put a finger on my face and said , &quot; and therefore , you have to be very , very tallous . &quot;
and so i think the ted community should be tahorse .
we need to make ways . we have to ask these challenges : these problems , this suffering .
because ultimately , our humanity depends on our humanity .
in my work , i learned very simple things .
i learned a couple of simple things .
we all are more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
i think that &apos;s true for everyone on the planet .
if someone is lying , it &apos;s not just a liar .
if somebody takes something that doesn &apos;t hear it , it &apos;s not just a burb .
even who kills someone is not just a murderer .
and because this is , there &apos;s a basic human dignity to respect the law .
i also believe in many parts of this country , and in many parts of the world , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i don &apos;t think so .
i believe in many places that are the opposite of poverty .
and finally , i think , although it &apos;s so dramatic , so beautiful and inspiring , and so excited , we don &apos;t get measured at the end of our technology , not about things that we &apos;re developing not on our intellect and minds .
finally , a society is not measured by how they treat their rich and powerful and privileged , but about how they deal with the poor , the incarcerated .
because in this context , we first start to understand the really astonishing things that make us .
sometimes i lose the balance . a story to finish .
sometimes i hate too much .
i &apos;m getting tired of how we all .
sometimes these ideas continue ahead of our thinking , in a very important way .
i &apos;m offering these kids to be very frustrating .
i &apos;m going to go to the research prison and visit a client who likes to be 13 or 14 years old , and the adult is supposed to stand in front of trial .
then i wonder : how could this happen ?
how can an judge turn someone into something that he doesn &apos;t ?
the judge looks at him as adults , but i see a child .
one night i stayed up and i thought , oh my goodness , if a judge can turn us into something else , then he has to have magic forces .
right , bryan , the judge has magic forces .
you should also wish them .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t really think more about it , i began to work on a demand .
i had a 14-year-old , poor black young young than a client .
and i started with this thing , and the headline was , &quot; inplacement , my arms , 14-year-old manlets like a privileged , white , 75-year-old , two-year-olds . &quot;
in my inadvantage , i explained that misconduct of state and the police as well should be concerned .
there was a crazy line about it that there &apos;s nothing in this country that there is only misbehavior .
the next morning , i woke up , and i didn &apos;t know if i knew this crazy thing , or he was actually writing it .
and i was not just writing him , but i sent him to the court .
a few months warning , and i had just forgotten everything .
but finally , i decided , my god , i have to go to the court and this crazy case .
i got into the car , and i was really overwhelmed .
so i went to the court .
and i thought that &apos;s so hard , that &apos;s so painful .
i ended up walking out of my car , and i went up to the court .
when i cut the staircase up to the court , there was an older man , black man , the janitors in the court .
when he saw me , he came to me and he said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
he came to me and hupped me .
then he went to the ear .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
and i have to say , there was power .
it touched something very deeply in me , identity , the ability to contribute every single one , to a community of hope .
well , i entered the court .
once the judge saw me .
he said , &quot; mr. stevenson , did you put that crazy ? &quot;
i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and then we started discussing .
more and more people came in , just because they were angry .
that i had written these crazy things .
police officers came in and deputing state officials and office workers .
in the circuit , the court was full of people who were angry , that we talked about skin factors , about inequality .
from my hand angle , i saw the janitors and go off .
he saw over the window , and he could hear the whole tohuwbean .
he went down and down .
finally , the older black man came up with a very accomplished facial expressions in the court and sat right behind me , almost on the bank bank .
ten minutes later , the judge announced a pause .
during the pause , a police officer came in , that the janitors were in the court .
this deputy ran over to the older black .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do in the court ? &quot;
the older black man stood up . he saw deputy , and he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;ve come to say , &quot; i &apos;ve come to say to this young man , don &apos;t give you the goal of the eyes . give it not . &quot;
i &apos;ve come to ted because i think many of you have understood that the moral pendulation of the universe is far out of the universe , but that it &apos;s the justice .
that as humans , we &apos;re not completely developed as long as we don &apos;t care about human rights and basic values .
that all of our survival is connected to each other .
that we have to connect our visions of technology and design , of entertainment and creativity with humanity , compassion and justice .
and most of all , i &apos;d like to share with you that that &apos;s just as simple , just say , don &apos;t lose the goal , don &apos;t give up .
you &apos;ve seen this audience , this community , this community , and it belongs to you and do something .
what else can we do ?
bryan stevenson : well , there are opportunities everywhere .
if you live in california , there &apos;s a census in this spring where it &apos;s about actually taking a effort to do something about the money that &apos;s going to flow into the politics of punishment .
here , in california , for example , you &apos;re going to have a billion dollars for the death penalty , a billion dollars .
and yet , of course , 46 percent of all the nodelidelidelidelities didn &apos;t do with a dissection .
56 percent of all rape cases don &apos;t come in trial .
here &apos;s the opportunity to do something .
this phrase is going to suggest the money in more security forces and safety .
i think there are opportunities everywhere .
during the last three decades , the crime rate is huge in america .
this is a fact that &apos;s often asked in a context with the elevated rates .
what would you say to someone who believes that ?
now , in fact , the number of nonviolent crimes has not changed very much .
most of the mass incarcerations in this country found not really in the class of nonviolent crimes .
it was the misguided trial against drugs .
that &apos;s why the dramatic figures come in the prison inmates .
we cut ourselves down from the rhetoric of punishment .
now , we &apos;ve got three-dimensional law laws that make people always behind bars , for a bicycle towel , for the larlless good , rather good , instead of giving them power to the sacrifice .
i think we need to do more to help people become the victims of a traffic , not less .
and i think our current punishment scores are not helping anybody .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
bryan , they actually brought a string up here .
they &apos;re an inspirational personality .
thank you for having been at ted . thank you very much .
bin laden is taking a risk risk of risk .
two : famine in somalia . three : pepper spray .
four : malignant kartelle . speakers five : dangerous cross ships .
two : social discrimination : 65 : 65 dead .
bellamiwarning : tsunami 9 / 7 : cyber attacks
different drug wars . mass weapons . freeman .
recession . arrest . doomsday . egypt . syria . syria .
crisis . death . disaster .
oh my god .
so these are just some of the clips that i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- it could have been the last six days , or the last six years .
the fact is that the media prefer to show us negative issues because our minds are paying attention to these topics .
and there &apos;s also a very good reason for that .
every second , our senses will start much more information than our brain can ever process .
and because we have nothing more important than our survival , the first stop for all the information is part of our temporal lobe , the amygdala .
so the amygdala is our early warning system , our risk detector .
it attracted to the whole information on the search for any reason in our environment .
so if we see the news , we prefer to look for negative news .
and the old adage , when it &apos;s bleeding , the demand is very true .
now , with all our digital devices that seven days a week , 24 hours a day , 24 hours a day , it &apos;s not a miracle that we &apos;re pessimistic .
it &apos;s not a miracle that everybody thinks it &apos;s always worse .
but possibly this is not the case .
maybe that &apos;s the reality .
perhaps the tremendous progress that we &apos;ve been doing in the last century has made a series of forces so strong that it will be possible in the next three decades , a world of overstream .
well , i &apos;m not saying that we don &apos;t have big problems -- climate crisis , wildlife , markets , water and energy problems -- we already have .
and as humans , we &apos;re much better at looking at problems in a very long way , but they eventually get to overcome .
so let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve done in the last century , so we can anticipate the development .
in the last 100 years , the average life expectancy has increased more than doubled the inflation of the world &apos;s population .
child mortality has reduced a tenth .
and that &apos;s where the food waste , electrical power , transportation costs and communication costs are reduced to a multiscale .
steve pinker has shown us that we currently live in a very peaceful time of human history .
and charles kenny is the study of literacy in the last 130 years from 25 percent to 80 percent .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and many people forget this .
and we keep growing our expectations continuously .
in fact , we redefined poverty .
remember that a great percentage of americans who live under poverty is access to electricity , water , toilets , refrigerators , firephones , mobile phones and cars .
the richest capitalists of the last century , the empires of the earth , would never have given those luxury goods .
the basis for a lot of it is making technologies , and these are growing expotentially .
my good friend ray kurzweil has shown us that every tool that &apos;s going to go to information technology on the curve of moore &apos;s law is great , and the price performance of 12 to 24 months .
that &apos;s why the mobile phone costs about a million times less and is a thousand times faster than a supercomputer from the &apos; 70s .
now look at this curve .
this is the last hundred years of moore &apos;s law .
notice two things on this curve .
first , how much it is -- in good time , in bad times , war or peace , depression , depression , depression .
this is the result of faster computers building faster computers .
they slow down for none of our big problems .
also , despite their logarithmic value on the left , they &apos;re going up .
so growth rate is accelerating .
and on this curve , on the back of moore &apos;s law , we find a series of extraordinary technologies that are available to everyone .
&quot; cloud computing , &quot; something which i call my friends to autodesk , &quot; physically ite-computing computing , &quot; sensors and networks , robots , 3d materials , that allow us to democratize the personal production in our planet , synthetic materials , and artificial , digital medicine .
how many of you have seen the victory of ibm supercomputer at risk ?
that was the grandios .
i once went through the newspapers , looking for the best headlines i could find .
i love this : &quot; watson forces human enemy . &quot;
&quot; risk &quot; is not a simple game .
it &apos;s about understanding the nuances of language .
imagine that this artificial intelligence is available to each owner of a mobile phone .
four years ago , ray kurzweil and i started here at ted a new university called singularity university .
we bring our students all these technologies , with particular focus on how these can be used to solve the great challenges of humanity .
and every year we ask the students to create businesses , products and services that can live within a decade of a decade of people .
think about that , a group of students today can influence the lives of billions of people .
thirty years ago , this would have been ridiculed .
today we can put in dozens of companies that have done exactly this .
when i think about creating abundance , i don &apos;t mean a life of luxury for everyone on this planet ; it &apos;s about making a life full of opportunities .
it &apos;s about making scarce power abundance .
in fact , scarcity is contextion , and technology is a resource force .
here &apos;s an example .
this is the story of napoleon iii in the middle of the 18th century .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
he invited the king of siam to dinner .
napoleons soldiers got silver minerals , napoleon himself got gold .
but the king of siam did that aluminum .
aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet , valuable than gold and platin .
this is why the dome of the tamington can come out aluminum .
even though aluminum takes about 8.3 percent of the earth &apos;s mass , it &apos;s not as a pure metal .
it &apos;s linked to oxygen and contracts .
but then the technology of the electrolysis was developed and made aluminum so cheap that we use it with our path mentality .
then let &apos;s put this analogy into the future .
we &apos;re thinking today about energy scarcity .
ladies and gentlemen , we live on a planet of the 5,000-times more energy than we consume every year .
16 terawatts of energy all 88 minutes of the earth &apos;s surface .
it &apos;s not about scarcity , the problem is accessible .
and there &apos;s good news .
in this year , you &apos;ve done it for the first time to reduce the cost of solar energy in india to 50 percent of the hack -- 8,8 rupees compared compared to 17 rupees .
the cost of solar energy dropped over 50 percent last year .
last month , this has been published with a study that shows that until the end of this decade in the ocean , there are 6 cents to the end of the u.s. of the united states .
and if we have a energy overshot , we &apos;re also going to have water on it .
let &apos;s talk about water wars .
do you remember that as carl sagan &apos;s the hallacger spacecraft in 1990 , when it was moved by saturn , back to earth ?
he took a famous photograph . how did it go ?
&quot; a memorial blue dot . &quot;
because we live on a water planet .
we live on a planet that &apos;s covered in 70 percent of water .
yes , it &apos;s 97.5 percent of salds , two percent , and we fight around 0.5 percent of the water on the planet , but there &apos;s also hope .
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
it &apos;s new pandegies on the way , nano-materials .
and from a conversation , this morning with dean kaman , one of the innovators of do it , i want to share with you -- he gave me the permission -- he gave me the permission -- his technogy , the &quot; slingshot , &quot; and the many of you may have heard about it . it &apos;s the size of a refrigerator .
it can produce a thousand gallons of clean water a day -- whether salt , polluted water , latrine -- and all that for less than two cents per liter .
the director of coca-cola has just begun to launch a very large project with a hundred units in developing countries .
and when everything goes well , and i &apos;m very confident , then coca-cola will apply this technology globally in 206 countries around the planet .
this is a technology support innovation that is today .
and we also saw this in mobile phones .
oh my god , we &apos;re going to get to the 70 percent rate of mobile phones in developing countries until the end of 2013 .
just think that a mai warrior with a mobile phone in the middle of kenya has a better mobile communication than president reagan 25 years ago .
and if you look for your smartphone on google , you have more access to knowing and information as president clinton 15 years ago .
they live in a world that has information and communication in the abundance of how nobody could ever have predicted .
and it &apos;s even better , the things that you and i &apos;ve spent several thousand dollars -- gps , hd video and photograph , libraries full of books and music , technology to medical diagnostics -- will literally be personalized and cheaper in your cell phone .
and the best part of that is perhaps what we expect in health .
in the last month , i had the pleasure , with gravel foundation , called the &quot; $ 10 million grate tricordes x prize . &quot;
we &apos;re asking teams all over the world to connect all these technologies together in a cell phone , that you can talk to the device , because it &apos;s armed with ai , you can zoom in or your blood values .
and to win , the device has to be a better diagnosis than a team of highly skilled doctors .
imagine this device . in a developing country , where there is no doctors , but 25 percent of the disease burden and 1.3 percent of the staff of healthcare .
if this device was sequenced , or dna virus , that &apos;s not known , it calls health care and prevents a pandemic in front of you .
but now the biggest force that &apos;s going to lead us to a world of the transstream .
i call them &quot; the coming billion &quot; .
the white lines are for population .
we &apos;ve just crossed the seven-billion-dollar brand .
and by the way , the biggest absurration against a population explosion is a better education and food in the world .
in 2010 , we had just connected to two billion people online .
by 2020 , we get ahead of two billion internet users .
three billion new minds , of whom we &apos;ve never heard before , will join the global communication .
what need these people need ?
what will they consume ? what will they want ?
and instead of economic gridlock , i see one of the largest economic conventions of history .
these people represent multiple trillion dollars that are going into the global economy .
and they &apos;re going to be healthier by the use of the tricoders , and they &apos;re getting better educated by the khan academy , and that they will have the ability to use 3d printers and &quot; cloudcomputing , &quot; and so much more productive than ever before .
so what can three billion growing years , healthy , educated , productive members of the human community ?
how about a set of new , never heard of hearing voices before ?
how about it , the oppressed wherever you are , to give a voice to make sure and create change , for the very first time ?
what are these three billion people going to bring ?
how about beiformity that we can &apos;t even predict ?
one of the things that i learned from the x prize is that little teams that are motivated by passion and focus can create extraordinary things , things that could only create large companies and governments in the past .
i want to close with a story that really excites me .
there &apos;s a program that some might know .
it &apos;s a game called foldit .
it was developed in the university of washington in seattle .
and it &apos;s a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids to study how the protein will evolve .
according to his behavior , we can predict the structure and function .
and this is very important in medical research .
so far , this was a problem for supercomputer .
and this game was done by university professors and so on .
and it &apos;s now hundreds of thousands of people who played the game online .
and it showed that today &apos;s human pattern recognition is more than the best supercomputer .
and when these people came and looked , who &apos;s the best one in the world , this wasn &apos;t an mit professor , also no calorganic student , it was somebody from england , in manchester , a woman who was working in a redefined clinic at night , and at night the best magnetism of the business .
ladies and gentlemen , which gives me enormous trust in our future , is the fact that today we have more power than individuals to provide the great challenges of our planet .
we have access to the tools of exponential technology .
we have the passion of a diy innovators .
we have the capital of techno-philanthropy .
and we have three billion new minds that we can work with online to master the new challenges , and to do what is needed .
we expect some remarkable decades .
thank you .
i think we need to do something against a transformative piece of medical culture .
and i think it starts with a medical doctor and i &apos;m .
and maybe i &apos;m a long time in business when i can give it to me a piece of my own wrong way to enable this .
but before i get to the actual theme of my talk , let &apos;s start with a little baseball .
hey , why not ?
we are the seasonal near and moving to the world championship .
we all love baseball , right ?
baseball is full of great statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
&quot; moneyball &quot; comes soon and turns around statistics and to use this a great baseball team .
i &apos;m going to look at a statistic that i hope most of you have already heard of .
it &apos;s the average performance of the bat .
we talk about a 300 , if a bat beat 300 .
that means that the player is perfectly three beats .
that &apos;s called the ball in the outside , he &apos;s coming , he &apos;s not caught , and who &apos;s trying to throw the ball to the first base , it didn &apos;t make it in time , and the runner was in safety .
three out .
do you know what &apos;s called a 300th in big orleans baseball ?
well , really good , maybe a fine star .
you know how to call a 400th ?
this is somebody who &apos;s safe in the rest of the world .
legendary , like ted williams legendary , the last major league of baseball players in a regular season about 400 times .
let &apos;s go back to the world of medicine in the world where i feel a lot of wealth , or maybe a little less likely for me to talk to you about that .
suppose you &apos;ve got a blind mentor , and you &apos;ll be overstated to an operateur , whose average performance is 400 in terms of blind distress .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
imagine life in a particular area , and you have a beloved people with clogged heart disease , and you have a doctor &apos;s doctor to put it into a cardiologist whose average performance is at 200 .
but , you know what ?
she &apos;s a lot better this year . she &apos;s on the rise .
and she &apos;s a 257 .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
what do you think about the average performance for a carrot or a nurse or a nurse or an orthopediman , should be a rescue leader ?
a thousand , very good .
the truth is that nobody in the whole medicine knows what a good surgeon or a doctor should be .
what we do , however , is that we &apos;re in every one of them , including the world to be perfect .
never make a mistake , no one &apos;s going to worry about the details of how this should be done .
and that &apos;s the message i took in medical school .
i was a compulacious lonely student .
in high school , once in high school , she said that brian goldman would learn for a blood test .
and so it was .
and i learned in my little roof in the nurses of the toronto , in the nurses of general hospital , unfar from here .
i learned everything .
in my anatomic talk , i learned the origins , and every branch of every musment , every branch of one , which takes away from the aorta , surskors and ordinary differential diagnostics .
i even knew how to classify the differential diagnosis in renvalable tubucan .
and the very time i got more and more knowledge .
and i was good , i graduated with cum laude .
and i left the student with the impression that i knew , if i knew everything and knew everything , or at least as much as possible , as close as possible , that i was importrait to make mistakes .
and it worked for a time until i met my wife &apos;s printer .
i was more resistant to a hospital hospital here in toronto when i was a woman &apos;s printer in toronto .
at this point , i was the karological layer in the karology service .
and it was my brief , when the emergency workers were searching to study the emergency patient .
and feedback on my top doctor .
i studied the printer , and she was in respiratory distress .
and when i listened to her , she made a cone noise .
and when i heard her chest with the stethoskes , i could hear a crack of the sound on both sides , which told me she was suffering under conreliable heart failure .
this is a state in which the heart is failing , rather than pumps the entire blood , a part of the blood hits it in the lung , and that sort of constant , breathing .
and that was not a hard diagnosis .
i hired her and made me care .
i gave her an imitation . i gave her medicine to take the pressure from the heart .
and i gave her medicine that we call diuretics , water pills , so she would release the fluid .
and over a period of a to two hours , it started to feel better .
i felt really good .
and i made my first mistake ; i sent them home .
i actually made two errors .
i sent them home without my chief doctor .
i didn &apos;t take the bite , and i did what i would have had to do with a call to my doctor , so that he would have had a chance to make a picture .
and he knew she would have been able to transfer additional information to her .
maybe i did it with good reason .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be a good doctor .
maybe i wanted to be so successful , so i could be able to take responsibility that i was so and so able to worry about my patients without having to contact it .
my second mistake was worse .
that &apos;s where i sent them home , i prayed a silent voice in me , who tried to say , &quot; goldman , no good idea . do it not . &quot;
in fact , i got so excited about self-security that i asked the nurse , which was a woman &apos;s printer , &quot; do you think it &apos;s okay when you go home ? &quot;
and the nurse thought about it and said , &quot; sure , i think it &apos;ll be good . &quot;
i remember it was yesterday .
so i underdrew the dissection and a hospital and a hospital car and brought them home .
and i went back to work .
the rest of the day i had this feeling in my stomach .
but i worked on .
and at the end of the day , i grabbed my things , leaving the hospital and went to the parking park to drive back home when i did something else i didn &apos;t do .
i went home to the emergency department of my way home .
and there was another nurse saying , not the sister who had seen the printer after woman , but another three words to me and those three words that most of the emergency doctors i know .
other doctors fear this as well , but the emergency medicine is very , very special because we see the patients just like this .
the three words : do you remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patients they signed home ? &quot;
the nurse said yes .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in this particular clay bar .
so she was back .
she was back and she was dying .
about an hour after you arrived at home , after i sent them home , they collapsed , and the family called 911 . the rescue assistant brought them back to the emergency station with 50 , which is dangerous .
she didn &apos;t breathe and was blue .
the emergency staff did all the strands .
they gave her blood pressure .
she took her to the boat machine .
i was shocked and down to the inner .
and i went through these axes because they went to the intensive care station , and i hoped they would recover .
and after two , three days realized they would never return .
she didn &apos;t have copyright brain damage .
their family gathered .
and over the course of the next eight or nine days , they gave it a shot .
on the newy-day day , they would go -- woman &apos;s printer , a woman , mother and grandmother .
you say that you will never forget the names of the people who die .
and that was the first time i learned this myself .
the next couple of weeks , i gave up , and i first found myself the unhealthy shame that exists in our medical culture -- i felt myself alone , isolated , not the kind of healthy shame that you feel because you cannot talk about the colleagues about it .
you know all of the healthy shame , if you give a secret of the best friend for the best friend , even though this one is on an order of intersanority and then you get to the best friend , and then the best friend leads to that kind of mistake .
if you do refine and never make the mistakes again .
this is the kind of educational shame .
the imhealthy way that i &apos;m talking about is the one in the inner sick .
it &apos;s the one that says that this is not what you &apos;ve done , but it &apos;s bad for yourself .
and that was what i felt .
and it wasn &apos;t because of my doctor , he was very upset .
he was talking to the family , and i &apos;m sure he was the sheer glass and sure that i was not going to suck .
but i continued to ask these questions .
why didn &apos;t i ask the top doctor ? why did i get it home ?
and then in my worst moments : how could i make such a dumb mistake ?
why did i go to medicine ?
but slowly , it made it secure .
i started feeling better .
and then at a cused day , there was a hole in the clouds , and the sun collapsed and i could feel better again .
and i was with myself that if i had doubled my efforts to the perfection , and never again a mistake , that the voice could be missed .
and she did .
and i worked on .
and then it happened again .
two years later , i had service in the emergency hospital in a community hospital north of toronto , and i had a 25 year-old man with raised rails .
it was much less and i &apos;m in a hurry .
he always showed up here .
i looked into the rackets and it was a little bit of pink .
and i gave him a certificate for penicillin and sent him on .
and as he walked out of the door , he showed up on his throat .
two days later , i came to my next emergency service and my editors asked me to a conversation in her office .
and she said the three words : do you remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patients with the born rackers ? &quot;
it turns out he was infection .
he had potentially a potentially dangerous disease called beglottis .
you can hear this google , but it &apos;s not an infection of the rails , but it &apos;s the top lanes , and it causes the respiratory lanes .
and fortunately , he died .
he got intravenous anti-bobotica and raised a few days later .
and i went back through the same torsal of shame and self-doubt , felt free , and went back to work until it was again and again and again .
in an emergency layer , i &apos;ve been looking at two times a blind mentor .
there &apos;s a lot of this , especially if you think you &apos;re working in a hospital that was only 14 patients a night .
in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home , and there was no man in their treatment .
i thought he &apos;d have been kidney stones .
and i put the x-ray of the kide . when that was without an enmission , my colleague turned back to the patient &apos;s imagination in the bottom right , and called the operates .
the other one had diarrhea .
i wrester to rehyd him and asked my colleagues to express him too .
and that &apos;s what he did , and when he proposed a diin-down in the right , he called the operates .
in both cases , opedy and it was fine .
both cases of me , ask me .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst mistake happened only in the first five years , what many of my colleagues claim , but total nonsense .
some of my favorites happened in the last five years .
alone , shame and no support .
here &apos;s the problem : if i don &apos;t finish with my mistakes and can talk about them , if i can tell the silent voice that i can tell you , what didn &apos;t really happen , how can i do it with my colleagues ?
how can i teach them my mistakes so that they don &apos;t commit the same ?
if i was in a room -- like now , i have no idea what you think about me .
when did you hear the last time of someone who talked about failures about failures ?
oh yeah , you go to a cocktail party and you may hear about any other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody talking about their own mistakes .
if i was in a room full of colleagues and to ask their immediate support , and to tell them what i &apos;ve just told you , i would probably not get to the end of the second story before it really would give you a joke and the rest .
and in fact , if i knew or my colleagues , that an orthopedide in my hospital would have taken the wrong leg , then you think i &apos;d have problems to look at him in the eyes .
that &apos;s the system we live in .
it &apos;s a totally denial of mistakes .
it &apos;s a system in which there are two basic positions -- those who make mistakes and those who don &apos;t do it . those who are dying of sleep , and the ones who have good outcomes and the good results .
it &apos;s almost an ideological response like antibodies that will attack people .
and there &apos;s the idea that if we make those who make mistakes out of medicine , we have a secure system .
but there are two problems .
in my about 20 years of the medical mind , and journalism , i &apos;ve created a personal medical study on medical mistakes and false treatments to make all kinds of things for my first article i do for the toronto star i wrote for the toronto star .
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely unfair .
we &apos;re working in a system in which every day in which one of 10 medications can either be wrong or wrong , in the hospital infections , and are going to cause , and will cause dead .
in this state , about 24,000 canadians die of extinct mistakes .
in the united states , deciphering the institute for medicine in 100,000 .
both of these are strong subdue because we don &apos;t think of the problem as we should .
and is the crux .
in a hospital system that has doubled all two to three years , we can &apos;t keep up .
sleep is ubiquitous .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we have a cognitive error , so we can take a perfect disease over a patient with breast pain .
and then i take the same patients with breast pain , and they &apos;re sweating it , and let &apos;s give it a little bit of an alcoholic breath and all of a sudden , the story goes through .
i don &apos;t take the same course .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things like that .
and my patients are not cars ; they don &apos;t always tell me their symptoms in the same way .
all of these are errors inevitable .
so if you take the system like that , how i &apos;ve been taught , and all the faulties of health care , then there &apos;s no one left .
and do you know about people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
in my show &quot; white , &quot; black art , &quot; i have the habit to say , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; i would say to everyone from the rescue to the chefarance of the cardiologist , &quot; this is my worst mistake , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , sir , blah , sir , sir , sir , what about your ? &quot; and then , with the microphone .
and then their pills expand , they &apos;re hit before the head , and then they look down , and they &apos;re hard to tell and start telling their stories .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
they want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistakes i made . &quot;
what you need is a environment that makes you possible .
what you need is a new medical culture .
and it starts with a doctor .
the redefined physician is a human being , and he knows his humanity , accepted , is not proud of making mistakes , but does everything to learn from them so that it can be passed .
they share their experiences with others .
they communicate when others are talking about their mistakes .
and it shows other mistakes , not to be at the bottom , but in a loving way that all of them benefit .
and it works in a medical culture that recognizes that people fill the system with life and when that is , then people make mistakes from time to time .
so that the system that we have evolved is to create backups , which make it easier to get out of the way that people inevitably do , and it makes it equally valuable to create supportive of the people who are actually going to be able to look at the kind of potential errors , and that &apos;s what we need to be rewarded for .
my name is brian goldman .
i &apos;m a redefined doctor .
i &apos;m a human . i make mistakes .
but i &apos;m going to try to do it , but i &apos;m trying to learn to learn from others .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re holding , but i can live with that .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny little idea .
it &apos;s about changing ultrasound .
and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i &apos;m going to tell you three stories earlier to use the time .
the first story is charles darwin , one of my heroes .
you know , he was in 1835 here .
you might think he &apos;s fined , but that &apos;s not true .
actually , he gathered fish .
he described one of those as a very &quot; common . &quot;
it was a group .
in the &apos; 80s , in the &apos; 80s , it was made in big style .
now he &apos;s on the red list .
this is a story we &apos;ve heard a lot of times from the galapagos , or from other places , it &apos;s not very special .
yet , we still get to the galak islands .
we still think they &apos;re originally .
the brockers are still describing them as untouched .
what &apos;s happening here ?
the second story is going to be a different concept , which is changing more shifts .
because i experienced it when i was in 1971 in 1971 .
i went there because i grew up in europe and i wanted to work later in africa .
i thought i could integrate myself .
and i got a bad sunfire , and i was convinced that i really didn &apos;t go from there .
it was my first sunfire .
as you can see , the lagogoe of palms and a couple of mangroves covered .
there was buntbaran from about 20 inches , schwarzkots , a subspecies of color .
the fishes of these colorful buntons were very high , and the fishermen lived well about it , and they were well-average in ghana .
when i returned to 27 years later , the fish went down to half of his size .
they grow up by five centimeters .
they were genetically modified .
it was still fish .
people were still happy .
and the fish also had happiness to be there .
so it doesn &apos;t change anything , and yet everything has changed .
my third little story tells you about my co-edition at the introduction of ship trawled in southeast asia .
in the &apos; 70s -- rather at the beginning of the &apos; 60s , europe gave a lot of development projects .
fishing training meant countries that were already going to say 100,000 fish , the industrial fishery of this quite ugly ship .
i was driving on it , and we put in the entire southern south china , and especially in the javasee .
we didn &apos;t have words for what we started there .
i know it was the bottom of the ocean .
90 percent of our fangs were weakant , other animals that are connected to the cause .
the largest part of the fish , the little dots there on the blade of vellight , the trudes , were coral reef fish .
essentially , the bottom of the sea came up , and then it was thrown back .
these images are extraordinary , because the transition goes very fast .
within a year , you take a census and then start with the trade fish .
the reason it &apos;s going to change is , in this case -- in this case -- a hard reason or a soft coral will be mattered .
this is a dead turtle .
they weren &apos;t eaten , they threw them away because they were dead .
once we started an alive .
she wasn &apos;t enough yet .
then they wanted to kill them , because you could eat them well .
in fact , this mountain of copy is accumulated by fish every time they go into areas where they &apos;ve never been caught .
it &apos;s not going to be documented .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
we fit our interventions to the new level , and we don &apos;t think about what was there .
if you generalize it , what happens .
on the y-axis , there are some good things : biodiversity , number of orca , the green of your country , the water supply .
over time , it changes . it changes because for the people , their actions are completely natural .
every generation is looking at the images that you pick up at the beginning of your conscious life , as standard and everything from it .
the difference is then being seen as a loss .
but they don &apos;t take the previous losses .
there can be a sequence of changes .
and at the end , they just want to get the former world remains .
now that &apos;s largely our goal .
we want to get things that are disappeared or things that are no longer like they were .
you might think that the problem is that the problem of people who certainly lived as they lived in predators were killing animals , and they were only aware of a few generations , which they had done .
because obviously , an animal is going to have it very often , first before it dies .
so you don &apos;t get a lot of pre-coming animals .
you &apos;re always losing the animals .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not going to be seen as a loss .
at the time we focus on the big animals and the sea , that &apos;s the big fish .
they &apos;re less likely to catch them .
over time , there &apos;s a little fish left , and we think that &apos;s the score .
the question is , why do people accept it ?
well , because they don &apos;t know it was different .
of course , many people , scientists , confirm that it was really different .
they &apos;re going to confirm it because the evidence , as they were in a previous form , are not as they would like the evidence .
so , for example , there &apos;s the anecdote that the report of a capitalism kind of looked like this in this area , cannot be used by fishing or fishing scientists normally , because it doesn &apos;t mean &quot; scientific . &quot;
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , although we live in educated societies because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
this shows the enormous role that can play a marine reserve .
because in marine reserves , we basically put the past back .
we &apos;re looking back at the past that people can &apos;t understand because the instruction changes and they &apos;re very low .
so the people who can see a marine reserve and benefit from the perception that allows them to go back to their standards .
what about the people who aren &apos;t possible , because they don &apos;t have access to the people in the middle west ?
here , i think the art and the film may fill the gap , and simulation .
this is the simulation of chesapeake bay .
a long time ago , there were gray whales -- 500 years ago .
and the color notes and sattizations may remember &quot; avatar . &quot;
if you think about &quot; avatar , &quot; when you think about why people have been touched by this -- except from the pocahonian story , why were they so touched by the image world ?
because it calls something that &apos;s lost in a certain way .
so my recommendation , the only one i &apos;m going to give you , is cameron , so he &apos;s spinning &quot; avatar ii . &quot;
thank you .
in the &apos; 80s , in the communist east germany , you had to , if you had a writing machine in the government .
they also had to convey a leaf with unprecedented text from this written machine .
the reason for this : the government could pursue where a text came from .
they did a paper with false thought , so they could find the creators of this thought .
and in the west , we couldn &apos;t understand how anybody could do something like this , and how much that would restrict the freedom of freedom .
in our own countries , we would never do that .
but if you buy a new dylaser printer today in 2011 from the leading laser printer , and print a page , then this page has bright yellow spock on every page , in a pattern that makes the page clear to you and retrace your printer .
this is what happens today .
and nobody seems to be there .
and this was an example of what our own governments are doing against us , the citizens .
and this is one of the three main sources of the existing problems today .
let &apos;s look at what really happens in the world : we can split attacks into categories .
we have three main groups .
there are online criminals .
for example , here &apos;s mr. hunter &apos;s golubow made of gw in ukraine .
and the industries of online criminals are very easy to understand .
these people deserve money .
they use online attacks to earn a lot of money , a huge bunch of money .
there are several known cases of online million-multi, multimillionle-based , which you have money through attacks .
this is wladime tsastsin from stetu in estonia .
this is alfred gonzi .
stephen watt .
bjlocal sundin .
these are matthew anderson , tariq al-dasty and so on .
these guys have come up online , but they have illegal , for example , by using trojans , for example , to steal money from our bank bank , as we do our online banking , or a keylogger that we &apos;ve collected on the keyboard , while we &apos;re going to build on a growing computer online .
the u.s. intelligence agency , two months ago , the swiss account of mr. sam jain , and on this account was 14.9 million dollars , when it was burned .
mr. jain himself is on free-foot , which is unknown .
and i &apos;m going to argue that today it &apos;s likely to be more likely to be a victim of a online endeavor than in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is going to be worse .
in the future , most crime will play online .
the second largest age team we can see today are not motivated by money .
they are motivated by something else -- protests , one opinion , or their audience .
groups like anonymous are up over the last 12 months , and they become one of the main players in the field of online attacks .
so these are the three main attacks : criminals , who do it because of the money , hackers like anonymous , who are using resistance , but the last group are nations , governments who run attacks .
there are cases of how the diginotar is .
it shows unprecedented what happens when governments attack their own citizens .
elinotar is a complete capital vehicle of the netherlands -- it was it .
in the last fall , it had to invence , because stuinotar was hacked .
someone was crushed and had the system hacked .
and last week in a meeting with dutch government , i asked one of the senior people to see if he was able to do it for possible , because of the diginotar hacks .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
now , how do people die like this ?
elinotar is a certificate .
they sell certificate .
what do you do with your certificate ?
now , a certificate you need when you have a website with hle encryptes , with dil encryptes , for example .
now we &apos;re all using , or many of us , gmail or one of their competitors , but these services are particularly prevalent in totalitarian states such as iran , where they can use the local government to be able to use more than local crops , because they know the local government , they can &apos;t have more trust than they are in their talks .
but if you &apos;re in a foreign .
certificate with hacking and fake certificate .
and that &apos;s what happens in the case of diginotar .
how about the arab spring and the things that are going on in egypt ?
well , in egypt logger , the adtested in april of 2011 , the headquarters in the headquarters of the egyptian intelligence police , and they found a lot of records .
in these records , a folder called &quot; finfisher . &quot;
and in this folder , notes of one in germany owned a team that was selling the egyptian government a few programs that they were -- in very large scale -- in a very large frame of communication .
they had sold this program for 280,000 euros to the egyptian government .
the headquarters headquarters is right here .
so western governments feed totalitarian governments with aid to help their own citizens .
but western governments also help themselves .
for example , in germany , only a couple of weeks ago found what was called the state janans , which was a trojan , who used to be used by german government services to hunt their own citizens .
if you &apos;re in favor of a criminal case , it will be almost safety .
but today we &apos;re far beyond this .
they tap up their internet connection .
they use tools like the state of the state to hunt their computer with a trojan , which allows them to hear their entire communication discussions , their online discussions .
so if we think about these things , the obvious answer would be people : &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it &apos;s not about me because i &apos;m a braver citizen .
i don &apos;t have to worry !
i don &apos;t have to hide . &quot;
and this argument doesn &apos;t make sense .
privacy has to be given .
privacy is not about debate .
it &apos;s not a choice between privacy and safety .
it &apos;s a choice between freedom and control .
and as we are today , in 2011 , our governments love to trust , it &apos;s every right , that we &apos;re going to give up forever .
and we trust , we trust blind of any future government , a government we may have in 50 years ?
these are the questions that we have to do for the next 50 years .
it may seem strange to you , but i &apos;m a big fan of concrete block .
the first concrete blockstones were produced in 1868 , and they had a simple idea : stack of cement with explicit measurements that fit .
concrete building blocks were very fast in the world .
they put us up to build things that were bigger than we , buildings , bridges , a rock after the other .
essentially , the concrete building block was the building block of our time .
almost a hundred years later , in 1947 , lego came out of this .
it &apos;s called automatically bonds .
and within less years , lego in every household took place .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion rocks were produced -- or 75 stones for every person on this planet .
you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to create beautiful homes , beautiful bridges or beautiful buildings .
lego made it possible for everyone .
lego basically has the concrete building block , the building block of the world , and created a building block for our imagination .
in the meantime , in the same year at the bell labs , the next revolution was announced , the next building block .
the transistor was a little plastic unit that was given us from a world of the static , recycled building blocks in which everything was interactive .
like the concrete block , the transistor allows us to build much more complex circular cycles , a stone after the other .
but there &apos;s a major difference : the transistor was just for experts .
i personally accept that , the building block of our time for experts , and so i decided to change that .
eight years ago , i was at the media lab , and i started to explore this idea of how to do the power of engineers in the hand of artists and designers .
a few years ago , i began to develop littlife .
let me show you how they work .
littomness is electronic modulation , which have a specific function .
they &apos;re predetermined , light , sound , engine and sensor .
and the best thing about it is they connect with magnets .
so you can &apos;t put them wrong .
the rocks are coloring .
green is copy , blue is electricity , pink is one-core and orange .
so everything you have to do is you have to connect a blue and a green one , and you can build it very quickly .
they add a blue one to green , and they can make light .
you can put a switch in between and you &apos;ve created a little dimmer .
take the switch out around a pullows that &apos;s here , and you &apos;ve made a little blind .
add this buzzer for a greater effect , and they made an noise machine .
i &apos;ll stop that .
beyond the simple play , licro is actually pretty powerful .
instead of coding , you have to code , or you have to be able to code , you have to have liatable to code with simple , intuitive gestures .
so to accelerate this , or slow it down , just turn on this button , and it makes the impulse faster or slow .
the idea behind it is that it &apos;s a growing library .
we want to bring every single interaction in the world into a utilize .
lights , light , solar elements , motors -- everything should be available .
we &apos;ve spread littable to kids and see them playing with it .
and it was an incredible experience .
the most beautiful thing is how you start to understand the electronics they &apos;re in the day-to-day world and they don &apos;t learn in school .
like a night light , it works , or why the doors of the open to stick , or how an ipod react to touch .
we also brought littomality to design schools .
so , for example , we had designers with no experience in electronic things that started playing with littliving as a material .
here we see , with filz , paper and water bottles , like georents ...
a few weeks ago , we brought littlife to risd , and we gave them some designers who had no technical experience -- only box , wood and paper -- and they said , &quot; what . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project that they made , a movement of activated conventions .
but wait , this is really my favorite project .
it &apos;s a hummer of dough , the fear of darkness .
for this non-engineers , littlife was another material , and electronics was just another material .
and we want to make this material available for everyone .
so licro is open source .
you can go to the website , all the design models and make it yourself .
we want the world of creating the creator , the inventor , because this world , in which we live , these interactive world , belongs to us .
so , pull down and start to invent .
thank you .
